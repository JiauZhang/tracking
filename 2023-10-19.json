        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11501",
        "abstract": "Recent work has aimed to capture nuances of human behavior by using LLMs to simulate responses from particular demographics in settings like social science experiments and public opinion surveys. However, there are currently no established ways to discuss or evaluate the quality of such LLM simulations. Moreover, there is growing concern that these LLM simulations are flattened caricatures of the personas that they aim to simulate, failing to capture the multidimensionality of people and perpetuating stereotypes. To bridge these gaps, we present CoMPosT, a framework to characterize LLM simulations using four dimensions: Context, Model, Persona, and Topic. We use this framework to measure open-ended LLM simulations' susceptibility to caricature, defined via two criteria: individuation and exaggeration. We evaluate the level of caricature in scenarios from existing work on LLM simulations. We find that for GPT-4, simulations of certain demographics (political and marginalized groups) and topics (general, uncontroversial) are highly susceptible to caricature. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11511",
        "abstract": "Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11513",
        "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in diffusion models, multimodal pretraining, and efficient finetuning have led to an explosion of text-to-image generative models. Given human evaluation is expensive and difficult to scale, automated methods are critical for evaluating the increasingly large number of new models. However, most current automated evaluation metrics like FID or CLIPScore only offer a holistic measure of image quality or image-text alignment, and are unsuited for fine-grained or instance-level analysis. In this paper, we introduce GenEval, an object-focused framework to evaluate compositional image properties such as object co-occurrence, position, count, and color. We show that current object detection models can be leveraged to evaluate text-to-image models on a variety of generation tasks with strong human agreement, and that other discriminative vision models can be linked to this pipeline to further verify properties like object color. We then evaluate several open-source text-to-image models and analyze their relative generative capabilities on our benchmark. We find that recent models demonstrate significant improvement on these tasks, though they are still lacking in complex capabilities such as spatial relations and attribute binding. Finally, we demonstrate how GenEval might be used to help discover existing failure modes, in order to inform development of the next generation of text-to-image models. Our code to run the GenEval framework is publicly available at https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval. "

        "abstract": "Many applications of large language models (LLMs), ranging from chatbots to creative writing, require nuanced subjective judgments that can differ significantly across different groups. Existing alignment algorithms can be expensive to align for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data and computation for real-world use cases. We introduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot manner. In GPO, we augment the base LLM with an independent transformer module trained to predict the preferences of a group for the LLM generations. For few-shot learning, we parameterize this module as an in-context autoregressive transformer and train it via meta-learning on several groups. We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks. These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic groups, global countries, and individual users. Our results demonstrate that GPO not only aligns models more accurately but also requires fewer group-specific preferences, and less training and inference computing resources, outperforming existing strategies such as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the usage of large language models (LLMs) to improve the performance of competitive speech recognition systems. Different from traditional language models that focus on one single data domain, the rise of LLMs brings us the opportunity to push the limit of state-of-the-art ASR performance, and at the same time to achieve higher robustness and generalize effectively across multiple domains. Motivated by this, we propose a novel multi-stage approach to combine traditional language model re-scoring and LLM prompting. Specifically, the proposed method has two stages: the first stage uses a language model to re-score an N-best list of ASR hypotheses and run a confidence check; The second stage uses prompts to a LLM to perform ASR error correction on less confident results from the first stage. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing a 10% ~ 20% relative improvement in WER over a competitive ASR system -- across multiple test domains. "

        "abstract": "Data generation and analysis is a fundamental aspect of many industries and disciplines, from strategic decision making in business to research in the physical and social sciences. However, data generated using software and algorithms can be subject to biases and errors. These can be due to problems with the original software, default settings that do not align with the specific needs of the situation, or even deeper problems with the underlying theories and models. This paper proposes an advanced search and optimization framework aimed at generating and choosing optimal source code capable of correcting errors and biases from previous versions to address typical problems in software systems specializing in data analysis and generation, especially those in the corporate and data science world. Applying this framework multiple times on the same software system would incrementally improve the quality of the output results. It uses Solomonoff Induction as a sound theoretical basis, extending it with Kolmogorov Conditional Complexity, a novel adaptation, to evaluate a set of candidate programs. We propose the use of generative models for the creation of this set of programs, with special emphasis on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high quality code. "

        "abstract": "Personalized text generation presents a specialized mechanism for delivering content that is specific to a user's personal context. While the research progress in this area has been rapid, evaluation still presents a challenge. Traditional automated metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE primarily measure lexical similarity to human-written references, and are not able to distinguish personalization from other subtle semantic aspects, thus falling short of capturing the nuances of personalized generated content quality. On the other hand, human judgments are costly to obtain, especially in the realm of personalized evaluation. Inspired by these challenges, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating personalized text generation, and examine their ability to understand nuanced user context. We present AuPEL, a novel evaluation method that distills three major semantic aspects of the generated text: personalization, quality and relevance, and automatically measures these aspects. To validate the effectiveness of AuPEL, we design carefully controlled experiments and compare the accuracy of the evaluation judgments made by LLMs versus that of judgements made by human annotators, and conduct rigorous analyses of the consistency and sensitivity of the proposed metric. We find that, compared to existing evaluation metrics, AuPEL not only distinguishes and ranks models based on their personalization abilities more accurately, but also presents commendable consistency and efficiency for this task. Our work suggests that using LLMs as the evaluators of personalized text generation is superior to traditional text similarity metrics, even though interesting new challenges still remain. "

        "abstract": "Today, the security of many domains rely on the use of Machine Learning to detect threats, identify vulnerabilities, and safeguard systems from attacks. Recently, transformer architectures have improved the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks such as malware detection and network intrusion detection. But, before abandoning current approaches to transformers, it is crucial to understand their properties and implications on cybersecurity applications. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of transformers to adversarial samples for system defenders (i.e., resiliency to adversarial perturbations generated on different types of architectures) and their adversarial strength for system attackers (i.e., transferability of adversarial samples generated by transformers to other target models). To that effect, we first fine-tune a set of pre-trained transformer, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and hybrid (an ensemble of transformer and CNN) models to solve different downstream image-based tasks. Then, we use an attack algorithm to craft 19,367 adversarial examples on each model for each task. The transferability of these adversarial examples is measured by evaluating each set on other models to determine which models offer more adversarial strength, and consequently, more robustness against these attacks. We find that the adversarial examples crafted on transformers offer the highest transferability rate (i.e., 25.7% higher than the average) onto other models. Similarly, adversarial examples crafted on other models have the lowest rate of transferability (i.e., 56.7% lower than the average) onto transformers. Our work emphasizes the importance of studying transformer architectures for attacking and defending models in security domains, and suggests using them as the primary architecture in transfer attack settings.

However, it is often assumed that LLMs do not possess sufficient knowledge to be used for the low-level trajectories themselves. In this work, we address this assumption thoroughly, and investigate if an LLM (GPT-4) can directly predict a dense sequence of end-effector poses for manipulation skills, when given access to only object detection and segmentation vision models. We study how well a single task-agnostic prompt, without any in-context examples, motion primitives, or external trajectory optimisers, can perform across 26 real-world language-based tasks, such as \"open the bottle cap\" and \"wipe the plate with the sponge\", and we investigate which design choices in this prompt are the most effective. Our conclusions raise the assumed limit of LLMs for robotics, and we reveal for the first time that LLMs do indeed possess an understanding of low-level robot control sufficient for a range of common tasks, and that they can additionally detect failures and then re-plan trajectories accordingly.

We create a dataset that contains images with image distortions, such as lighting, specularities, shadows, and occlusion. We create perspective distortions with corresponding ground-truth homographies as labels. We use our dataset to train Swin transformer models to analyze sequential image data. The attention maps enable the model to detect relevant image content and differentiate it from outliers and artifacts. We further explore using neural feature maps as alternatives to classical key point detectors. The feature maps of trained convolutional layers provide dense image descriptors that can be used to find point correspondences between images. We utilize this to compute coarse image alignments and explore its limitations. "

        "abstract": "Structure determination is necessary to identify unknown organic molecules, such as those in natural products, forensic samples, the interstellar medium, and laboratory syntheses. Rotational spectroscopy enables structure determination by providing accurate 3D information about small organic molecules via their moments of inertia. Using these moments, Kraitchman analysis determines isotopic substitution coordinates, which are the unsigned $|x|,|y|,|z|$ coordinates of all atoms with natural isotopic abundance, including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. While unsigned substitution coordinates can verify guesses of structures, the missing $+/-$ signs make it challenging to determine the actual structure from the substitution coordinates alone. To tackle this inverse problem, we develop KREED (Kraitchman REflection-Equivariant Diffusion), a generative diffusion model that infers a molecule's complete 3D structure from its molecular formula, moments of inertia, and unsigned substitution coordinates of heavy atoms. KREED's top-1 predictions identify the correct 3D structure with >98% accuracy on the QM9 and GEOM datasets when provided with substitution coordinates of all heavy atoms with natural isotopic abundance. When substitution coordinates are restricted to only a subset of carbons, accuracy is retained at 91% on QM9 and 32% on GEOM. On a test set of experimentally measured substitution coordinates gathered from the literature, KREED predicts the correct all-atom 3D structure in 25 of 33 cases, demonstrating experimental applicability for context-free 3D structure determination with rotational spectroscopy.

In this paper, we systematically analyse the ability of LLMs to acquire novel interpretations using in-context learning. To facilitate our study, we introduce MAGNIFICo, an evaluation suite implemented within a text-to-SQL semantic parsing framework that incorporates diverse tokens and prompt settings to simulate real-world complexity. Experimental results on MAGNIFICo demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a surprisingly robust capacity for comprehending novel interpretations from natural language descriptions as well as from discussions within long conversations. Nevertheless, our findings also highlight the need for further improvements, particularly when interpreting unfamiliar words or when composing multiple novel interpretations simultaneously in the same example. Additionally, our analysis uncovers the semantic predispositions in LLMs and reveals the impact of recency bias for information presented in long contexts. "

We systematically evaluate the state-of-the-art LLMs with KGs in generic and specific domains. The experiment shows that ChatGPT is consistently the top performer across all domains.

However, in practical applications, the occurrence of short-term voltage instability following a disturbance is minimal, leading to a significant class imbalance problem and a consequent decline in classifier performance. This work proposes a Transformer-based STVSA method to address this challenge. By utilizing the basic Transformer architecture, a stability assessment Transformer (StaaT) is developed {as a classification model to reflect the correlation between the operational states of the system and the resulting stability outcomes}. To combat the negative impact of imbalanced datasets, this work employs a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP) for synthetic data generation, aiding in the creation of a balanced, representative training set for the classifier. Semi-supervised clustering learning is implemented to enhance clustering quality, addressing the lack of a unified quantitative criterion for short-term voltage stability. {Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus test system extensively demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robust performance under class imbalances up to 100:1 and noisy environments, and maintains consistent effectiveness even with an increased penetration of renewable energy}. Comparative results reveal that the CWGAN-GP generates more balanced datasets than traditional oversampling methods and that the StaaT outperforms other deep learning algorithms. This study presents a compelling solution for real-world STVSA applications that often face class imbalance and data noise challenges. "

Focusing on the unique challenge of task performance quantification in AR, we utilize egocentric video, speech, and context analysis. The integration of LLMs facilitates enhanced state estimation, marking a step towards more adaptive AR systems. Code, dataset, and demo will be available at https://github.com/nguyennm1024/misar. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11714",
        "abstract": "The evaluation of deep generative models including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has been extensively studied in the literature. While the existing evaluation methods mainly target a centralized learning problem with training data stored by a single client, many applications of generative models concern distributed learning settings, e.g. the federated learning scenario, where training data are collected by and distributed among several clients. In this paper, we study the evaluation of generative models in distributed learning tasks with heterogeneous data distributions. First, we focus on the Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID) and consider the following FID-based aggregate scores over the clients: 1) FID-avg as the mean of clients' individual FID scores, 2) FID-all as the FID distance of the trained model to the collective dataset containing all clients' data. We prove that the model rankings according to the FID-all and FID-avg scores could be inconsistent, which can lead to different optimal generative models according to the two aggregate scores. Next, we consider the kernel inception distance (KID) and similarly define the KID-avg and KID-all aggregations. Unlike the FID case, we prove that KID-all and KID-avg result in the same rankings of generative models. We perform several numerical experiments on standard image datasets and training schemes to support our theoretical findings on the evaluation of generative models in distributed learning problems. "

Notably, the output control and alignment with the input of LLMs can be refined through instruction tuning. However, as highlighted in several studies, low-quality data in the training set are usually detrimental to instruction tuning, resulting in inconsistent or even misleading LLM outputs. We propose a novel method, termed \"reflection-tuning,\" which addresses the problem by self-improvement and judging capabilities of LLMs. This approach utilizes an oracle LLM to recycle the original training data by introspecting and enhancing the quality of instructions and responses in the data. Extensive experiments on widely used evaluation benchmarks show that LLMs trained with our recycled data outperform those trained with existing datasets in various benchmarks. "

        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a technique that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose complex tasks into multi-step reasoning through intermediate steps in natural language form. Briefly, CoT enables LLMs to think step by step. However, although many Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks also require thinking step by step, LLMs perform less well than small-scale Masked Language Models (MLMs). To migrate CoT from LLMs to MLMs, we propose Chain-of-Thought Tuning (CoTT), a two-step reasoning framework based on prompt tuning, to implement step-by-step thinking for MLMs on NLU tasks. From the perspective of CoT, CoTT's two-step framework enables MLMs to implement task decomposition; CoTT's prompt tuning allows intermediate steps to be used in natural language form. Thereby, the success of CoT can be extended to NLU tasks through MLMs. To verify the effectiveness of CoTT, we conduct experiments on two NLU tasks: hierarchical classification and relation extraction, and the results show that CoTT outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Recent studies primarily focused on the quality of LLMs evaluated by GPT-4 or their ability to pass medical exams, no studies have quantified the extent of health-related atomic knowledge stored in LLMs' memory, which is the basis of LLMs to provide more factual suggestions. In this paper, we first constructed a benchmark, including the most common types of atomic knowledge in user self-diagnosis queries, with 17 atomic types and a total of 14, 048 pieces of atomic knowledge. Then, we evaluated both generic and specialized LLMs on the benchmark. The experimental results showcased that generic LLMs perform better than specialized LLMs in terms of atomic knowledge and instruction-following ability. Error analysis revealed that both generic and specialized LLMs are sycophantic, e.g., always catering to users' claims when it comes to unknown knowledge. Besides, generic LLMs showed stronger safety, which can be learned by specialized LLMs through distilled data. We further explored different types of data commonly adopted for fine-tuning specialized LLMs, i.e., real-world, semi-distilled, and distilled data, and found that distilled data can benefit LLMs most.

        "abstract": "While previous CNN-based models have exhibited promising results for salient object detection (SOD), their ability to explore global long-range dependencies is restricted. Our previous work, the Visual Saliency Transformer (VST), addressed this constraint from a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence perspective, to unify RGB and RGB-D SOD. In VST, we developed a multi-task transformer decoder that concurrently predicts saliency and boundary outcomes in a pure transformer architecture. Moreover, we introduced a novel token upsampling method called reverse T2T for predicting a high-resolution saliency map effortlessly within transformer-based structures. Building upon the VST model, we further propose an efficient and stronger VST version in this work, i.e. VST++. To mitigate the computational costs of the VST model, we propose a Select-Integrate Attention (SIA) module, partitioning foreground into fine-grained segments and aggregating background information into a single coarse-grained token. To incorporate 3D depth information with low cost, we design a novel depth position encoding method tailored for depth maps. Furthermore, we introduce a token-supervised prediction loss to provide straightforward guidance for the task-related tokens. We evaluate our VST++ model across various transformer-based backbones on RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods while achieving a 25% reduction in computational costs without significant performance compromise.

        "abstract": "The offline reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm provides a general recipe to convert static behavior datasets into policies that can perform better than the policy that collected the data. While policy constraints, conservatism, and other methods for mitigating distributional shifts have made offline reinforcement learning more effective, the continuous action setting often necessitates various approximations for applying these techniques. Many of these challenges are greatly alleviated in discrete action settings, where offline RL constraints and regularizers can often be computed more precisely or even exactly. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheme for action quantization. We use a VQ-VAE to learn state-conditioned action quantization, avoiding the exponential blowup that comes with na\\\"ive discretization of the action space. We show that several state-of-the-art offline RL methods such as IQL, CQL, and BRAC improve in performance on benchmarks when combined with our proposed discretization scheme. We further validate our approach on a set of challenging long-horizon complex robotic manipulation tasks in the Robomimic environment, where our discretized offline RL algorithms are able to improve upon their continuous counterparts by 2-3x.

However, recent disputes over GPT-4's law evaluation raise questions concerning their performance in real-world legal tasks. To systematically investigate their competency in the law, we design practical baseline solutions based on LLMs and test on the task of legal judgment prediction. In our solutions, LLMs can work alone to answer open questions or coordinate with an information retrieval (IR) system to learn from similar cases or solve simplified multi-choice questions. We show that similar cases and multi-choice options, namely label candidates, included in prompts can help LLMs recall domain knowledge that is critical for expertise legal reasoning. We additionally present an intriguing paradox wherein an IR system surpasses the performance of LLM+IR due to limited gains acquired by weaker LLMs from powerful IR systems. In such cases, the role of LLMs becomes redundant. Our evaluation pipeline can be easily extended into other tasks to facilitate evaluations in other domains.

        "abstract": "The recent surge in the research of diffusion models has accelerated the adoption of text-to-image models in various Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) commercial products. While these exceptional AIGC products are gaining increasing recognition and sparking enthusiasm among consumers, the questions regarding whether, when, and how these models might unintentionally reinforce existing societal stereotypes remain largely unaddressed. Motivated by recent advancements in language agents, here we introduce a novel agent architecture tailored for stereotype detection in text-to-image models. This versatile agent architecture is capable of accommodating free-form detection tasks and can autonomously invoke various tools to facilitate the entire process, from generating corresponding instructions and images, to detecting stereotypes. We build the stereotype-relevant benchmark based on multiple open-text datasets, and apply this architecture to commercial products and popular open source text-to-image models. We find that these models often display serious stereotypes when it comes to certain prompts about personal characteristics, social cultural context and crime-related aspects. In summary, these empirical findings underscore the pervasive existence of stereotypes across social dimensions, including gender, race, and religion, which not only validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, but also emphasize the critical necessity of addressing potential ethical risks in the burgeoning realm of AIGC. As AIGC continues its rapid expansion trajectory, with new models and plugins emerging daily in staggering numbers, the challenge lies in the timely detection and mitigation of potential biases within these models.

In this work, we propose a general framework named Progressive3D, which decomposes the entire generation into a series of locally progressive editing steps to create precise 3D content for complex prompts, and we constrain the content change to only occur in regions determined by user-defined region prompts in each editing step. Furthermore, we propose an overlapped semantic component suppression technique to encourage the optimization process to focus more on the semantic differences between prompts.

        "abstract": "Innovations like protein diffusion have enabled significant progress in de novo protein design, which is a vital topic in life science. These methods typically depend on protein structure encoders to model residue backbone frames, where atoms do not exist. Most prior encoders rely on atom-wise features, such as angles and distances between atoms, which are not available in this context. Thus far, only several simple encoders, such as IPA, have been proposed for this scenario, exposing the frame modeling as a bottleneck. In this work, we proffer the Vector Field Network (VFN), which enables network layers to perform learnable vector computations between coordinates of frame-anchored virtual atoms, thus achieving a higher capability for modeling frames. The vector computation operates in a manner similar to a linear layer, with each input channel receiving 3D virtual atom coordinates instead of scalar values. The multiple feature vectors output by the vector computation are then used to update the residue representations and virtual atom coordinates via attention aggregation. Remarkably, VFN also excels in modeling both frames and atoms, as the real atoms can be treated as the virtual atoms for modeling, positioning VFN as a potential universal encoder. In protein diffusion (frame modeling), VFN exhibits an impressive performance advantage over IPA, excelling in terms of both designability (67.04% vs. 53.58%) and diversity (66.54% vs. 51.98%). In inverse folding (frame and atom modeling), VFN outperforms the previous SoTA model, PiFold (54.7% vs. 51.66%), on sequence recovery rate. We also propose a method of equipping VFN with the ESM model, which significantly surpasses the previous ESM-based SoTA (62.67% vs. 55.65%), LM-Design, by a substantial margin. "

However, extending this capability to multi-agent scenarios presents challenges. Most current works struggle with zero-shot capabilities, due to two challenges particular to the multi-agent settings: a mismatch between centralized pretraining and decentralized execution, and varying agent numbers and action spaces, making it difficult to create generalizable representations across diverse downstream tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a \\textbf{Mask}ed pretraining framework for \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{a}gent decision making (MaskMA). This model, based on transformer architecture, employs a mask-based collaborative learning strategy suited for decentralized execution with partial observation. Moreover, MaskMA integrates a generalizable action representation by dividing the action space into actions toward self-information and actions related to other entities. This flexibility allows MaskMA to tackle tasks with varying agent numbers and thus different action spaces. Extensive experiments in SMAC reveal MaskMA, with a single model pretrained on 11 training maps, can achieve an impressive 77.8% zero-shot win rate on 60 unseen test maps by decentralized execution, while also performing effectively on other types of downstream tasks (\\textit{e.g.,} varied policies collaboration and ad hoc team play).

Conventional neural reflectance fields use only continuous representations to model 3D scenes, despite the fact that objects are typically composed of discrete materials in reality. This lack of discretization can result in noisy material decomposition and complicated material editing. To address these limitations, our model consists of a continuous branch and a discrete branch. The continuous branch follows the conventional pipeline to predict decomposed materials, while the discrete branch uses the VQ mechanism to quantize continuous materials into individual ones. By discretizing the materials, our model can reduce noise in the decomposition process and generate a segmentation map of discrete materials. Specific materials can be easily selected for further editing by clicking on the corresponding area of the segmentation outcomes. Additionally, we propose a dropout-based VQ codeword ranking strategy to predict the number of materials in a scene, which reduces redundancy in the material segmentation process. To improve usability, we also develop an interactive interface to further assist material editing. We evaluate our model on both computer-generated and real-world scenes, demonstrating its superior performance. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to enable discrete material editing in 3D scenes. "

Specifically, we evaluate OpenAI's CLIP and OpenCLIP models for key applications, such as zero-shot classification, image retrieval and image captioning. We categorize desired behaviors based around three axes: (i) if the task concerns humans; (ii) how subjective the task is (i.e., how likely it is that people from a diverse range of backgrounds would agree on a labeling); and (iii) the intended purpose of the task and if fairness is better served by impartiality (i.e., making decisions independent of the protected attributes) or representation (i.e., making decisions to maximize diversity). Finally, we provide quantitative fairness evaluations for both binary-valued and multi-valued protected attributes over ten diverse datasets. We find that fair PCA, a post-processing method for fair representations, works very well for debiasing in most of the aforementioned tasks while incurring only minor loss of performance. However, different debiasing approaches vary in their effectiveness depending on the task. Hence, one should choose the debiasing approach depending on the specific use case. "

However, these models also introduce potential safety hazards, such as the production of harmful content and infringement of data copyrights. Although there have been efforts to create safety-driven unlearning methods to counteract these challenges, doubts remain about their capabilities. To bridge this uncertainty, we propose an evaluation framework built upon adversarial attacks (also referred to as adversarial prompts), in order to discern the trustworthiness of these safety-driven unlearned DMs. Specifically, our research explores the (worst-case) robustness of unlearned DMs in eradicating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects, assessed by the generation of adversarial prompts. We develop a novel adversarial learning approach called UnlearnDiff that leverages the inherent classification capabilities of DMs to streamline the generation of adversarial prompts, making it as simple for DMs as it is for image classification attacks. This technique streamlines the creation of adversarial prompts, making the process as intuitive for generative modeling as it is for image classification assaults. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we assess the unlearning robustness of five prevalent unlearned DMs across multiple tasks. Our results underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of UnlearnDiff when compared to state-of-the-art adversarial prompting methods.

Image resampling transforms a discrete image into a new one, simulating the process of scene recapturing or rerendering as specified by a geometrical transformation. The underlying rationale behind our idea is that image resampling can alleviate the influence of adversarial perturbations while preserving essential semantic information, thereby conferring an inherent advantage in defending against adversarial attacks. To validate this concept, we present a comprehensive study on leveraging image resampling to defend against adversarial attacks. We have developed basic resampling methods that employ interpolation strategies and coordinate shifting magnitudes. Our analysis reveals that these basic methods can partially mitigate adversarial attacks. However, they come with apparent limitations: the accuracy of clean images noticeably decreases, while the improvement in accuracy on adversarial examples is not substantial. We propose implicit representation-driven image resampling (IRAD) to overcome these limitations. First, we construct an implicit continuous representation that enables us to represent any input image within a continuous coordinate space. Second, we introduce SampleNet, which automatically generates pixel-wise shifts for resampling in response to different inputs. Furthermore, we can extend our approach to the state-of-the-art diffusion-based method, accelerating it with fewer time steps while preserving its defense capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of diverse deep models against various attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean images. "

        "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many areas. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to the input length hinders the applicability of Transformer-based models to long sequences. To address this, we present Fast Multipole Attention, a new attention mechanism that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the time and memory complexity of attention for sequences of length $n$ from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ or $O(n)$, while retaining a global receptive field. The hierarchical approach groups queries, keys, and values into $\\mathcal{O}( \\log n)$ levels of resolution, where groups at greater distances are increasingly larger in size and the weights to compute group quantities are learned. As such, the interaction between tokens far from each other is considered in lower resolution in an efficient hierarchical manner. The overall complexity of Fast Multipole Attention is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$, depending on whether the queries are down-sampled or not. This multi-level divide-and-conquer strategy is inspired by fast summation methods from $n$-body physics and the Fast Multipole Method. We perform evaluation on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling tasks and compare our Fast Multipole Attention model with other efficient attention variants on medium-size datasets. We find empirically that the Fast Multipole Transformer performs much better than other efficient transformers in terms of memory size and accuracy. The Fast Multipole Attention mechanism has the potential to empower large language models with much greater sequence lengths, taking the full context into account in an efficient, naturally hierarchical manner during training and when generating long sequences.

However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options. Experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data. "

        "abstract": "The success of AI assistants based on language models (LLMs) hinges crucially on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which enables the generation of responses more aligned with human preferences. As universal AI assistants, there's a growing expectation for them to perform consistently across various domains. However, previous work shows that Reinforcement Learning (RL) often exploits shortcuts to attain high rewards and overlooks challenging samples. This focus on quick reward gains undermines both the stability in training and the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can learn a consistent policy via RL across various data groups or domains. Given the challenges associated with acquiring group annotations, our method automatically classifies data into different groups, deliberately maximizing performance variance. Then, we optimize the policy to perform well on challenging groups. Lastly, leveraging the established groups, our approach adaptively adjusts the exploration space, allocating more learning capacity to more challenging data and preventing the model from over-optimizing on simpler data. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly enhances training stability and model generalization. "

We show that transformer models are able to generalize to long lengths with the help of targeted attention biasing.

        "abstract": "The recent use of diffusion prior, enhanced by pre-trained text-image models, has markedly elevated the performance of image super-resolution (SR). To alleviate the huge computational cost required by pixel-based diffusion SR, latent-based methods utilize a feature encoder to transform the image and then implement the SR image generation in a compact latent space. Nevertheless, there are two major issues that limit the performance of latent-based diffusion. First, the compression of latent space usually causes reconstruction distortion. Second, huge computational cost constrains the parameter scale of the diffusion model. To counteract these issues, we first propose a frequency compensation module that enhances the frequency components from latent space to pixel space. The reconstruction distortion (especially for high-frequency information) can be significantly decreased. Then, we propose to use Sample-Space Mixture of Experts (SS-MoE) to achieve more powerful latent-based SR, which steadily improves the capacity of the model without a significant increase in inference costs. These carefully crafted designs contribute to performance improvements in largely explored 4x blind super-resolution benchmarks and extend to large magnification factors, i.e., 8x image SR benchmarks.

Particularly, the strong reasoning capabilities of LLMs make it possible for robots to perform long-horizon tasks without expensive annotated demonstrations. However, public benchmarks for testing the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of language-conditioned robots in various scenarios are still missing. To fill this gap, this work focuses on the tabletop manipulation task and releases a simulation benchmark, \\textit{LoHoRavens}, which covers various long-horizon reasoning aspects spanning color, size, space, arithmetics and reference. Furthermore, there is a key modality bridging problem for long-horizon manipulation tasks with LLMs: how to incorporate the observation feedback during robot execution for the LLM's closed-loop planning, which is however less studied by prior work. We investigate two methods of bridging the modality gap: caption generation and learnable interface for incorporating explicit and implicit observation feedback to the LLM, respectively. These methods serve as the two baselines for our proposed benchmark. Experiments show that both methods struggle to solve some tasks, indicating long-horizon manipulation tasks are still challenging for current popular models. We expect the proposed public benchmark and baselines can help the community develop better models for long-horizon tabletop manipulation tasks. "

We develop a text scaling method that leverages the pattern recognition capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose concept-guided chain-of-thought (CGCoT), which uses prompts designed to summarize ideas and identify target parties in texts to generate concept-specific breakdowns, in many ways similar to guidance for human coder content analysis. CGCoT effectively shifts pairwise text comparisons from a reasoning problem to a pattern recognition problem. We then pairwise compare concept-specific breakdowns using an LLM. We use the results of these pairwise comparisons to estimate a scale using the Bradley-Terry model. We use this approach to scale affective speech on Twitter. Our measures correlate more strongly with human judgments than alternative approaches like Wordfish. Besides a small set of pilot data to develop the CGCoT prompts, our measures require no additional labeled data and produce binary predictions comparable to a RoBERTa-Large model fine-tuned on thousands of human-labeled tweets. We demonstrate how combining substantive knowledge with LLMs can create state-of-the-art measures of abstract concepts. "

First, we test on WEBEmo and compare the CLIP-E architectures with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and with CLIP Zero-Shot. Second, we perform cross dataset evaluation, and test the CLIP-E architectures trained with WEBEmo on other Visual Sentiment Analysis benchmarks.

Interestingly, we observed that for the FI dataset, CLIP Zero-Shot produces better accuracies than SOTA models and CLIP-E trained on WEBEmo. These results motivate several questions that we discuss in this paper, such as how we should design new benchmarks and evaluate Visual Sentiment Analysis, and whether we should keep designing tailored Deep Learning models for Visual Sentiment Analysis or focus our efforts on better using the knowledge encoded in large vision-language models such as CLIP for this task.

In this paper we study whether given access to a trained GAN, as well as fresh samples from the underlying distribution, if it is possible for an attacker to efficiently identify if a given point is a member of the GAN's training data. This is of interest for both reasons related to copyright, where a user may want to determine if their copyrighted data has been used to train a GAN, and in the study of data privacy, where the ability to detect training set membership is known as a membership inference attack. Unlike the majority of prior work this paper investigates the privacy implications of using GANs in black-box settings, where the attack only has access to samples from the generator, rather than access to the discriminator as well. We introduce a suite of membership inference attacks against GANs in the black-box setting and evaluate our attacks on image GANs trained on the CIFAR10 dataset and tabular GANs trained on genomic data. Our most successful attack, called The Detector, involve training a second network to score samples based on their likelihood of being generated by the GAN, as opposed to a fresh sample from the distribution. We prove under a simple model of the generator that the detector is an approximately optimal membership inference attack. Across a wide range of tabular and image datasets, attacks, and GAN architectures, we find that adversaries can orchestrate non-trivial privacy attacks when provided with access to samples from the generator. At the same time, the attack success achievable against GANs still appears to be lower compared to other generative and discriminative models; this leaves the intriguing open question of whether GANs are in fact more private, or if it is a matter of developing stronger attacks.

Nevertheless, their application in real-time scenarios has been highly restricted due to the significant inference latency associated with these models. This is particularly pronounced due to the autoregressive nature of generative LLM inference, where tokens are generated sequentially since each token depends on all previous output tokens. It is therefore challenging to achieve any token-level parallelism, making inference extremely memory-bound. In this work, we propose SPEED, which improves inference efficiency by speculatively executing multiple future tokens in parallel with the current token using predicted values based on early-layer hidden states. For Transformer decoders that employ parameter sharing, the memory operations for the tokens executing in parallel can be amortized, which allows us to accelerate generative LLM inference. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in terms of latency reduction relative to model accuracy and demonstrate how speculation allows for training deeper decoders with parameter sharing with minimal runtime overhead.

Since visual transformers are recently being widely used in most image classification based tasks due to their capability to produce high accuracies, this study tries to explore bias in the transformer based image forensic algorithms that classify natural and GAN generated images. By procuring a bias evaluation corpora, this study analyzes bias in gender, racial, affective, and intersectional domains using a wide set of individual and pairwise bias evaluation measures. As the generalizability of the algorithms against image compression is an important factor to be considered in forensic tasks, this study also analyzes the role of image compression on model bias. Hence to study the impact of image compression on model bias, a two phase evaluation setting is followed, where a set of experiments is carried out in the uncompressed evaluation setting and the other in the compressed evaluation setting.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.

A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains information using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g., a dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows, connection lines, etc.). Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at diagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when many objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines and also often fail to render comprehensible text labels. To address this gap, we present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation framework that leverages the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to generate more accurate open-domain, open-platform diagrams. In the first stage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine 'diagram plans' (in a planner-auditor feedback loop) which describe all the entities (objects and text labels), their relationships (arrows or lines), and their bounding box layouts. In the second stage, we use a diagram generator, DiagramGLIGEN, and a text label rendering module to generate diagrams following the diagram plans. To benchmark the text-to-diagram generation task, we introduce AI2D-Caption, a densely annotated diagram dataset built on top of the AI2D dataset. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that our DiagrammerGPT framework produces more accurate diagrams, outperforming existing T2I models. We also provide comprehensive analysis including open-domain diagram generation, vector graphic diagram generation in different platforms, human-in-the-loop diagram plan editing, and multimodal planner/auditor LLMs (e.g., GPT-4Vision).

        "abstract": "Making models algorithmically fairer in tabular data has been long studied, with techniques typically oriented towards fixes which usually take a neural model with an undesirable outcome and make changes to how the data are ingested, what the model weights are, or how outputs are processed. We employ an emergent and different strategy where we consider updating the model's architecture and training hyperparameters to find an entirely new model with better outcomes from the beginning of the debiasing procedure. In this work, we propose using multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) in the first application to the very challenging domain of tabular data. We conduct extensive exploration of architectural and hyperparameter spaces (MLP, ResNet, and FT-Transformer) across diverse datasets, demonstrating the dependence of accuracy and fairness metrics of model predictions on hyperparameter combinations. We show that models optimized solely for accuracy with NAS often fail to inherently address fairness concerns. We propose a novel approach that jointly optimizes architectural and training hyperparameters in a multi-objective constraint of both accuracy and fairness. We produce architectures that consistently Pareto dominate state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods either in fairness, accuracy or both, all of this while being Pareto-optimal over hyperparameters achieved through single-objective (accuracy) optimization runs. This research underscores the promise of automating fairness and accuracy optimization in deep learning models. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11458",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly important role in science and engineering. For example, their ability to parse and understand human and computer languages makes them powerful interpreters and their use in applications like code generation are well-documented. We explore the ability of the GPT-4 LLM to ameliorate two major challenges in computational materials science: i) the high barriers for adoption of scientific software associated with the use of custom input languages, and ii) the poor reproducibility of published results due to insufficient details in the description of simulation methods. We focus on a widely used software for molecular dynamics simulations, the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS), and quantify the usefulness of input files generated by GPT-4 from task descriptions in English and its ability to generate detailed descriptions of computational tasks from input files. We find that GPT-4 can generate correct and ready-to-use input files for relatively simple tasks and useful starting points for more complex, multi-step simulations. In addition, GPT-4's description of computational tasks from input files can be tuned from a detailed set of step-by-step instructions to a summary description appropriate for publications. Our results show that GPT-4 can reduce the number of routine tasks performed by researchers, accelerate the training of new users, and enhance reproducibility. "

        "title": "Equivariant Bootstrapping for Uncertainty Quantification in Imaging  Inverse Problems",
        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11838",
        "abstract": "Scientific imaging problems are often severely ill-posed, and hence have significant intrinsic uncertainty. Accurately quantifying the uncertainty in the solutions to such problems is therefore critical for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results as well as for reliably using the reconstructed images as scientific evidence. Unfortunately, existing imaging methods are unable to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructed images in a manner that is robust to experiment replications. This paper presents a new uncertainty quantification methodology based on an equivariant formulation of the parametric bootstrap algorithm that leverages symmetries and invariance properties commonly encountered in imaging problems. Additionally, the proposed methodology is general and can be easily applied with any image reconstruction technique, including unsupervised training strategies that can be trained from observed data alone, thus enabling uncertainty quantification in situations where there is no ground truth data available. We demonstrate the proposed approach with a series of numerical experiments and through comparisons with alternative uncertainty quantification strategies from the state-of-the-art, such as Bayesian strategies involving score-based diffusion models and Langevin samplers. In all our experiments, the proposed method delivers remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms the competing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11940",
        "abstract": "The best encoding is the one that is interpretable in nature. In this work, we introduce a novel model that incorporates an interpretable bottleneck-termed the Filter Bank (FB)-at the outset of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This arrangement compels the VAE to attend on the most informative segments of the input signal, fostering the learning of a novel encoding ${f_0}$ which boasts enhanced interpretability and clusterability over traditional latent spaces. By deliberately constraining the VAE with this FB, we intentionally constrict its capacity to access broad input domain information, promoting the development of an encoding that is discernible, separable, and of reduced dimensionality. The evolutionary learning trajectory of ${f_0}$ further manifests as a dynamic hierarchical tree, offering profound insights into cluster similarities. Additionally, for handling intricate data configurations, we propose a tailored decoder structure that is symmetrically aligned with FB's architecture. Empirical evaluations highlight the superior efficacy of ISVAE, which compares favorably to state-of-the-art results in clustering metrics across real-world datasets. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12029",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an inverse space-dependent source problem for a time-fractional diffusion equation. To deal with the ill-posedness of the problem, we transform the problem into an optimal control problem with total variational (TV) regularization. In contrast to the classical Tikhonov model incorporating $L^2$ penalty terms, the inclusion of a TV term proves advantageous in reconstructing solutions that exhibit discontinuities or piecewise constancy. The control problem is approximated by a fully discrete scheme, and convergence results are provided within this framework. Furthermore, a lineraed primal-dual iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the discrete control model based on an equivalent saddle-point reformulation, and several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm.
