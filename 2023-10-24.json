        "abstract": "When generating insights from human groups, conversational deliberation is a key method for exploring issues, surfacing ideas, debating options, and converging on solutions. Unfortunately, real-time conversations are difficult to scale, losing effectiveness in groups above 4 to 7 members. Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is a new technology that enables large human groups to hold real-time conversations using techniques modeled on the dynamics of biological swarms. Through a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs), CSI enables real-time dialog among small groups while simultaneously fostering content propagation across a much larger group. This combines the benefits of small-scale deliberative reasoning and large-scale groupwise intelligence. In this study, we engage a group of 81 American voters from one political party in real-time deliberation using a CSI platform called Thinkscape. We then task the group with (a) forecasting which candidate from a set of options will achieve the most national support, and (b) indicating the specific reasons for this result. After only six minutes of deliberation, the group of 81 individuals converged on a selected candidate and surfaced over 400 reasons justifying various candidates, including 206 justifications that supported the selected candidate. We find that the selected candidate was significantly more supported by group members than the other options (p<0.001) and that this effect held even after six minutes of deliberation, demonstrating that CSI provides both the qualitative benefits of conversational focus groups and the quantitative benefits of largescale polling.

        "abstract": "Gestures perform a variety of communicative functions that powerfully influence human face-to-face interaction. How this communicative function is achieved varies greatly between individuals and depends on the role of the speaker and the context of the interaction. Approaches to automatic gesture generation vary not only in the degree to which they rely on data-driven techniques but also the degree to which they can produce context and speaker specific gestures. However, these approaches face two major challenges: The first is obtaining sufficient training data that is appropriate for the context and the goal of the application. The second is related to designer control to realize their specific intent for the application. Here, we approach these challenges by using large language models (LLMs) to show that these powerful models of large amounts of data can be adapted for gesture analysis and generation. Specifically, we used ChatGPT as a tool for suggesting context-specific gestures that can realize designer intent based on minimal prompts. We also find that ChatGPT can suggests novel yet appropriate gestures not present in the minimal training data. The use of LLMs is a promising avenue for gesture generation that reduce the need for laborious annotations and has the potential to flexibly and quickly adapt to different designer intents. "

We conducted a formative study in an undergraduate computer science classroom (N=145) and a controlled experiment on Prolific (N=356) to explore the impact of four pedagogically informed guidance strategies and the interaction between student approaches and LLM responses. Direct LLM answers marginally improved performance, while refining student solutions fostered trust.

        "abstract": "Text-to-Image Diffusion Models such as Stable-Diffusion and Imagen have achieved unprecedented quality of photorealism with state-of-the-art FID scores on MS-COCO and other generation benchmarks. Given a caption, image generation requires fine-grained knowledge about attributes such as object structure, style, and viewpoint amongst others. Where does this information reside in text-to-image generative models? In our paper, we tackle this question and understand how knowledge corresponding to distinct visual attributes is stored in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. We adapt Causal Mediation Analysis for text-to-image models and trace knowledge about distinct visual attributes to various (causal) components in the (i) UNet and (ii) text-encoder of the diffusion model. In particular, we show that unlike generative large-language models, knowledge about different attributes is not localized in isolated components, but is instead distributed amongst a set of components in the conditional UNet. These sets of components are often distinct for different visual attributes. Remarkably, we find that the CLIP text-encoder in public text-to-image models such as Stable-Diffusion contains only one causal state across different visual attributes, and this is the first self-attention layer corresponding to the last subject token of the attribute in the caption. This is in stark contrast to the causal states in other language models which are often the mid-MLP layers. Based on this observation of only one causal state in the text-encoder, we introduce a fast, data-free model editing method Diff-QuickFix which can effectively edit concepts in text-to-image models. DiffQuickFix can edit (ablate) concepts in under a second with a closed-form update, providing a significant 1000x speedup and comparable editing performance to existing fine-tuning based editing methods.

Recent advances in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation allow for accurate estimation of local scene appearance and in turn, can benefit the relocalization of the vehicle. However, one downside of BEV methods is the heavy computation required to leverage the geometric constraints. This paper presents U-BEV, a U-Net inspired architecture that extends the current state-of-the-art by allowing the BEV to reason about the scene on multiple height layers before flattening the BEV features. We show that this extension boosts the performance of the U-BEV by up to 4.11 IoU. Additionally, we combine the encoded neural BEV with a differentiable template matcher to perform relocalization on neural SD-map data. The model is fully end-to-end trainable and outperforms transformer-based BEV methods of similar computational complexity by 1.7 to 2.8 mIoU and BEV-based relocalization by over 26% Recall Accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.

In contrast to recent works that leverage 2D text-to-image diffusion models to distill 3D objects using a slow and fragile optimization process, TexFusion introduces a new 3D-consistent generation technique specifically designed for texture synthesis that employs regular diffusion model sampling on different 2D rendered views. Specifically, we leverage latent diffusion models, apply the diffusion model's denoiser on a set of 2D renders of the 3D object, and aggregate the different denoising predictions on a shared latent texture map. Final output RGB textures are produced by optimizing an intermediate neural color field on the decodings of 2D renders of the latent texture. We thoroughly validate TexFusion and show that we can efficiently generate diverse, high quality and globally coherent textures. We achieve state-of-the-art text-guided texture synthesis performance using only image diffusion models, while avoiding the pitfalls of previous distillation-based methods. The text-conditioning offers detailed control and we also do not rely on any ground truth 3D textures for training. This makes our method versatile and applicable to a broad range of geometry and texture types. We hope that TexFusion will advance AI-based texturing of 3D assets for applications in virtual reality, game design, simulation, and more. "

We also explore the potential of the recently released GPT-4 to act as an evaluator. We find that ChatGPT consistently outperforms many other popular models according to human reviewers on the majority of metrics, while scoring much more poorly when using classic automatic evaluation metrics. We also find that human reviewers rate the gold reference as much worse than the best models' outputs, indicating the poor quality of many popular benchmarks.

Our inner loop turns out to be equivalent to linear attention when the inner-loop learner is only a linear model, and to self-attention when it is a kernel estimator. For practical comparison with linear or self-attention layers, we replace each of them in a transformer with an inner loop, so our outer loop is equivalent to training the architecture. When each inner-loop learner is a neural network, our approach vastly outperforms transformers with linear attention on ImageNet from 224 x 224 raw pixels in both accuracy and FLOPs, while (regular) transformers cannot run.

        "abstract": "Sequential tabular data is one of the most commonly used data types in real-world applications. Different from conventional tabular data, where rows in a table are independent, sequential tabular data contains rich contextual and sequential information, where some fields are dynamically changing over time and others are static. Existing transformer-based approaches analyzing sequential tabular data overlook the differences between dynamic and static fields by replicating and filling static fields into each transformer, and ignore temporal information between rows, which leads to three major disadvantages: (1) computational overhead, (2) artificially simplified data for masked language modeling pre-training task that may yield less meaningful representations, and (3) disregarding the temporal behavioral patterns implied by time intervals. In this work, we propose FATA-Trans, a model with two field transformers for modeling sequential tabular data, where each processes static and dynamic field information separately. FATA-Trans is field- and time-aware for sequential tabular data. The field-type embedding in the method enables FATA-Trans to capture differences between static and dynamic fields. The time-aware position embedding exploits both order and time interval information between rows, which helps the model detect underlying temporal behavior in a sequence. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the learned representations from FATA-Trans consistently outperform state-of-the-art solutions in the downstream tasks. We also present visualization studies to highlight the insights captured by the learned representations, enhancing our understanding of the underlying data.

Within such safety-critical application areas, the complexity of the emerging trajectory optimization problems has motivated the application of AI-based techniques to enhance the performance of traditional approaches. However, current AI-based methods either attempt to fully replace traditional control algorithms, thus lacking constraint satisfaction guarantees and incurring in expensive simulation, or aim to solely imitate the behavior of traditional methods via supervised learning. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) and assesses the capability of modern generative models to solve complex trajectory optimization problems, both from a forecasting and control standpoint. Specifically, this work assesses the capabilities of Transformers to (i) learn near-optimal policies from previously collected data, and (ii) warm-start a sequential optimizer for the solution of non-convex optimal control problems, thus guaranteeing hard constraint satisfaction. From a forecasting perspective, results highlight how ART outperforms other learning-based architectures at predicting known fuel-optimal trajectories. From a control perspective, empirical analyses show how policies learned through Transformers are able to generate near-optimal warm-starts, achieving trajectories that are (i) more fuel-efficient, (ii) obtained in fewer sequential optimizer iterations, and (iii) computed with an overall runtime comparable to benchmarks based on convex optimization.

Recent developments in diffusion models have shown promise in merely graph structure generation or the generation of small molecular graphs with attributes. However, their applicability to large attributed graphs remains unaddressed due to challenges in capturing intricate patterns and scalability. This paper introduces GraphMaker, a novel diffusion model tailored for generating large attributed graphs. We study the diffusion models that either couple or decouple graph structure and node attribute generation to address their complex correlation. We also employ node-level conditioning and adopt a minibatch strategy for scalability. We further propose a new evaluation pipeline using models trained on generated synthetic graphs and tested on original graphs to evaluate the quality of synthetic data. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets showcase GraphMaker's superiority in generating realistic and diverse large-attributed graphs beneficial for downstream tasks. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in natural language processing. These models rely on proper human instructions (or prompts) to generate suitable responses. However, the potential of LLMs are not fully harnessed by commonly-used prompting methods: many human-in-the-loop algorithms employ ad-hoc procedures for prompt selection; while auto prompt generation approaches are essentially searching all possible prompts randomly and inefficiently. We propose Evoke, an automatic prompt refinement framework. In Evoke, there are two instances of a same LLM: one as a reviewer (LLM-Reviewer), it scores the current prompt; the other as an author (LLM-Author), it edits the prompt by considering the edit history and the reviewer's feedback. Such an author-reviewer feedback loop ensures that the prompt is refined in each iteration. We further aggregate a data selection approach to Evoke, where only the hard samples are exposed to the LLM. The hard samples are more important because the LLM can develop deeper understanding of the tasks out of them, while the model may already know how to solve the easier cases. Experimental results show that Evoke significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, in the challenging task of logical fallacy detection, Evoke scores above 80, while all other baseline methods struggle to reach 20. "

Many LLM encoders have shown high performance in EP tests, leading to conjectures about their ability to encode linguistic knowledge. However, a large body of research claims that the tests necessarily do not measure the LLM's capacity to encode knowledge, but rather reflect the classifiers' ability to learn the problem. Much of this criticism stems from the fact that often the classifiers have very similar accuracy when an LLM vs a random encoder is used. Consequently, several modifications to the tests have been suggested, including information theoretic probes. We show that commonly used edge probing test datasets have various biases including memorization. When these biases are removed, the LLM encoders do show a significant difference from the random ones, even with the simple non-information theoretic probes. "

To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal transformer exploring multi-source remote sensing data for object detection. Instead of directly combining the multimodal input through a channel-wise concatenation, which ignores the heterogeneity of different modalities, we propose a cross-channel attention module. This module learns the relationship between different channels, enabling the construction of a coherent multimodal input by aligning the different modalities at the early stage. We also introduce a new architecture based on the Swin transformer that incorporates convolution layers in non-shifting blocks while maintaining fixed dimensions, allowing for the generation of fine-to-coarse representations with a favorable accuracy-computation trade-off. The extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal fusion module and architecture, demonstrating their applicability to multimodal aerial imagery. "

However, many powerful imitation techniques do not prioritize the feasibility of the robot behaviors they generate. In this work, we explore the feasibility of plans produced by LfD. As in prior work, we employ a temporal diffusion model with fixed start and goal states to facilitate imitation through in-painting. Unlike previous studies, we apply cold diffusion to ensure the optimization process is directed through the agent's replay buffer of previously visited states. This routing approach increases the likelihood that the final trajectories will predominantly occupy the feasible region of the robot's state space. We test this method in simulated robotic environments with obstacles and observe a significant improvement in the agent's ability to avoid these obstacles during planning. "

        "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation (SR) has received increasing attention due to its ability to capture user dynamic preferences. Recently, Contrastive Learning (CL) provides an effective approach for sequential recommendation by learning invariance from different views of an input. However, most existing data or model augmentation methods may destroy semantic sequential interaction characteristics and often rely on the hand-crafted property of their contrastive view-generation strategies. In this paper, we propose a Meta-optimized Seq2Seq Generator and Contrastive Learning (Meta-SGCL) for sequential recommendation, which applies the meta-optimized two-step training strategy to adaptive generate contrastive views. Specifically, Meta-SGCL first introduces a simple yet effective augmentation method called Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) generator, which treats the Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) as the view generator and can constitute contrastive views while preserving the original sequence's semantics. Next, the model employs a meta-optimized two-step training strategy, which aims to adaptively generate contrastive views without relying on manually designed view-generation techniques. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method Meta-SGCL using three public real-world datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and the code is available. "

Inspired by the global paradigm shift in NLP towards Large Language Models (LLMs), we examine the potential of the latest generation of LLMs for the development of bilingual lexicons. We ask the following research question: Is it possible to prompt and fine-tune multilingual LLMs (mLLMs) for BLI, and how does this approach compare against and complement current BLI approaches? To this end, we systematically study 1) zero-shot prompting for unsupervised BLI and 2) few-shot in-context prompting with a set of seed translation pairs, both without any LLM fine-tuning, as well as 3) standard BLI-oriented fine-tuning of smaller LLMs. We experiment with 18 open-source text-to-text mLLMs of different sizes (from 0.3B to 13B parameters) on two standard BLI benchmarks covering a range of typologically diverse languages. Our work is the first to demonstrate strong BLI capabilities of text-to-text mLLMs. The results reveal that few-shot prompting with in-context examples from nearest neighbours achieves the best performance, establishing new state-of-the-art BLI scores for many language pairs. We also conduct a series of in-depth analyses and ablation studies, providing more insights on BLI with (m)LLMs, also along with their limitations. "

To tap into the implicit knowledge of LLMs, we experiment with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide explainable answer generation. On top of all, we train a learn to rank (LTR) model in order to combine our different modules, achieving competitive ranking results. Extensive experiments on VWSD demonstrate valuable insights to effectively drive future directions. "

        "abstract": "The prediction of crystal properties plays a crucial role in the crystal design process. Current methods for predicting crystal properties focus on modeling crystal structures using graph neural networks (GNNs). Although GNNs are powerful, accurately modeling the complex interactions between atoms and molecules within a crystal remains a challenge. Surprisingly, predicting crystal properties from crystal text descriptions is understudied, despite the rich information and expressiveness that text data offer. One of the main reasons is the lack of publicly available data for this task. In this paper, we develop and make public a benchmark dataset (called TextEdge) that contains text descriptions of crystal structures with their properties. We then propose LLM-Prop, a method that leverages the general-purpose learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to predict the physical and electronic properties of crystals from their text descriptions. LLM-Prop outperforms the current state-of-the-art GNN-based crystal property predictor by about 4% in predicting band gap, 3% in classifying whether the band gap is direct or indirect, and 66% in predicting unit cell volume. LLM-Prop also outperforms a finetuned MatBERT, a domain-specific pre-trained BERT model, despite having 3 times fewer parameters. Our empirical results may highlight the current inability of GNNs to capture information pertaining to space group symmetry and Wyckoff sites for accurate crystal property prediction. "

In this work, we propose a diffusion model combined with a Generative Adversarial Network, aiming to (i) alleviate one of the remaining challenges in algorithmic music generation which is the control of generation towards a target emotion, and (ii) mitigate the slow sampling drawback of diffusion models applied to symbolic music generation. We first used a trained Variational Autoencoder to obtain embeddings of a symbolic music dataset with emotion labels and then used those to train a diffusion model. Our results demonstrate the successful control of our diffusion model to generate symbolic music with a desired emotion. Our model achieves several orders of magnitude improvement in computational cost, requiring merely four time steps to denoise while the steps required by current state-of-the-art diffusion models for symbolic music generation is in the order of thousands.

The trained VQ-VAE can represent symbolic music as a sequence of indexes that correspond to specific entries in a learned codebook. Subsequently, a discrete diffusion model is used to model the VQ-VAE's discrete latent space. The diffusion model is trained to generate intermediate music sequences consisting of codebook indexes, which are then decoded to symbolic music using the VQ-VAE's decoder. The results demonstrate our model can generate symbolic music with target composer styles that meet the given conditions with a high accuracy of 72.36%. "

        "abstract": "Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) are being increasingly employed in real-life applications, so evaluating them is critical. While the general accuracy of Code LLMs on individual tasks has been extensively evaluated, their self-consistency across different tasks is overlooked. Intuitively, a trustworthy model should be self-consistent when generating natural language specifications for its own code and generating code for its own specifications. Failure to preserve self-consistency reveals a lack of understanding of the shared semantics underlying natural language and programming language, and therefore undermines the trustworthiness of a model. In this paper, we first formally define the self-consistency of Code LLMs and then design a framework, IdentityChain, which effectively and efficiently evaluates the self-consistency and general accuracy of a model at the same time. We study eleven Code LLMs and show that they fail to preserve self-consistency, which is indeed a distinct aspect from general accuracy. Furthermore, we show that IdentityChain can be used as a model debugging tool to expose weaknesses of Code LLMs by demonstrating three major weaknesses that we identify in current models using IdentityChain.

Moreover, existing systems rely on human intervention to perform corrective actions after detection. In this paper, we present Co-AD, a Concept-based Anomaly Detection approach using a Vision Transformer (ViT) that is able to flag misplaced objects without using a prior knowledge base such as a planogram. It uses an auto-encoder architecture followed by outlier detection in the latent space. Co-AD has a peak success rate of 89.90% on anomaly detection image sets of retail objects drawn from the RP2K dataset, compared to 80.81% on the best-performing baseline of a standard ViT auto-encoder. To demonstrate its utility, we describe a robotic mobile manipulation pipeline to autonomously correct the anomalies flagged by Co-AD. This work is ultimately aimed towards developing autonomous mobile robot solutions that reduce the need for human intervention in retail store management. "

The complexity of these tasks makes acquiring expert demonstration data both costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) contain valuable task-related knowledge that can aid in learning these reward functions. However, the direct application of LLMs for proposing reward functions has its limitations such as numerical instability and inability to incorporate the environment feedback. We aim to extract task knowledge from LLMs using environment feedback to create efficient reward functions for physical skills. Our approach consists of two components. We first use the LLM to propose features and parameterization of the reward function. Next, we update the parameters of this proposed reward function through an iterative self-alignment process. In particular, this process minimizes the ranking inconsistency between the LLM and our learned reward functions based on the new observations. We validated our method by testing it on three simulated physical skill learning tasks, demonstrating effective support for our design choices. "

Subsequently, we train CLIP models on these pseudo-labels in addition to the contrastive training on image and text pairs. This simple setup shows substantial improvements of up to 16.3% across different vision tasks, including segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and surface normal estimation. Importantly, these enhancements are achieved without compromising CLIP's existing capabilities, including its proficiency in promptable zero-shot classification. "

Our results show that despite work in low resource modeling, more data still produces better models on a per-language basis. Models explicitly developed for African languages outperform other models on all tasks. Additionally, no one-model-fits-all solution exists for a per-language evaluation of the models evaluated. Moreover, for some languages with a smaller sample size, a larger multilingual model may perform better than a dedicated per-language model for sentiment classification. "

Understanding human desire has the potential to be one of the most fascinating and challenging research domains. It is tightly coupled with sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. It is beneficial for increasing human-computer interactions, recognizing human emotional intelligence, understanding interpersonal relationships, and making decisions. However, understanding human desire is challenging and under-explored because ways of eliciting desire might be different among humans. The task gets more difficult due to the diverse cultures, countries, and languages. Prior studies overlooked the use of image-text pairwise feature representation, which is crucial for the task of human desire understanding. In this research, we have proposed a unified multimodal transformer-based framework with image-text pair settings to identify human desire, sentiment, and emotion. The core of our proposed method lies in the encoder module, which is built using two state-of-the-art multimodal transformer models. These models allow us to extract diverse features. To effectively extract visual and contextualized embedding features from social media image and text pairs, we conducted joint fine-tuning of two pre-trained multimodal transformer models: Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) and Vision-and-Augmented-Language Transformer (VAuLT). Subsequently, we use an early fusion strategy on these embedding features to obtain combined diverse feature representations of the image-text pair.

In this paper, we propose a novel Affine-Consistent Transformer (AC-Former), which directly yields a sequence of nucleus positions and is trained collaboratively through two sub-networks, a global and a local network. The local branch learns to infer distorted input images of smaller scales while the global network outputs the large-scale predictions as extra supervision signals. We further introduce an Adaptive Affine Transformer (AAT) module, which can automatically learn the key spatial transformations to warp original images for local network training. The AAT module works by learning to capture the transformed image regions that are more valuable for training the model.

Furthermore, we propose a Prompt fine-Tuning (PT) scheme to transfer the knowledge from AD prediction task for progressive MCI (pMCI) diagnosis. In details, we first pre-train the VAP-Former without prompts on the AD diagnosis task and then fine-tune the model on the pMCI detection task with PT, which only needs to optimize a small amount of parameters while keeping the backbone frozen. Next, we propose a novel global prompt token for the visual prompts to provide global guidance to the multi-modal representations. Extensive experiments not only show the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods in pMCI prediction but also demonstrate that the global prompt can make the prompt learning process more effective and stable.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in language understanding and may be adopted as semantic parsers in such kinds of methods. However, in doing so, a great challenge for LLMs is to understand the schema of knowledge bases. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an In-Context Schema Understanding (ICSU) method for facilitating LLMs to be used as a semantic parser in KBQA. Specifically, ICSU adopts the In-context Learning mechanism to instruct LLMs to generate SPARQL queries with examples. In order to retrieve appropriate examples from annotated question-query pairs, which contain comprehensive schema information related to questions, ICSU explores four different retrieval strategies. Experimental results on the largest KBQA benchmark, KQA Pro, show that ICSU with all these strategies outperforms that with a random retrieval strategy significantly (from 12\\% to 78.76\\% in accuracy).

For the efficiency of the fully transformer-based framework, we take the nucleus group embeddings as the input prompts of backbone, which helps harvest grouping guided features by tuning only the prompts instead of the whole backbone. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing models on three datasets. "

        "abstract": "Consistency models are a nascent family of generative models that can sample high quality data in one step without the need for adversarial training. Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\\times 64$ respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5$\\times$ and 4$\\times$ improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation in both one-step and two-step settings, while narrowing the gap between consistency models and other state-of-the-art generative models.

        "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely used technique to address the problem of text classification when there is a limited amount of training data. Recent work often tackles this problem using large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 that can generate new examples given already available ones. In this work, we propose a method to generate more helpful augmented data by utilizing the LLM's abilities to follow instructions and perform few-shot classifications. Our specific PromptMix method consists of two steps: 1) generate challenging text augmentations near class boundaries; however, generating borderline examples increases the risk of false positives in the dataset, so we 2) relabel the text augmentations using a prompting-based LLM classifier to enhance the correctness of labels in the generated data. We evaluate the proposed method in challenging 2-shot and zero-shot settings on four text classification datasets: Banking77, TREC6, Subjectivity (SUBJ), and Twitter Complaints. Our experiments show that generating and, crucially, relabeling borderline examples facilitates the transfer of knowledge of a massive LLM like GPT3.5-turbo into smaller and cheaper classifiers like DistilBERT$_{base}$ and BERT$_{base}$. Furthermore, 2-shot PromptMix outperforms multiple 5-shot data augmentation methods on the four datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/PromptMix-EMNLP-2023. "

        "abstract": "Event cameras, or dynamic vision sensors, have recently achieved success from fundamental vision tasks to high-level vision researches. Due to its ability to asynchronously capture light intensity changes, event camera has an inherent advantage to capture moving objects in challenging scenarios including objects under low light, high dynamic range, or fast moving objects. Thus event camera are natural for visual object tracking. However, the current event-based trackers derived from RGB trackers simply modify the input images to event frames and still follow conventional tracking pipeline that mainly focus on object texture for target distinction. As a result, the trackers may not be robust dealing with challenging scenarios such as moving cameras and cluttered foreground. In this paper, we propose a distractor-aware event-based tracker that introduces transformer modules into Siamese network architecture (named DANet). Specifically, our model is mainly composed of a motion-aware network and a target-aware network, which simultaneously exploits both motion cues and object contours from event data, so as to discover motion objects and identify the target object by removing dynamic distractors. Our DANet can be trained in an end-to-end manner without any post-processing and can run at over 80 FPS on a single V100. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two large event tracking datasets to validate the proposed model. We demonstrate that our tracker has superior performance against the state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. "

        "abstract": "Multi-head self-attention-based Transformers have shown promise in different learning tasks. Albeit these models exhibit significant improvement in understanding short-term and long-term contexts from sequences, encoders of Transformers and their variants fail to preserve layer-wise contextual information. Transformers usually project tokens onto sparse manifolds and fail to preserve mathematical equivalence among the token representations. In this work, we propose TransJect, an encoder model that guarantees a theoretical bound for layer-wise distance preservation between a pair of tokens. We propose a simple alternative to dot-product attention to ensure Lipschitz continuity. This allows TransJect to learn injective mappings to transform token representations to different manifolds with similar topology and preserve Euclidean distance between every pair of tokens in subsequent layers. Evaluations across multiple benchmark short- and long-sequence classification tasks show maximum improvements of 6.8% and 5.9%, respectively, over the variants of Transformers. Additionally, TransJect displays 79% better performance than Transformer on the language modeling task. We further highlight the shortcomings of multi-head self-attention from the statistical physics viewpoint. Although multi-head self-attention was incepted to learn different abstraction levels within the networks, our empirical analyses suggest that different attention heads learn randomly and unorderly. In contrast, TransJect adapts a mixture of experts for regularization; these experts are more orderly and balanced and learn different sparse representations from the input sequences. TransJect exhibits very low entropy and can be efficiently scaled to larger depths. "

More recently, LLMs have made rapid advancements that have propelled AI to a new level, enabling even more diverse applications and industrial domains with intelligence, particularly in areas like software engineering and natural language processing. Nevertheless, a number of emerging trustworthiness concerns and issues exhibited in LLMs have already recently received much attention, without properly solving which the widespread adoption of LLMs could be greatly hindered in practice. The distinctive characteristics of LLMs, such as the self-attention mechanism, extremely large model scale, and autoregressive generation schema, differ from classic AI software based on CNNs and RNNs and present new challenges for quality analysis. Up to the present, it still lacks universal and systematic analysis techniques for LLMs despite the urgent industrial demand. Towards bridging this gap, we initiate an early exploratory study and propose a universal analysis framework for LLMs, LUNA, designed to be general and extensible, to enable versatile analysis of LLMs from multiple quality perspectives in a human-interpretable manner. In particular, we first leverage the data from desired trustworthiness perspectives to construct an abstract model as an auxiliary analysis asset, which is empowered by various abstract model construction methods. To assess the quality of the abstract model, we collect and define a number of evaluation metrics, aiming at both abstract model level and the semantics level. Then, the semantics, which is the degree of satisfaction of the LLM w.r.t. the trustworthiness perspective, is bound to and enriches the abstract model with semantics, which enables more detailed analysis applications for diverse purposes.

Recently, it has achieved great progress with the advances of deep learning. However, current methods generally deliver incomplete CD regions and irregular CD boundaries due to the limited representation ability of the extracted visual features. To relieve these issues, in this work we propose a novel Transformer-based learning framework named TransY-Net for remote sensing image CD, which improves the feature extraction from a global view and combines multi-level visual features in a pyramid manner. More specifically, the proposed framework first utilizes the advantages of Transformers in long-range dependency modeling. It can help to learn more discriminative global-level features and obtain complete CD regions. Then, we introduce a novel pyramid structure to aggregate multi-level visual features from Transformers for feature enhancement. The pyramid structure grafted with a Progressive Attention Module (PAM) can improve the feature representation ability with additional inter-dependencies through spatial and channel attentions. Finally, to better train the whole framework, we utilize the deeply-supervised learning with multiple boundary-aware loss functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on four optical and two SAR image CD benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Molecular representation learning is fundamental for many drug related applications. Most existing molecular pre-training models are limited in using single molecular modality, either SMILES or graph representation. To effectively leverage both modalities, we argue that it is critical to capture the fine-grained 'semantics' between SMILES and graph, because subtle sequence/graph differences may lead to contrary molecular properties. In this paper, we propose a universal SMILE-graph representation learning model, namely UniMAP. Firstly, an embedding layer is employed to obtain the token and node/edge representation in SMILES and graph, respectively. A multi-layer Transformer is then utilized to conduct deep cross-modality fusion. Specially, four kinds of pre-training tasks are designed for UniMAP, including Multi-Level Cross-Modality Masking (CMM), SMILES-Graph Matching (SGM), Fragment-Level Alignment (FLA), and Domain Knowledge Learning (DKL). In this way, both global (i.e. SGM and DKL) and local (i.e. CMM and FLA) alignments are integrated to achieve comprehensive cross-modality fusion. We evaluate UniMAP on various downstream tasks, i.e. molecular property prediction, drug-target affinity prediction and drug-drug interaction. Experimental results show that UniMAP outperforms current state-of-the-art pre-training methods.We also visualize the learned representations to demonstrate the effect of multi-modality integration.

The main idea behind our approach is leveraging the domain-neutral capabilities of CLIP as a bridging mechanism, while utilizing a separate module to extract abstract, domain-agnostic semantics from the embeddings of both the source and target realms. Fusing these abstract semantics with target-specific semantics results in a transformed embedding within the CLIP space. To bridge the gap between the disparate worlds of CLIP and StyleGAN, we introduce a new non-linear mapper, the CLIP2P mapper. Utilizing CLIP embeddings, this module is tailored to approximate the latent distribution in the P space, effectively acting as a connector between these two spaces. The proposed UniTranslator is versatile and capable of performing various tasks, including style mixing, stylization, and translations, even in visually challenging scenarios across different visual domains. Notably, UniTranslator generates high-quality translations that showcase domain relevance, diversity, and improved image quality. UniTranslator surpasses the performance of existing general-purpose models and performs well against specialized models in representative tasks. The source code and trained models will be released to the public. "

The model is trained with an on-line imitation learning method. In order to obtain a better training set, a reinforcement learning agent that can directly obtain a ground truth bird's-eye view map from the Carla simulator as a perceptual output, is used as teacher for the imitation learning.

To this end, we further comprehensively investigate how LLMs perform in linguistic emotion recognition if we concentrate on this specific task. Specifically, we exemplify a publicly available and widely used LLM -- Chat General Language Model, and customise it for our target by using two different modal adaptation techniques, i.e., deep prompt tuning and low-rank adaptation. The experimental results obtained on six widely used datasets present that the adapted LLM can easily outperform other state-of-the-art but specialised deep models.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised image Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to learn robust and discriminative representations of normal samples. While separate solutions per class endow expensive computation and limited generalizability, this paper focuses on building a unified framework for multiple classes. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction-based networks with continuous latent representation assumption always suffer from the \"identical shortcut\" issue, where both normal and abnormal samples can be well recovered and difficult to distinguish. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework. First, instead of learning the continuous representations, we preserve the typical normal patterns as discrete iconic prototypes, and confirm the importance of Vector Quantization in preventing the model from falling into the shortcut. The vector quantized iconic prototype is integrated into the Transformer for reconstruction, such that the abnormal data point is flipped to a normal data point.Second, we investigate an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns. Third, a prototype-oriented optimal transport method is proposed to better regulate the prototypes and hierarchically evaluate the abnormal score. By evaluating on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art alternatives and possesses good interpretability.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) appear to provide effective solutions (also) for NER tasks that were traditionally handled with dedicated models, often matching or surpassing the abilities of the dedicated models. Should NER be considered a solved problem? We argue to the contrary: the capabilities provided by LLMs are not the end of NER research, but rather an exciting beginning. They allow taking NER to the next level, tackling increasingly more useful, and increasingly more challenging, variants. We present three variants of the NER task, together with a dataset to support them. The first is a move towards more fine-grained -- and intersectional -- entity types. The second is a move towards zero-shot recognition and extraction of these fine-grained types based on entity-type labels. The third, and most challenging, is the move from the recognition setup to a novel retrieval setup, where the query is a zero-shot entity type, and the expected result is all the sentences from a large, pre-indexed corpus that contain entities of these types, and their corresponding spans. We show that all of these are far from being solved.

It aims to jailbreak a model's safety behavior to make it act as a helpful agent disregarding the harmfulness of the query. Existing methods are primarily based on input text-based red-teaming such as adversarial prompts, low-resource prompts, or contextualized prompts to condition the model in a way to bypass its safe behavior. Bypassing the guardrails uncovers hidden harmful information and biases in the model that are left untreated or newly introduced by its safety training. However, prompt-based attacks fail to provide such a diagnosis owing to their low attack success rate, and applicability to specific models. In this paper, we present a new perspective on LLM safety research i.e., parametric red-teaming through Unalignment. It simply (instruction) tunes the model parameters to break model guardrails that are not deeply rooted in the model's behavior. Unalignment using as few as 100 examples can significantly bypass commonly referred to as CHATGPT, to the point where it responds with an 88% success rate to harmful queries on two safety benchmark datasets. On open-source models such as VICUNA-7B and LLAMA-2-CHAT 7B AND 13B, it shows an attack success rate of more than 91%.

While data sparsity and cold start are two challenges that most recommender systems are still facing, many efforts are devoted to utilizing data from other domains, called cross-domain methods. However, general cross-domain methods explore the relationship between two domains by designing complex model architecture, making it difficult to scale to multiple domains and utilize more data. Moreover, existing recommendation systems use IDs to represent item, which carry less transferable signals in cross-domain scenarios, and user cross-domain behaviors are also sparse, making it challenging to learn item relationship from different domains. These problems hinder the application of multi-domain methods to sequential recommendation. Recently, large language models (LLMs) exhibit outstanding performance in world knowledge learning from text corpora and general-purpose question answering. Inspired by these successes, we propose a simple but effective framework for domain-agnostic recommendation by exploiting the pre-trained LLMs (namely LLM-Rec). We mix the user's behavior across different domains, and then concatenate the title information of these items into a sentence and model the user's behaviors with a pre-trained language model. We expect that by mixing the user's behaviors across different domains, we can exploit the common knowledge encoded in the pre-trained language model to alleviate the problems of data sparsity and cold start problems. Furthermore, we are curious about whether the latest technical advances in nature language processing (NLP) can transfer to the recommendation scenarios. "

In such instances where data is scarce and challenging, a thorough analysis of the structure of such texts rather than a large model may offer a viable solution.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14366",
        "abstract": "Motivation: Biomedical named-entity normalization involves connecting biomedical entities with distinct database identifiers in order to facilitate data integration across various fields of biology. Existing systems for biomedical named entity normalization heavily rely on dictionaries, manually created rules, and high-quality representative features such as lexical or morphological characteristics. However, recent research has investigated the use of neural network-based models to reduce dependence on dictionaries, manually crafted rules, and features. Despite these advancements, the performance of these models is still limited due to the lack of sufficiently large training datasets. These models have a tendency to overfit small training corpora and exhibit poor generalization when faced with previously unseen entities, necessitating the redesign of rules and features. Contribution: We present a novel deep learning approach for named entity normalization, treating it as a pair-wise learning to rank problem. Our method utilizes the widely-used information retrieval algorithm Best Matching 25 to generate candidate concepts, followed by the application of bi-directional encoder representation from the encoder (BERT) to re-rank the candidate list. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for feature-engineering or rule creation. We conduct experiments on species entity types and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art techniques using LINNAEUS and S800 biomedical corpora. Our proposed approach surpasses existing methods in linking entities to the NCBI taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing neural network-based approach for species normalization in the literature. "

        "abstract": "Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can unintentionally leak sensitive information present in their training data. In this paper, we present Model Perturbations (MoPe), a new method to identify with high confidence if a given text is in the training data of a pre-trained language model, given white-box access to the models parameters. MoPe adds noise to the model in parameter space and measures the drop in log-likelihood at a given point $x$, a statistic we show approximates the trace of the Hessian matrix with respect to model parameters. Across language models ranging from $70$M to $12$B parameters, we show that MoPe is more effective than existing loss-based attacks and recently proposed perturbation-based methods. We also examine the role of training point order and model size in attack success, and empirically demonstrate that MoPe accurately approximate the trace of the Hessian in practice. Our results show that the loss of a point alone is insufficient to determine extractability -- there are training points we can recover using our method that have average loss. This casts some doubt on prior works that use the loss of a point as evidence of memorization or unlearning. "

        "abstract": "We introduce GROOT, an imitation learning method for learning robust policies with object-centric and 3D priors. GROOT builds policies that generalize beyond their initial training conditions for vision-based manipulation. It constructs object-centric 3D representations that are robust toward background changes and camera views and reason over these representations using a transformer-based policy. Furthermore, we introduce a segmentation correspondence model that allows policies to generalize to new objects at test time. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the robustness of GROOT policies against perceptual variations in simulated and real-world environments. GROOT's performance excels in generalization over background changes, camera viewpoint shifts, and the presence of new object instances, whereas both state-of-the-art end-to-end learning methods and object proposal-based approaches fall short. We also extensively evaluate GROOT policies on real robots, where we demonstrate the efficacy under very wild changes in setup.

Thus, the same situation can often result in different emotional experiences. While the detection of emotion is a well-established task, there is very limited work so far on the automatic prediction of cognitive appraisals. This work fills the gap by presenting CovidET-Appraisals, the most comprehensive dataset to-date that assesses 24 appraisal dimensions, each with a natural language rationale, across 241 Reddit posts. CovidET-Appraisals presents an ideal testbed to evaluate the ability of large language models -- excelling at a wide range of NLP tasks -- to automatically assess and explain cognitive appraisals. We found that while the best models are performant, open-sourced LLMs fall short at this task, presenting a new challenge in the future development of emotionally intelligent models.

However, retrieving passages from a given source is known to suffer from insufficient knowledge coverage. Alternatively, prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate contextual passages based on their parametric knowledge has been shown to improve QA performance. Yet, LLMs tend to \"hallucinate\" content that conflicts with the retrieved knowledge. Based on the intuition that answers supported by both sources are more likely to be correct, we propose COMBO, a Compatibility-Oriented knowledge Merging for Better Open-domain QA framework, to effectively leverage the two sources of information. Concretely, we match LLM-generated passages with retrieved counterparts into compatible pairs, based on discriminators trained with silver compatibility labels. Then a Fusion-in-Decoder-based reader model handles passage pairs to arrive at the final answer. Experiments show that COMBO outperforms competitive baselines on three out of four tested open-domain QA benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that our proposed framework demonstrates greater efficacy in scenarios with a higher degree of knowledge conflicts. "

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have exhibited promising performance in solving sequential decision-making problems. By imitating few-shot examples provided in the prompts (i.e., in-context learning), an LLM agent can interact with an external environment and complete given tasks without additional training. However, such few-shot examples are often insufficient to generate high-quality solutions for complex and long-horizon tasks, while the limited context length cannot consume larger-scale demonstrations. To this end, we propose an offline learning framework that utilizes offline data at scale (e.g, logs of human interactions) to facilitate the in-context learning performance of LLM agents. We formally define LLM-powered policies with both text-based approaches and code-based approaches. We then introduce an Offline Data-driven Discovery and Distillation (O3D) framework to improve LLM-powered policies without finetuning. O3D automatically discovers reusable skills and distills generalizable knowledge across multiple tasks based on offline interaction data, advancing the capability of solving downstream tasks. Empirical results under two interactive decision-making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop) demonstrate that O3D can notably enhance the decision-making capabilities of LLMs through the offline discovery and distillation process, and consistently outperform baselines across various LLMs with both text-based-policy and code-based-policy.

Our analysis investigates the conditions where demonstrations are most helpful, and shows that adding even one demonstration is significantly beneficial. We propose a novel demonstration selection strategy based on difficulty rather than the commonly used semantic similarity.

        "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has gained significant popularity in computer vision tasks due to its capacity to generalize and capture long-range dependencies. This characteristic makes it well-suited for generating spatiotemporal tokens from videos. On the other hand, convolutions serve as the fundamental backbone for processing images and videos, as they efficiently aggregate information within small local neighborhoods to create spatial tokens that describe the spatial dimension of a video. While both CNN-based architectures and pure transformer architectures are extensively studied and utilized by researchers, the effective combination of these two backbones has not received comparable attention in the field of activity recognition. In this research, we propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers in an hybrid architecture for performing activity recognition using RGB videos. Specifically, we suggest employing a CNN network to enhance the video representation by generating a 128-channel video that effectively separates the human performing the activity from the background. Subsequently, the output of the CNN module is fed into a transformer to extract spatiotemporal tokens, which are then used for classification purposes. Our architecture has achieved new SOTA results with 90.05 \\%, 99.6\\%, and 95.09\\% on HMDB51, UCF101, and ETRI-Activity3D respectively. "

We found a significant statement-to-statement correlation between the LLMs and humans, irrespective of the type of statements and the prompting technique used. However, LLMs systematically overestimate the profoundness of nonsensical statements, with the exception of Tk-instruct, which uniquely underestimates the profoundness of statements. Only few-shot learning prompts, as opposed to chain-of-thought prompting, draw LLMs ratings closer to humans. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the potential biases induced by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), inducing an increase in the bias to overestimate the profoundness of statements.

We show that our method is effective across widely used model families, reducing instances of indecisive (or \"tie\") outcomes by up to 54% compared to a random sample when focusing on the top-20 percentile of prioritized instances.

This study evaluates the application of natural language text generators to fill this data gap in multiple security-related text classification tasks. We describe a variety of previously-unexamined language-model fine-tuning approaches for this purpose and consider in particular the impact of disproportionate class-imbalances in the training set. Across our evaluation using three state-of-the-art classifiers designed for offensive language detection, review fraud detection, and SMS spam detection, we find that models trained with GPT-3 data augmentation strategies outperform both models trained without augmentation and models trained using basic data augmentation strategies already in common usage.

The task aims to advance machine translation (MT) by challenging participants to develop systems that accurately translate technical terms, ultimately enhancing communication and understanding in specialised domains. To this end, we conduct experiments that utilise large language models (LLMs) for two purposes: generating synthetic bilingual terminology-based data, and post-editing translations generated by an MT model through incorporating pre-approved terms. Our system employs a four-step process: (i) using an LLM to generate bilingual synthetic data based on the provided terminology, (ii) fine-tuning a generic encoder-decoder MT model, with a mix of the terminology-based synthetic data generated in the first step and a randomly sampled portion of the original generic training data, (iii) generating translations with the fine-tuned MT model, and (iv) finally, leveraging an LLM for terminology-constrained automatic post-editing of the translations that do not include the required terms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving the integration of pre-approved terms into translations. The number of terms incorporated into the translations of the blind dataset increases from an average of 36.67% with the generic model to an average of 72.88% by the end of the process.

        "abstract": "We present a supervised learning framework of training generative models for density estimation. Generative models, including generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows, variational auto-encoders, are usually considered as unsupervised learning models, because labeled data are usually unavailable for training. Despite the success of the generative models, there are several issues with the unsupervised training, e.g., requirement of reversible architectures, vanishing gradients, and training instability. To enable supervised learning in generative models, we utilize the score-based diffusion model to generate labeled data. Unlike existing diffusion models that train neural networks to learn the score function, we develop a training-free score estimation method. This approach uses mini-batch-based Monte Carlo estimators to directly approximate the score function at any spatial-temporal location in solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE), corresponding to the reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE). This approach can offer both high accuracy and substantial time savings in neural network training. Once the labeled data are generated, we can train a simple fully connected neural network to learn the generative model in the supervised manner. Compared with existing normalizing flow models, our method does not require to use reversible neural networks and avoids the computation of the Jacobian matrix. Compared with existing diffusion models, our method does not need to solve the reverse-time SDE to generate new samples. As a result, the sampling efficiency is significantly improved. We demonstrate the performance of our method by applying it to a set of 2D datasets as well as real data from the UCI repository. "

Therefore, an important question is how to detect whether the texts are generated by ChatGPT or by humans. Existing detectors are built on the assumption that there is a distribution gap between human-generated and AI-generated texts. These gaps are typically identified using statistical information or classifiers. In contrast to prior research methods, we find that large language models such as ChatGPT exhibit strong self-consistency in text generation and continuation. Self-consistency capitalizes on the intuition that AI-generated texts can still be reasoned with by large language models using the same logical reasoning when portions of the texts are masked, which differs from human-generated texts. Using this observation, we subsequently proposed a new method for AI-generated texts detection based on self-consistency with masked predictions to determine whether a text is generated by LLMs. This method, which we call DetectGPT-SC. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of DetectGPT-SC. In these experiments, we employed various mask scheme, zero-shot, and simple prompt for completing masked texts and self-consistency predictions.

However, the computational complexity inherent in these methodologies presents a substantial impediment, constraining the attainable frame rates and resolutions in practical applications. In response to this predicament, we propose VQ-NeRF, an effective and efficient pipeline for enhancing implicit neural representations via vector quantization. The essence of our method involves reducing the sampling space of NeRF to a lower resolution and subsequently reinstating it to the original size utilizing a pre-trained VAE decoder, thereby effectively mitigating the sampling time bottleneck encountered during rendering. Although the codebook furnishes representative features, reconstructing fine texture details of the scene remains challenging due to high compression rates. To overcome this constraint, we design an innovative multi-scale NeRF sampling scheme that concurrently optimizes the NeRF model at both compressed and original scales to enhance the network's ability to preserve fine details. Furthermore, we incorporate a semantic loss function to improve the geometric fidelity and semantic coherence of our 3D reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in achieving the optimal trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency.

Concretely, we hypothesize that the LM implicitly embeds a reasoning tree resembling the correct reasoning process within it. We test this hypothesis by introducing a new probing approach (called MechanisticProbe) that recovers the reasoning tree from the model's attention patterns. We use our probe to analyze two LMs: GPT-2 on a synthetic task (k-th smallest element), and LLaMA on two simple language-based reasoning tasks (ProofWriter & AI2 Reasoning Challenge).

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. Despite the models only seeing text in training, several recent studies suggest that LLM representations implicitly capture aspects of the underlying grounded concepts. Here, we explore LLM representations of a particularly salient kind of grounded knowledge -- spatial relationships. We design natural-language navigation tasks and evaluate the ability of LLMs, in particular GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2 series models, to represent and reason about spatial structures, and compare these abilities to human performance on the same tasks. These tasks reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across different spatial structures, including square, hexagonal, and triangular grids, rings, and trees. We also discover that, similar to humans, LLMs utilize object names as landmarks for maintaining spatial maps. Finally, in extensive error analysis, we find that LLMs' mistakes reflect both spatial and non-spatial factors. These findings suggest that LLMs appear to capture certain aspects of spatial structure implicitly, but room for improvement remains. "

        "abstract": "Instruction tuned large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, demonstrate remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks. Despite numerous recent studies that examine the performance of instruction-tuned LLMs on various NLP benchmarks, there remains a lack of comprehensive investigation into their ability to understand cross-lingual sociopragmatic meaning (SM), i.e., meaning embedded within social and interactive contexts. This deficiency arises partly from SM not being adequately represented in any of the existing benchmarks. To address this gap, we present SPARROW, an extensive multilingual benchmark specifically designed for SM understanding. SPARROW comprises 169 datasets covering 13 task types across six primary categories (e.g., anti-social language detection, emotion recognition). SPARROW datasets encompass 64 different languages originating from 12 language families representing 16 writing scripts. We evaluate the performance of various multilingual pretrained language models (e.g., mT5) and instruction-tuned LLMs (e.g., BLOOMZ, ChatGPT) on SPARROW through fine-tuning, zero-shot, and/or few-shot learning. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that existing open-source instruction tuned LLMs still struggle to understand SM across various languages, performing close to a random baseline in some cases. We also find that although ChatGPT outperforms many LLMs, it still falls behind task-specific finetuned models with a gap of 12.19 SPARROW score.

Our carefully designed human evaluation substantiates the serious hallucination issue, revealing that even GPT-3.5 produces factual outputs less than 25% of the time. This underscores the importance of fact verifiers in order to measure and incentivize progress. Our systematic investigation affirms that LLMs can be repurposed as effective fact verifiers with strong correlations with human judgments, at least in the Wikipedia domain. Surprisingly, FLAN-T5-11B, the least factual generator in our study, performs the best as a fact verifier, even outperforming more capable LLMs like GPT3.5 and ChatGPT. Delving deeper, we analyze the reliance of these LLMs on high-quality evidence, as well as their deficiencies in robustness and generalization ability. Our study presents insights for developing trustworthy generation models. "

In contrast, the vision modules in VLMs are weaker than LLMs and may result in misleading visual representations, which are then translated to confident mistakes by LLMs. To study these two types of VLM mistakes, i.e., language hallucination and visual illusion, we curated HallusionBench, an image-context reasoning benchmark that is still challenging to even GPT-4V and LLaVA-1.5.

        "abstract": "Road user trajectory prediction in dynamic environments is a challenging but crucial task for various applications, such as autonomous driving. One of the main challenges in this domain is the multimodal nature of future trajectories stemming from the unknown yet diverse intentions of the agents. Diffusion models have shown to be very effective in capturing such stochasticity in prediction tasks. However, these models involve many computationally expensive denoising steps and sampling operations that make them a less desirable option for real-time safety-critical applications. To this end, we present a novel framework that leverages diffusion models for predicting future trajectories in a computationally efficient manner. To minimize the computational bottlenecks in iterative sampling, we employ an efficient sampling mechanism that allows us to maximize the number of sampled trajectories for improved accuracy while maintaining inference time in real time. Moreover, we propose a scoring mechanism to select the most plausible trajectories by assigning relative ranks. We show the effectiveness of our approach by conducting empirical evaluations on common pedestrian (UCY/ETH) and autonomous driving (nuScenes) benchmark datasets on which our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several subsets and metrics.

Exploring various prompting strategies, we evaluated GPT-4 on a diverse range of common radiology tasks and we found GPT-4 either outperforms or is on par with current SOTA radiology models. With zero-shot prompting, GPT-4 already obtains substantial gains ($\\approx$ 10% absolute improvement) over radiology models in temporal sentence similarity classification (accuracy) and natural language inference ($F_1$). For tasks that require learning dataset-specific style or schema (e.g. findings summarisation), GPT-4 improves with example-based prompting and matches supervised SOTA. Our extensive error analysis with a board-certified radiologist shows GPT-4 has a sufficient level of radiology knowledge with only occasional errors in complex context that require nuanced domain knowledge. For findings summarisation, GPT-4 outputs are found to be overall comparable with existing manually-written impressions. "

However, based on the fact that the current SNN input data flow is split into tensors to process on GPUs, none of the previous works consider the properties of tensors to implement an attention module. This inspires us to rethink current SNN from the perspective of tensor-relevant theories. Using tensor decomposition, we design the \\textit{projected full attention} (PFA) module, which demonstrates excellent results with linearly growing parameters. Specifically, PFA is composed by the \\textit{linear projection of spike tensor} (LPST) module and \\textit{attention map composing} (AMC) module. In LPST, we start by compressing the original spike tensor into three projected tensors using a single property-preserving strategy with learnable parameters for each dimension. Then, in AMC, we exploit the inverse procedure of the tensor decomposition process to combine the three tensors into the attention map using a so-called connecting factor. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed PFA module, we integrate it into the widely used VGG and ResNet architectures for classification tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic benchmark datasets, surpassing the existing SNN models with Transformer-based and CNN-based backbones. "

To address this limitation, we introduce Co-Prediction Prompt Tuning for noise correction in FET, which leverages multiple prediction results to identify and correct noisy labels. Specifically, we integrate prediction results to recall labeled labels and utilize a differentiated margin to identify inaccurate labels. Moreover, we design an optimization objective concerning divergent co-predictions during fine-tuning, ensuring that the model captures sufficient information and maintains robustness in noise identification. Experimental results on three widely-used FET datasets demonstrate that our noise correction approach significantly enhances the quality of various types of training samples, including those annotated using distant supervision, ChatGPT, and crowdsourcing.

Compared to embeddings used by previous works, the proposed prefixes can provide richer information for the model. Furthermore, we adopt a recursive way of using language models in the process of style transfer. This strategy provides a more effective way for the interactions between the input sentence and GPT-2, helps the model construct more informative prefixes, and thus, helps improve the performance.

        "abstract": "Recent literature has suggested the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to make predictions for tabular tasks. However, LLMs have been shown to exhibit harmful social biases that reflect the stereotypes and inequalities present in the society. To this end, as well as the widespread use of tabular data in many high-stake applications, it is imperative to explore the following questions: what sources of information do LLMs draw upon when making predictions for tabular tasks; whether and to what extent are LLM predictions for tabular tasks influenced by social biases and stereotypes; and what are the consequential implications for fairness? Through a series of experiments, we delve into these questions and show that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data which significantly impact their fairness in tabular prediction tasks. Furthermore, our investigations show that in the context of bias mitigation, though in-context learning and fine-tuning have a moderate effect, the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. This observation emphasizes that the social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pre-training corpus, not only from the downstream task datasets. Besides, we demonstrate that label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce biases, further highlighting the presence of inherent bias within LLMs. "

Our proposed approach draws inspiration from a penalization technique adopted in {\\it{[Boscarino et. al, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2014]}}. By employing an additive implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method, the scheme can ensure a correct asymptotic behavior for the limiting diffusion equation, without suffering from a parabolic-type time step restriction which often afflicts multiscale problems in the diffusive limit. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate high order accuracy, asymptotic preserving, and asymptotically accurate properties of the designed schemes. "

        "abstract": "In the wake of the burgeoning expansion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services, the computational demands inherent to these technologies frequently necessitate cloud-powered computational offloading, particularly for resource-constrained mobile devices. These services commonly employ prompts to steer the generative process, and both the prompts and the resultant content, such as text and images, may harbor privacy-sensitive or confidential information, thereby elevating security and privacy risks. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce $\\Lambda$-Split, a split computing framework to facilitate computational offloading while simultaneously fortifying data privacy against risks such as eavesdropping and unauthorized access. In $\\Lambda$-Split, a generative model, usually a deep neural network (DNN), is partitioned into three sub-models and distributed across the user's local device and a cloud server: the input-side and output-side sub-models are allocated to the local, while the intermediate, computationally-intensive sub-model resides on the cloud server. This architecture ensures that only the hidden layer outputs are transmitted, thereby preventing the external transmission of privacy-sensitive raw input and output data. Given the black-box nature of DNNs, estimating the original input or output from intercepted hidden layer outputs poses a significant challenge for malicious eavesdroppers. Moreover, $\\Lambda$-Split is orthogonal to traditional encryption-based security mechanisms, offering enhanced security when deployed in conjunction. We empirically validate the efficacy of the $\\Lambda$-Split framework using Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion XL, representative large language and diffusion models developed by Meta and Stability AI, respectively.

Instant-NGP (INGP) introduced multi-resolution hash encoding from a lookup table of trainable feature grids which enabled learning high-quality neural graphics primitives in a matter of seconds. However, this improvement came at the cost of higher storage size. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing instant learning of compression-aware NeRF features (CAwa-NeRF), that allows exporting the zip compressed feature grids at the end of the model training with a negligible extra time overhead without changing neither the storage architecture nor the parameters used in the original INGP paper. Nonetheless, the proposed method is not limited to INGP but could also be adapted to any model. By means of extensive simulations, our proposed instant learning pipeline can achieve impressive results on different kinds of static scenes such as single object masked background scenes and real-life scenes captured in our studio. In particular, for single object masked background scenes CAwa-NeRF compresses the feature grids down to 6% (1.2 MB) of the original size without any loss in the PSNR (33 dB) or down to 2.4% (0.53 MB) with a slight virtual loss (32.31 dB).

MAS leverages a diffusion model trained solely on 2D data, opening opportunities to exciting and diverse fields of motion previously under-explored as 3D data is scarce and hard to collect. MAS works by simultaneously denoising multiple 2D motion sequences representing the same motion from different angles. Our consistency block ensures consistency across all views at each diffusion step by combining the individual generations into a unified 3D sequence, and projecting it back to the original views for the next iteration. We demonstrate MAS on 2D pose data acquired from videos depicting professional basketball maneuvers, rhythmic gymnastic performances featuring a ball apparatus, and horse obstacle course races. In each of these domains, 3D motion capture is arduous, and yet, MAS generates diverse and realistic 3D sequences without textual conditioning. As we demonstrate, our ancestral sampling-based approach offers a more natural integration with the diffusion framework compared to popular denoising optimization-based approaches, and avoids common issues such as out-of-domain sampling, lack of details and mode-collapse. https://guytevet.github.io/mas-page/ "

        "abstract": "This paper delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring input text for LLMs and is a technique integral to optimizing the efficacy of LLMs. This survey elucidates foundational principles of prompt engineering, such as role-prompting, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, as well as more advanced methodologies such as the chain-of-thought and tree-of-thoughts prompting. The paper sheds light on how external assistance in the form of plugins can assist in this task, and reduce machine hallucination by retrieving external knowledge. We subsequently delineate prospective directions in prompt engineering research, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of structures and the role of agents in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) tools. We discuss how to assess the efficacy of prompt methods from different perspectives and using different methods. Finally, we gather information about the application of prompt engineering in such fields as education and programming, showing its transformative potential. This comprehensive survey aims to serve as a friendly guide for anyone venturing through the big world of LLMs and prompt engineering. "

Specifically, zero-shot CoT achieves remarkable improvements in a wide range of reasoning tasks by simply instructing the LLM with the prompt \"Let's think step by step!\". Despite the success of zero-shot CoT, the existing zero-shot prompting techniques remain limited to a single language, making it challenging to generalize to other languages and hindering global development. In this work, we introduce cross-lingual prompting (CLP), aiming to improve zero-shot CoT reasoning across languages. Specifically, CLP consists of two main components: (1) cross-lingual alignment prompting and (2) task-specific solver prompting. The cross-lingual alignment prompting is responsible for aligning representations across different languages, whereas the task-specific solver prompting is used to generate the final chain of thoughts and results for the reasoning task. In addition, we further introduce cross-lingual self-consistent prompting (CLSP) to ensemble different reasoning paths across languages. Our experimental evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that CLP and CLSP significantly outperform the existing prompting methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Our findings reveal variations in model responses on different task categories, e.g., logic vs. literacy, when instructed in English or Arabic.

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the success of introducing Transformers to time series forecasting. From a data generation perspective, we illustrate that existing Transformers are susceptible to distribution shifts driven by temporal contexts, whether observed or unobserved. Such context-driven distribution shift (CDS) introduces biases in predictions within specific contexts and poses challenges for conventional training paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a universal calibration methodology for the detection and adaptation of CDS with a trained Transformer model. To this end, we propose a novel CDS detector, termed the \"residual-based CDS detector\" or \"Reconditionor\", which quantifies the model's vulnerability to CDS by evaluating the mutual information between prediction residuals and their corresponding contexts. A high Reconditionor score indicates a severe susceptibility, thereby necessitating model adaptation. In this circumstance, we put forth a straightforward yet potent adapter framework for model calibration, termed the \"sample-level contextualized adapter\" or \"SOLID\". This framework involves the curation of a contextually similar dataset to the provided test sample and the subsequent fine-tuning of the model's prediction layer with a limited number of steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this adaptation strategy is able to achieve an optimal equilibrium between bias and variance. Notably, our proposed Reconditionor and SOLID are model-agnostic and readily adaptable to a wide range of Transformers. Extensive experiments show that SOLID consistently enhances the performance of current SOTA Transformers on real-world datasets, especially on cases with substantial CDS detected by the proposed Reconditionor, thus validate the effectiveness of the calibration approach.

        "abstract": "In recent years, studies on image generation models of spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained the attention of many researchers. Variational autoencoders (VAEs), as one of the most popular image generation models, have attracted a lot of work exploring their SNN implementation. Due to the constrained binary representation in SNNs, existing SNN VAE methods implicitly construct the latent space by an elaborated autoregressive network and use the network outputs as the sampling variables. However, this unspecified implicit representation of the latent space will increase the difficulty of generating high-quality images and introduces additional network parameters. In this paper, we propose an efficient spiking variational autoencoder (ESVAE) that constructs an interpretable latent space distribution and design a reparameterizable spiking sampling method. Specifically, we construct the prior and posterior of the latent space as a Poisson distribution using the firing rate of the spiking neurons. Subsequently, we propose a reparameterizable Poisson spiking sampling method, which is free from the additional network. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results show that the proposed ESVAE outperforms previous SNN VAE methods in reconstructed & generated images quality. In addition, experiments demonstrate that ESVAE's encoder is able to retain the original image information more efficiently, and the decoder is more robust.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM's) have demonstrated considerable success in various Natural Language Processing tasks, but they have yet to attain state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Nevertheless, their significant performance in tasks demanding a broad understanding and contextual processing shows their potential for translation. To exploit these abilities, we investigate using LLM's for MT and explore recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Surprisingly, our initial experiments find that fine-tuning for translation purposes even led to performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose an alternative approach: adapting LLM's as Automatic Post-Editors (APE) rather than direct translators. Building on the LLM's exceptional ability to process and generate lengthy sequences, we also propose extending our approach to document-level translation. We show that leveraging Low-Rank-Adapter fine-tuning for APE can yield significant improvements across both sentence and document-level metrics while generalizing to out-of-domain data. Most notably, we achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy rate of 89\\% on the ContraPro test set, which specifically assesses the model's ability to resolve pronoun ambiguities when translating from English to German. Lastly, we investigate a practical scenario involving manual post-editing for document-level translation, where reference context is made available.

To address those issues, we propose non-autoregressive streaming Transformer (NAST) which comprises a unidirectional encoder and a non-autoregressive decoder with intra-chunk parallelism. We enable NAST to generate the blank token or repetitive tokens to adjust its READ/WRITE strategy flexibly, and train it to maximize the non-monotonic latent alignment with an alignment-based latency loss.

        "abstract": "The task of action-driven human motion prediction aims to forecast future human motion from the observed sequence while respecting the given action label. It requires modeling not only the stochasticity within human motion but the smooth yet realistic transition between multiple action labels. However, the fact that most of the datasets do not contain such transition data complicates this task. Existing work tackles this issue by learning a smoothness prior to simply promote smooth transitions, yet doing so can result in unnatural transitions especially when the history and predicted motions differ significantly in orientations. In this paper, we argue that valid human motion transitions should incorporate realistic leg movements to handle orientation changes, and cast it as an action-conditioned in-betweening (ACB) learning task to encourage transition naturalness. Because modeling all possible transitions is virtually unreasonable, our ACB is only performed on very few selected action classes with active gait motions, such as Walk or Run. Specifically, we follow a two-stage forecasting strategy by first employing the motion diffusion model to generate the target motion with a specified future action, and then producing the in-betweening to smoothly connect the observation and prediction to eventually address motion prediction. Our method is completely free from the labeled motion transition data during training. To show the robustness of our approach, we generalize our trained in-betweening learning model on one dataset to two unseen large-scale motion datasets to produce natural transitions. Extensive methods on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields the state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality, prediction accuracy, and action faithfulness. "

Today's large language models (LLMs) possess human-level linguistic competence and can execute complex tasks requiring abstract knowledge and reasoning. To deeply understand the inherent mechanisms of intelligence emergence in LLMs, this paper conducts an analogical research using brain localization as a prototype. We have discovered a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. This core region exhibits significant dimension dependency, and perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions can lead to a loss of linguistic competence. Furthermore, we observe that an improvement in linguistic competence does not necessarily accompany an elevation in the model's knowledge level, which might imply the existence of regions of domain knowledge that are dissociated from the linguistic region. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence. In the future, we will continue to investigate knowledge regions within LLMs and the interactions between them. "

        "abstract": "Animacy - whether an entity is alive and sentient - is fundamental to cognitive processing, impacting areas such as memory, vision, and language. However, animacy is not always expressed directly in language: in English it often manifests indirectly, in the form of selectional constraints on verbs and adjectives. This poses a potential issue for transformer language models (LMs): they often train only on text, and thus lack access to extralinguistic information from which humans learn about animacy. We ask: how does this impact LMs' animacy processing - do they still behave as humans do? We answer this question using open-source LMs. Like previous studies, we find that LMs behave much like humans when presented with entities whose animacy is typical. However, we also show that even when presented with stories about atypically animate entities, such as a peanut in love, LMs adapt: they treat these entities as animate, though they do not adapt as well as humans. Even when the context indicating atypical animacy is very short, LMs pick up on subtle clues and change their behavior. We conclude that despite the limited signal through which LMs can learn about animacy, they are indeed sensitive to the relevant lexical semantic nuances available in English. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15007",
        "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) poised to become embedded in our daily lives, questions are starting to be raised about the dataset(s) they learned from. These questions range from potential bias or misinformation LLMs could retain from their training data to questions of copyright and fair use of human-generated text. However, while these questions emerge, developers of the recent state-of-the-art LLMs become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their training corpus. We here introduce the task of document-level membership inference for real-world LLMs, i.e. inferring whether the LLM has seen a given document during training or not. First, we propose a procedure for the development and evaluation of document-level membership inference for LLMs by leveraging commonly used data sources for training and the model release date. We then propose a practical, black-box method to predict document-level membership and instantiate it on OpenLLaMA-7B with both books and academic papers. We show our methodology to perform very well, reaching an impressive AUC of 0.856 for books and 0.678 for papers. We then show our approach to outperform the sentence-level membership inference attacks used in the privacy literature for the document-level membership task. We finally evaluate whether smaller models might be less sensitive to document-level inference and show OpenLLaMA-3B to be approximately as sensitive as OpenLLaMA-7B to our approach. Taken together, our results show that accurate document-level membership can be inferred for LLMs, increasing the transparency of technology poised to change our lives. "

In contrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network inferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric details.To holistically improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of image-to-3D tasks, we propose a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To ensure consistency, we employ a multi-view cross-domain attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and modalities. Lastly, we introduce a geometry-aware normal fusion algorithm that extracts high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and reasonably good efficiency compared to prior works. "

        "abstract": "The popularity of transformer-based text embeddings calls for better statistical tools for measuring distributions of such embeddings. One such tool would be a method for ranking texts within a corpus by centrality, i.e. assigning each text a number signifying how representative that text is of the corpus as a whole. However, an intrinsic center-outward ordering of high-dimensional text representations is not trivial. A statistical depth is a function for ranking k-dimensional objects by measuring centrality with respect to some observed k-dimensional distribution. We adopt a statistical depth to measure distributions of transformer-based text embeddings, transformer-based text embedding (TTE) depth, and introduce the practical use of this depth for both modeling and distributional inference in NLP pipelines. We first define TTE depth and an associated rank sum test for determining whether two corpora differ significantly in embedding space. We then use TTE depth for the task of in-context learning prompt selection, showing that this approach reliably improves performance over statistical baseline approaches across six text classification tasks. Finally, we use TTE depth and the associated rank sum test to characterize the distributions of synthesized and human-generated corpora, showing that five recent synthetic data augmentation processes cause a measurable distributional shift away from associated human-generated text.

        "abstract": "Recently, Transformer-based models have achieved promising results in various vision tasks, due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, transformers are computationally expensive, which limits their applications in real-time tasks such as autonomous driving. In addition, an efficient local and global feature selection and fusion are vital for accurate dense prediction, especially driving scene understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose a real-time semantic segmentation architecture named Pyramid Pooling Axial Transformer (P2AT). The proposed P2AT takes a coarse feature from the CNN encoder to produce scale-aware contextual features, which are then combined with the multi-level feature aggregation scheme to produce enhanced contextual features. Specifically, we introduce a pyramid pooling axial transformer to capture intricate spatial and channel dependencies, leading to improved performance on semantic segmentation. Then, we design a Bidirectional Fusion module (BiF) to combine semantic information at different levels. Meanwhile, a Global Context Enhancer is introduced to compensate for the inadequacy of concatenating different semantic levels. Finally, a decoder block is proposed to help maintain a larger receptive field. We evaluate P2AT variants on three challenging scene-understanding datasets. In particular, our P2AT variants achieve state-of-art results on the Camvid dataset 80.5%, 81.0%, 81.1% for P2AT-S, P2ATM, and P2AT-L, respectively. Furthermore, our experiment on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed architecture, with results showing that P2AT-M, achieves 78.7% on Cityscapes.

Existing benchmarks often focus on lexical generalization, the interpretation of novel lexical items in syntactic structures familiar from training; structural generalization tasks, where a model needs to interpret syntactic structures that are themselves unfamiliar from training, are often underrepresented, resulting in overly optimistic perceptions of how well models can generalize. We introduce SLOG, a semantic parsing dataset that extends COGS (Kim and Linzen, 2020) with 17 structural generalization cases. In our experiments, the generalization accuracy of Transformer models, including pretrained ones, only reaches 40.6%, while a structure-aware parser only achieves 70.8%. These results are far from the near-perfect accuracy existing models achieve on COGS, demonstrating the role of SLOG in foregrounding the large discrepancy between models' lexical and structural generalization capacities.

        "abstract": "With the increasing integration of smartphones into our daily lives, fingerphotos are becoming a potential contactless authentication method. While it offers convenience, it is also more vulnerable to spoofing using various presentation attack instruments (PAI). The contactless fingerprint is an emerging biometric authentication but has not yet been heavily investigated for anti-spoofing. While existing anti-spoofing approaches demonstrated fair results, they have encountered challenges in terms of universality and scalability to detect any unseen/unknown spoofed samples. To address this issue, we propose a universal presentation attack detection method for contactless fingerprints, despite having limited knowledge of presentation attack samples. We generated synthetic contactless fingerprints using StyleGAN from live finger photos and integrating them to train a semi-supervised ResNet-18 model. A novel joint loss function, combining the Arcface and Center loss, is introduced with a regularization to balance between the two loss functions and minimize the variations within the live samples while enhancing the inter-class variations between the deepfake and live samples. We also conducted a comprehensive comparison of different regularizations' impact on the joint loss function for presentation attack detection (PAD) and explored the performance of a modified ResNet-18 architecture with different activation functions (i.e., leaky ReLU and RelU) in conjunction with Arcface and center loss. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model using unseen types of spoof attacks and live data. Our proposed method achieves a Bona Fide Classification Error Rate (BPCER) of 0.12\\%, an Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) of 0.63\\%, and an Average Classification Error Rate (ACER) of 0.37\\%.

We further demonstrate meta-OCL in a synthetic computer vision setting, and propose two hypotheses for the emergence of meta-OCL: one relying on the way models store knowledge in their parameters, and another suggesting that the implicit gradient alignment bias of gradient-descent-based optimizers may be responsible.

One important step towards this goal is to localize and track key active objects that undergo major state change as a consequence of human actions/interactions to the environment without being told exactly what/where to ground (e.g., localizing and tracking the `sponge` in video from the instruction \"Dip the `sponge` into the bucket.\"). While existing works approach this problem from a pure vision perspective, we investigate to which extent the textual modality (i.e., task instructions) and their interaction with visual modality can be beneficial. Specifically, we propose to improve phrase grounding models' ability on localizing the active objects by: (1) learning the role of `objects undergoing change` and extracting them accurately from the instructions, (2) leveraging pre- and post-conditions of the objects during actions, and (3) recognizing the objects more robustly with descriptional knowledge. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract the aforementioned action-object knowledge, and design a per-object aggregation masking technique to effectively perform joint inference on object phrases and symbolic knowledge. We evaluate our framework on Ego4D and Epic-Kitchens datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which leads to>54% improvements in all standard metrics on the TREK-150-OPE-Det localization + tracking task, >7% improvements in all standard metrics on the TREK-150-OPE tracking task, and >3% improvements in average precision (AP) on the Ego4D SCOD task.

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data. However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance. In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. Extensive experiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to 60.8\\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\\% in terms of training time) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to face swapping from the perspective of fine-grained facial editing, dubbed \"editing for swapping\" (E4S). The traditional face swapping methods rely on global feature extraction and often fail to preserve the source identity. In contrast, our framework proposes a Regional GAN Inversion (RGI) method, which allows the explicit disentanglement of shape and texture. Specifically, our E4S performs face swapping in the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoder is applied to project the texture of each facial component into regional style codes and a mask-guided injection module then manipulates feature maps with the style codes. Based on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified as style and mask swapping. Besides, since reconstructing the source face in the target image may lead to disharmony lighting, we propose to train a re-coloring network to make the swapped face maintain the lighting condition on the target face. Further, to deal with the potential mismatch area during mask exchange, we designed a face inpainting network as post-processing. The extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our E4S outperforms existing methods in preserving texture, shape, and lighting.

Recently the emerging field of large language models (LLMs) research has shown that LLMs have the potential replicate human-like behavior in various tasks: in particular, LLMs outperform crowd workers on text-annotation tasks, suggesting an opportunity to leverage LLMs on TA. We propose a human-LLM collaboration framework (i.e., LLM-in-the-loop) to conduct TA with in-context learning (ICL). This framework provides the prompt to frame discussions with a LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) to generate the final codebook for TA.

In contrast, large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP demonstrate remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities. To enhance the performance of pre-trained models for downstream tasks, fine-tuning the model on downstream data is frequently necessary. However, fine-tuning the pre-trained model leads to a decrease in its generalizability in the presence of distribution shift, while the limited number of samples in few-shot learning makes the model highly susceptible to overfitting. Consequently, existing methods for fine-tuning few-shot learning primarily focus on fine-tuning the model's classification head or introducing additional structure. In this paper, we introduce a fine-tuning approach termed Feature Discrimination Alignment (FD-Align). Our method aims to bolster the model's generalizability by preserving the consistency of spurious features across the fine-tuning process. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach for both ID and OOD tasks.

In addition, MDM enables a progressive training schedule from lower to higher resolutions, which leads to significant improvements in optimization for high-resolution generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmarks, including class-conditioned image generation, high-resolution text-to-image, and text-to-video applications.

        "abstract": "At the core of causal inference lies the challenge of determining reliable causal graphs solely based on observational data. Since the well-known backdoor criterion depends on the graph, any errors in the graph can propagate downstream to effect inference. In this work, we initially show that complete graph information is not necessary for causal effect inference; the topological order over graph variables (causal order) alone suffices. Further, given a node pair, causal order is easier to elicit from domain experts compared to graph edges since determining the existence of an edge can depend extensively on other variables. Interestingly, we find that the same principle holds for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, motivating an automated method to obtain causal order (and hence causal effect) with LLMs acting as virtual domain experts. To this end, we employ different prompting strategies and contextual cues to propose a robust technique of obtaining causal order from LLMs. Acknowledging LLMs' limitations, we also study possible techniques to integrate LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms, including constraint-based and score-based methods, to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves causal ordering accuracy as compared to discovery algorithms, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance causal inference across diverse fields.

It consists of branch, solve, and merge modules that are parameterized with specific prompts to the base LLM. These three modules plan a decomposition of the task into multiple parallel sub-tasks, independently solve them, and fuse the solutions to the sub-tasks. We apply our method to the tasks of LLM response evaluation and constrained text generation and evaluate its effectiveness with multiple LLMs, including Vicuna, LLaMA-2-chat, and GPT-4. BSM improves the evaluation correctness and consistency for each LLM by enhancing human-LLM agreement by up to 26%, reducing length and pairwise position biases by up to 50%, and allowing LLaMA-2-chat to match or outperform GPT-4 on most domains. On the constraint story generation task, BSM improves the coherence of the stories while also improving constraint satisfaction by 12%. "

        "abstract": "Pre-trained and frozen LLMs can effectively map simple scene re-arrangement instructions to programs over a robot's visuomotor functions through appropriate few-shot example prompting. To parse open-domain natural language and adapt to a user's idiosyncratic procedures, not known during prompt engineering time, fixed prompts fall short. In this paper, we introduce HELPER, an embodied agent equipped with an external memory of language-program pairs that parses free-form human-robot dialogue into action programs through retrieval-augmented LLM prompting: relevant memories are retrieved based on the current dialogue, instruction, correction or VLM description, and used as in-context prompt examples for LLM querying. The memory is expanded during deployment to include pairs of user's language and action plans, to assist future inferences and personalize them to the user's language and routines. HELPER sets a new state-of-the-art in the TEACh benchmark in both Execution from Dialog History (EDH) and Trajectory from Dialogue (TfD), with 1.7x improvement over the previous SOTA for TfD.

Additionally, past studies have mainly been conducted in a monolingual context, so cross-linguistic trends have not been identified and tied to external factors. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the most influential, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across two high-use applications, machine translation and automatic speech recognition, to assess their functionality on the regional dialects of several high- and low-resource languages. Additionally, we analyze how the regional dialect gap is correlated with economic, social, and linguistic factors. The impact of training data, including related factors like dataset size and its construction procedure, is shown to be significant but not consistent across models or languages, meaning a one-size-fits-all approach cannot be taken in solving the dialect gap. This work will lay the foundation for furthering the field of dialectal NLP by laying out evident disparities and identifying possible pathways for addressing them through mindful data collection. "

        "abstract": "Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be compromised with manual jailbreak attacks and (automatic) adversarial attacks. Recent work suggests that patching LLMs against these attacks is possible: manual jailbreak attacks are human-readable but often limited and public, making them easy to block; adversarial attacks generate gibberish prompts that can be detected using perplexity-based filters. In this paper, we show that these solutions may be too optimistic. We propose an interpretable adversarial attack, \\texttt{AutoDAN}, that combines the strengths of both types of attacks. It automatically generates attack prompts that bypass perplexity-based filters while maintaining a high attack success rate like manual jailbreak attacks. These prompts are interpretable and diverse, exhibiting strategies commonly used in manual jailbreak attacks, and transfer better than their non-readable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. We also customize \\texttt{AutoDAN}'s objective to leak system prompts, another jailbreak application not addressed in the adversarial attack literature. %, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. We can also customize the objective of \\texttt{AutoDAN} to leak system prompts, beyond the ability to elicit harmful content from the model, demonstrating the versatility of the approach.

Recent T2I models like DALL-E 3 and others, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating photorealistic images that align closely with textual inputs. While the allure of creating visually captivating images is undeniable, our emphasis extends beyond mere aesthetic pleasure. We aim to investigate the potential of using these powerful models in authentic design contexts. In pursuit of this goal, we develop DEsignBench, which incorporates test samples designed to assess T2I models on both \"design technical capability\" and \"design application scenario.\" Each of these two dimensions is supported by a diverse set of specific design categories. We explore DALL-E 3 together with other leading T2I models on DEsignBench, resulting in a comprehensive visual gallery for side-by-side comparisons. For DEsignBench benchmarking, we perform human evaluations on generated images in DEsignBench gallery, against the criteria of image-text alignment, visual aesthetic, and design creativity. Our evaluation also considers other specialized design capabilities, including text rendering, layout composition, color harmony, 3D design, and medium style.

        "abstract": "The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to great strides in model capabilities like reasoning and long-context understanding. However, as LLMs are able to process longer contexts, it becomes more challenging to evaluate whether they have acquired certain capabilities, since the length of text (e.g., 100K tokens) they can process far exceeds what humans can reliably assess in a reasonable duration. In this paper, we propose using complex synthetic tasks as a proxy evaluation method, and present S3Eval, a Synthetic, Scalable, Systematic evaluation suite for LLMs evaluation. As a synthetic benchmark, S3Eval enables the creation of any number of evaluation examples that are theoretically invisible to LLMs, mitigating the test set contamination issue. The synthetic nature of S3Eval provides users full control over the dataset, allowing them to systematically probe LLM capabilities by scaling text length and varying task difficulty across diverse scenarios. The strong correlation between S3Eval performance and scores of real-world benchmarks like Big-Bench Hard (BBH) demonstrates the soundness of using S3Eval for evaluation of LLMs. The in-depth analysis also uncover additional insights, including performance drop when the answer is sparsely distributed or located in the middle context, as well as some counter-intuitive trends of model performance.

In this paper, we propose TabToken, a method aims at enhancing the quality of feature tokens (i.e., embeddings of tabular features). TabToken allows for the utilization of pre-trained models when the upstream and downstream tasks share overlapping features, facilitating model fine-tuning even with limited training examples. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive objective that regularizes the tokens, capturing the semantics within and across features. During the pre-training stage, the tokens are learned jointly with top-layer deep models such as transformer. In the downstream task, tokens of the shared features are kept fixed while TabToken efficiently fine-tunes the remaining parts of the model. TabToken not only enables knowledge transfer from a pre-trained model to tasks with heterogeneous features, but also enhances the discriminative ability of deep tabular models in standard classification and regression tasks.

Through causal interventions, we isolate this direction and show it is causally relevant in both toy tasks and real world datasets such as Stanford Sentiment Treebank. Through this case study we model a thorough investigation of what a single direction means on a broad data distribution. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15164",
        "abstract": "Logical reasoning, i.e., deductively inferring the truth value of a conclusion from a set of premises, is an important task for artificial intelligence with wide potential impacts on science, mathematics, and society. While many prompting-based strategies have been proposed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to do such reasoning more effectively, they still appear unsatisfactory, often failing in subtle and unpredictable ways. In this work, we investigate the validity of instead reformulating such tasks as modular neurosymbolic programming, which we call LINC: Logical Inference via Neurosymbolic Computation. In LINC, the LLM acts as a semantic parser, translating premises and conclusions from natural language to expressions in first-order logic. These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem prover, which symbolically performs deductive inference. Leveraging this approach, we observe significant performance gains on FOLIO and a balanced subset of ProofWriter for three different models in nearly all experimental conditions we evaluate. On ProofWriter, augmenting the comparatively small open-source StarCoder+ (15.5B parameters) with LINC even outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by an absolute 38% and 10%, respectively. When used with GPT-4, LINC scores 26% higher than CoT on ProofWriter while performing comparatively on FOLIO. Further analysis reveals that although both methods on average succeed roughly equally often on this dataset, they exhibit distinct and complementary failure modes. We thus provide promising evidence for how logical reasoning over natural language can be tackled through jointly leveraging LLMs alongside symbolic provers.

        "abstract": "Visual reasoning requires multimodal perception and commonsense cognition of the world. Recently, multiple vision-language models (VLMs) have been proposed with excellent commonsense reasoning ability in various domains. However, how to harness the collective power of these complementary VLMs is rarely explored. Existing methods like ensemble still struggle to aggregate these models with the desired higher-order communications. In this work, we propose Cola, a novel paradigm that coordinates multiple VLMs for visual reasoning. Our key insight is that a large language model (LLM) can efficiently coordinate multiple VLMs by facilitating natural language communication that leverages their distinct and complementary capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our instruction tuning variant, Cola-FT, achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual question answering (VQA), outside knowledge VQA, visual entailment, and visual spatial reasoning tasks. Moreover, we show that our in-context learning variant, Cola-Zero, exhibits competitive performance in zero and few-shot settings, without finetuning. Through systematic ablation studies and visualizations, we validate that a coordinator LLM indeed comprehends the instruction prompts as well as the separate functionalities of VLMs; it then coordinates them to enable impressive visual reasoning capabilities.

        "abstract": "With the availability of large-scale video datasets and the advances of diffusion models, text-driven video generation has achieved substantial progress. However, existing video generation models are typically trained on a limited number of frames, resulting in the inability to generate high-fidelity long videos during inference. Furthermore, these models only support single-text conditions, whereas real-life scenarios often require multi-text conditions as the video content changes over time. To tackle these challenges, this study explores the potential of extending the text-driven capability to generate longer videos conditioned on multiple texts. 1) We first analyze the impact of initial noise in video diffusion models. Then building upon the observation of noise, we propose FreeNoise, a tuning-free and time-efficient paradigm to enhance the generative capabilities of pretrained video diffusion models while preserving content consistency. Specifically, instead of initializing noises for all frames, we reschedule a sequence of noises for long-range correlation and perform temporal attention over them by window-based function. 2) Additionally, we design a novel motion injection method to support the generation of videos conditioned on multiple text prompts. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. It is noteworthy that compared with the previous best-performing method which brought about 255% extra time cost, our method incurs only negligible time cost of approximately 17%.

        "abstract": "Nuclei segmentation is a fundamental but challenging task in the quantitative analysis of histopathology images. Although fully-supervised deep learning-based methods have made significant progress, a large number of labeled images are required to achieve great segmentation performance. Considering that manually labeling all nuclei instances for a dataset is inefficient, obtaining a large-scale human-annotated dataset is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, augmenting a dataset with only a few labeled images to improve the segmentation performance is of significant research and application value. In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based augmentation method for nuclei segmentation. The idea is to synthesize a large number of labeled images to facilitate training the segmentation model. To achieve this, we propose a two-step strategy. In the first step, we train an unconditional diffusion model to synthesize the Nuclei Structure that is defined as the representation of pixel-level semantic and distance transform. Each synthetic nuclei structure will serve as a constraint on histopathology image synthesis and is further post-processed to be an instance map. In the second step, we train a conditioned diffusion model to synthesize histopathology images based on nuclei structures. The synthetic histopathology images paired with synthetic instance maps will be added to the real dataset for training the segmentation model. The experimental results show that by augmenting 10% labeled real dataset with synthetic samples, one can achieve comparable segmentation results with the fully-supervised baseline. "

To address this issue, we propose a Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification (DAP) method that enhances the robustness of ASV systems against such adversarial attacks. Our method leverages a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to effectively purify the adversarial examples and mitigate the impact of perturbations. DAP first introduces controlled noise into adversarial examples, and then performs a reverse denoising process to reconstruct clean audio. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DAP in enhancing the security of ASV and meanwhile minimizing the distortion of the purified audio signals. "

MFCCGAN_36k achieved the state-of-the-art result in terms of SNR despite a lower bitrate in comparison to AC3_128k, AAC_112k, Vorbis_48k, Opus_48k, and Speex_48K.

MFCCGAN_36k achieved higher NISQA-MOS results compared to AAC_48k while having a 20% lower bitrate.

We first introduce an efficient procedure for creating large numbers of isomorphic physics problems, assisted by the large language model GPT-3 and several other open-source tools. We then propose that if exam items are randomly drawn from large enough problem banks, then giving students open access to problem banks prior to the exam will not dramatically impact students' performance on the exam or lead to wide-spread rote-memorization of solutions. We tested this hypothesis on two mid-term physics exams, comparing students' performance on problems drawn from open isomorphic problem banks to similar transfer problems that were not accessible to students prior to the exam. We found that on both exams, both open bank and transfer problems had the highest difficulty. The differences in percent correct were between 5% to 10%, which is comparable to the differences between different isomorphic versions of the same problem type. Item response theory analysis found that both types of problem have high discrimination (>1.5) with no significant differences. Student performance on open-bank and transfer problems are highly correlated with each other, and the correlations are stronger than average correlations between problems on the exam. Exploratory factor analysis also found that open-bank and transfer problems load on the same factor, and even formed their own factor on the second exam. Those observations all suggest that giving students open access to large isomorphic problem banks only had a small impact on students' performance on the exam but could have significant potential in reforming traditional classroom exams.
