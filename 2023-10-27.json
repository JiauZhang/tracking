        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16856",
        "abstract": "Object Re-Identification (ReID) is pivotal in computer vision, witnessing an escalating demand for adept multimodal representation learning. Current models, although promising, reveal scalability limitations with increasing modalities as they rely heavily on late fusion, which postpones the integration of specific modality insights. Addressing this, we introduce the \\textbf{Gradual Fusion Transformer (GraFT)} for multimodal ReID. At its core, GraFT employs learnable fusion tokens that guide self-attention across encoders, adeptly capturing both modality-specific and object-specific features. Further bolstering its efficacy, we introduce a novel training paradigm combined with an augmented triplet loss, optimizing the ReID feature embedding space. We demonstrate these enhancements through extensive ablation studies and show that GraFT consistently surpasses established multimodal ReID benchmarks. Additionally, aiming for deployment versatility, we've integrated neural network pruning into GraFT, offering a balance between model size and performance. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16858",
        "abstract": "This paper targets interactive object-level editing(e.g., deletion, recoloring, transformation, composition) in dynamic scenes. Recently, some methods aiming for flexible editing static scenes represented by neural radiance field (NeRF) have shown impressive synthesis quality, while similar capabilities in time-variant dynamic scenes remain limited. To solve this problem, we propose 4D-Editor, an interactive semantic-driven editing framework, allowing editing multiple objects in dynamic NeRF based on user strokes on a single frame. Our dynamic scene representation is built upon hybrid semantic feature fields so that the spatial-temporal consistency can be maintained after editing. In addition, we design recursive selection refinement that significantly boosts segmentation accuracy in a dynamic NeRF to aid the editing process. Moreover, we develop multi-view reprojection inpainting to fill holes caused by incomplete scene capture after editing. Extensive experiments and editing examples on real-world demonstrate that 4D-Editor achieves photo-realistic dynamic NeRF editing. Project page: https://patrickddj.github.io/4D-Editor "

        "abstract": "The pre-training architectures of large language models encompass various types, including autoencoding models, autoregressive models, and encoder-decoder models. We posit that any modality can potentially benefit from a large language model, as long as it undergoes vector quantization to become discrete tokens. Inspired by GLM, we propose a General Point Model (GPM) which seamlessly integrates autoencoding and autoregressive tasks in point cloud transformer. This model is versatile, allowing fine-tuning for downstream point cloud representation tasks, as well as unconditional and conditional generation tasks. GPM enhances masked prediction in autoencoding through various forms of mask padding tasks, leading to improved performance in point cloud understanding. Additionally, GPM demonstrates highly competitive results in unconditional point cloud generation tasks, even exhibiting the potential for conditional generation tasks by modifying the input's conditional information. Compared to models like Point-BERT, MaskPoint and PointMAE, our GPM achieves superior performance in point cloud understanding tasks. Furthermore, the integration of autoregressive and autoencoding within the same transformer underscores its versatility across different downstream tasks. "

Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0\\% improvement in accuracy reaching up to 99.0\\% and yielded a lower loss value as well as a faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.

A key to supporting application-specific requirements is the ability to fine-tune. However, compiling a fine-tuning dataset tailored to complex tasks is tedious and results in large datasets, limiting the ability to control transformer output. We present an approach in which complex tasks are divided into simpler subtasks. Multiple transformer models are fine-tuned to one subtask each, and lined up to accomplish the complex task. This simplifies the compilation of fine-tuning datasets and increases overall controllability. Using the example of reducing gender bias as a complex task, we demonstrate our approach and show that it performs better than using a single model. "

Conventional methods successfully enable convolutional neural network inference of high resolution images on microcontrollers, while the framework for vision transformers that achieve the state-of-the-art performance in many vision applications still remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method called MCUFormer to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory, where we jointly design transformer architecture and construct the inference operator library to fit the memory resource constraint. More specifically, we generalize the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the microcontrollers, where we enlarge the existing search space of vision transformers by considering the low-rank decomposition dimensions and patch resolution for memory reduction. For the construction of the inference operator library of vision transformers, we schedule the memory buffer during inference through operator integration, patch embedding decomposition, and token overwriting, allowing the memory buffer to be fully utilized to adapt to the forward pass of the vision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that our MCUFormer achieves 73.62\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for image classification with 320KB memory on STM32F746 microcontroller.

        "abstract": "We propose a novel multi-bit box-free watermarking method for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of GANs with improved robustness against white-box attacks like fine-tuning, pruning, quantization, and surrogate model attacks. The watermark is embedded by adding an extra watermarking loss term during GAN training, ensuring that the images generated by the GAN contain an invisible watermark that can be retrieved by a pre-trained watermark decoder. In order to improve the robustness against white-box model-level attacks, we make sure that the model converges to a wide flat minimum of the watermarking loss term, in such a way that any modification of the model parameters does not erase the watermark. To do so, we add random noise vectors to the parameters of the generator and require that the watermarking loss term is as invariant as possible with respect to the presence of noise. This procedure forces the generator to converge to a wide flat minimum of the watermarking loss. The proposed method is architectureand dataset-agnostic, thus being applicable to many different generation tasks and models, as well as to CNN-based image processing architectures. We present the results of extensive experiments showing that the presence of the watermark has a negligible impact on the quality of the generated images, and proving the superior robustness of the watermark against model modification and surrogate model attacks.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently become remarkably good at improving developer productivity for high-resource programming languages. These models use two kinds of data: large amounts of unlabeled code samples for pretraining and relatively smaller amounts of labeled code samples for fine-tuning or in-context learning. Unfortunately, many programming languages are low-resource, lacking labeled samples for most tasks and often even lacking unlabeled samples. Therefore, users of low-resource languages (e.g., legacy or new languages) miss out on the benefits of LLMs. Cross-lingual transfer learning uses data from a source language to improve model performance on a target language. It has been well-studied for natural languages, but has received little attention for programming languages. This paper reports extensive experiments on four tasks using a transformer-based LLM and 11 to 41 programming languages to explore the following questions. First, how well cross-lingual transfer works for a given task across different language pairs. Second, given a task and target language, how to best choose a source language. Third, the characteristics of a language pair that are predictive of transfer performance, and fourth, how that depends on the given task. "

In this work, we show that using transformers pretrained on small molecules and fine-tuned on polymer properties achieve comparable accuracy to those trained on augmented polymer datasets for a series of benchmark prediction tasks.

In this paper, we study the novel setting of domain-generalized few-shot learning for LLM-based text safety classifiers. Unlike prior few-shot work, these new safety issues can be hard to uncover and we do not get to choose the few examples. We demonstrate that existing few-shot techniques do not perform well in this setting, and rather we propose to do parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) combined with augmenting training data based on similar examples in prior existing rules. We empirically show that our approach of similarity-based data-augmentation + prompt-tuning (DAPT) consistently outperforms baselines that either do not rely on data augmentation or on PEFT by 7-17% F1 score in the Social Chemistry moral judgement and 9-13% AUC in the Toxicity detection tasks, even when the new rule is loosely correlated with existing ones.

Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students' use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course ($n = 52$), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools. "

A realistic facial animation system should consider such identity-specific speaking styles and facial idiosyncrasies to achieve high-degree of naturalness and plausibility. Existing approaches to personalized speech-driven 3D facial animation either use one-hot identity labels or rely-on person specific models which limit their scalability. We present a personalized speech-driven expressive 3D facial animation synthesis framework that models identity specific facial motion as latent representations (called as styles), and synthesizes novel animations given a speech input with the target style for various emotion categories. Our framework is trained in an end-to-end fashion and has a non-autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture with three main components: expression encoder, speech encoder and expression decoder. Since, expressive facial motion includes both identity-specific style and speech-related content information; expression encoder first disentangles facial motion sequences into style and content representations, respectively. Then, both of the speech encoder and the expression decoders input the extracted style information to update transformer layer weights during training phase. Our speech encoder also extracts speech phoneme label and duration information to achieve better synchrony within the non-autoregressive synthesis mechanism more effectively. Through detailed experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces temporally coherent facial expressions from input speech while preserving the speaking styles of the target identities. "

In this work, we studied the impact of data augmentation techniques precisely when applied to small imbalanced datasets, for which current state-of-the-art models (such as RoBERTa) under-perform. Specifically, we utilized four data augmentation methods (Easy Data Augmentation EDA, static and contextual Embedding-based, and ProtAugment) on three datasets that come from different sources and vary in size, emotion categories and distributions. Our experimental results show that using the augmented data when training the classifier model leads to significant improvements. Finally, we conducted two case studies: a) directly using the popular chat-GPT API to paraphrase text using different prompts, and b) using external data to augment the training set. Results show the promising potential of these methods. "

However, amidst their successes, a crucial issue persists: their generated outputs still lack commonsense at times. Moreover, fine-tuning the entire LLM towards more commonsensical outputs is computationally expensive if not infeasible. In this paper, we present a computation-efficient framework that steers a frozen Pre-Trained Language Model (PTLM) towards more commonsensical generation (i.e., producing a plausible output that incorporates a list of concepts in a meaningful way). Specifically, we first construct a reference-free evaluator that assigns a sentence with a commonsensical score by grounding the sentence to a dynamic commonsense knowledge base from four different relational aspects. We then use the scorer as the oracle for commonsense knowledge, and extend the controllable generation method called NADO to train an auxiliary head that guides a fixed PTLM to better satisfy the oracle. We test our framework on a series of GPT-2-, Flan-T5-, and Alpaca-based language models (LMs) on two constrained concept-to-sentence benchmarks. Human evaluation results demonstrate that our method consistently leads to the most commonsensical outputs. "

These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes -- either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based methods. Our ablation experiments show that both the dynamic architecture and NeRF distillation are critical to the expressivity of HyperFields. "

If the patient is parkinsonian, a multi-class Hybrid ConvNet-Transformer model determines the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) score to assess the PD severity stage. Our hybrid architecture exploits the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and Transformers to accurately detect PD and determine the severity stage. In particular, we take advantage of ConvNets to capture local patterns and correlations in the data, while we exploit Transformers for handling long-term dependencies in the input signal.

        "abstract": "Transformers are remarkably good at in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from demonstrations without parameter updates -- but how they perform ICL remains a mystery. Recent work suggests that Transformers may learn in-context by internally running Gradient Descent, a first-order optimization method. In this paper, we instead demonstrate that Transformers learn to implement higher-order optimization methods to perform ICL. Focusing on in-context linear regression, we show that Transformers learn to implement an algorithm very similar to Iterative Newton's Method, a higher-order optimization method, rather than Gradient Descent. Empirically, we show that predictions from successive Transformer layers closely match different iterations of Newton's Method linearly, with each middle layer roughly computing 3 iterations. In contrast, exponentially more Gradient Descent steps are needed to match an additional Transformers layer; this suggests that Transformers have an comparable rate of convergence with high-order methods such as Iterative Newton, which are exponentially faster than Gradient Descent. We also show that Transformers can learn in-context on ill-conditioned data, a setting where Gradient Descent struggles but Iterative Newton succeeds. Finally, we show theoretical results which support our empirical findings and have a close correspondence with them: we prove that Transformers can implement $k$ iterations of Newton's method with $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ layers.

While overt attacks that force vehicles to collide may be easily identified, more insidious attacks, which only slightly alter driving behavior, can result in network-wide increases in congestion, fuel consumption, and even crash risk without being easily detected. To address the detection of such attacks, we first present a traffic model framework for three types of potential cyberattacks: malicious manipulation of vehicle control commands, false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We then investigate the impacts of these attacks at both the individual vehicle (micro) and traffic flow (macro) levels. A novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based anomaly detection model is proposed for real-time identification of such attacks using vehicle trajectory data. We provide numerical evidence {to demonstrate} the efficacy of our machine learning approach in detecting cyberattacks on ACC-equipped vehicles. The proposed method is compared against some recently proposed neural network models and observed to have higher accuracy in identifying anomalous driving behaviors of ACC vehicles. "

A typical approach for OVOD is to use joint text-image embeddings of CLIP to assign box proposals to their closest text label. However, this method has a critical issue: many low-quality boxes, such as over- and under-covered-object boxes, have the same similarity score as high-quality boxes since CLIP is not trained on exact object location information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, LP-OVOD, that discards low-quality boxes by training a sigmoid linear classifier on pseudo labels retrieved from the top relevant region proposals to the novel text. Experimental results on COCO affirm the superior performance of our approach over the state of the art, achieving $\\textbf{40.5}$ in $\\text{AP}_{novel}$ using ResNet50 as the backbone and without external datasets or knowing novel classes during training.

Evaluating LLMs' competence in understanding spatial-temporal information on dynamic graphs is essential for their adoption in web applications, which remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we bridge the gap via proposing to evaluate LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time.

Our main observations are: 1) LLMs have preliminary spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, 2) Dynamic graph tasks show increasing difficulties for LLMs as the graph size and density increase, while not sensitive to the time span and data generation mechanism, 3) the proposed DST2 prompting method can help to improve LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs for most tasks.

Since manual detection and correction of factual errors is labor-intensive, developing an automatic approach can greatly reduce human effort. We present FLEEK, a prototype tool that automatically extracts factual claims from text, gathers evidence from external knowledge sources, evaluates the factuality of each claim, and suggests revisions for identified errors using the collected evidence. Initial empirical evaluation on fact error detection (77-85\\% F1) shows the potential of FLEEK. A video demo of FLEEK can be found at https://youtu.be/NapJFUlkPdQ. "

Recently, different flow-based NIDS designs utilizing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed as solutions to detect intrusions efficiently. However, conventional ML-based classifiers have not seen widespread adoption in the real world due to their poor domain adaptation capability. In this research, our goal is to explore the possibility of using sequences of flows to improve the domain adaptation capability of network intrusion detection systems. Our proposal employs natural language processing techniques and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers framework, which is an effective technique for modeling data with respect to its context. Early empirical results show that our approach has improved domain adaptation capability compared to previous approaches. The proposed approach provides a new research method for building a robust intrusion detection system. "

        "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth study of multimodal machine translation (MMT), examining the prevailing understanding that MMT systems exhibit decreased sensitivity to visual information when text inputs are complete. Instead, we attribute this phenomenon to insufficient cross-modal interaction, rather than image information redundancy. A novel approach is proposed to generate parallel Visual Question-Answering (VQA) style pairs from the source text, fostering more robust cross-modal interaction. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we explicitly model the probing signal in MMT to convert it into VQA-style data to create the Multi30K-VQA dataset. An MMT-VQA multitask learning framework is introduced to incorporate explicit probing signals from the dataset into the MMT training process. Experimental results on two widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach. Our code and data would be available at: \\url{https://github.com/libeineu/MMT-VQA}. "

Our system consists of a reader and planner: the reader leverages an LLM to convert partner utterances into executable code, calling functions that perform grounding. The translated code's output is stored to track dialogue state, while a symbolic planner determines the next appropriate response. We evaluate our system's performance on the demanding OneCommon dialogue task, involving collaborative reference resolution on abstract images of scattered dots.

This Perspective maps out principles and methods for using generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), to elevate the quality and efficiency of academic writing.

The framework pinpoints both short-term and long-term reasons for engagement and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., cognitive offloading and imaginative stimulation). It reveals the role of AI throughout the writing process, conceptualized through a two-stage model for human-AI collaborative writing, and the nature of AI assistance in writing, represented through a model of writing-assistance types and levels. Building on this framework, we describe effective prompting techniques for incorporating AI into the writing routine (outlining, drafting, and editing) as well as strategies for maintaining rigorous scholarship, adhering to varied journal policies, and avoiding overreliance on AI. Ultimately, the prudent integration of AI into academic writing can ease the communication burden, empower authors, accelerate discovery, and promote diversity in science. "

        "abstract": "Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) has been introduced to expand the analytical variational families by defining expressive semi-implicit distributions in a hierarchical manner. However, the single-layer architecture commonly used in current SIVI methods can be insufficient when the target posterior has complicated structures. In this paper, we propose hierarchical semi-implicit variational inference, called HSIVI, which generalizes SIVI to allow more expressive multi-layer construction of semi-implicit distributions. By introducing auxiliary distributions that interpolate between a simple base distribution and the target distribution, the conditional layers can be trained by progressively matching these auxiliary distributions one layer after another. Moreover, given pre-trained score networks, HSIVI can be used to accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models with the score matching objective. We show that HSIVI significantly enhances the expressiveness of SIVI on several Bayesian inference problems with complicated target distributions. When used for diffusion model acceleration, we show that HSIVI can produce high quality samples comparable to or better than the existing fast diffusion model based samplers with a small number of function evaluations on various datasets.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo LLM's in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in wall-clock time without compromising LLM's quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference latency of OPT-175B by over 2X compared to the state-of-the-art FasterTransformer, and over 6X compared to the widely used Hugging Face implementation, without compromising model quality.

Such models enable end-to-end generation of higher-quality music, and some allow conditioned generation using text descriptions. However, the control power of text controls on music is intrinsically limited, as they can only describe music indirectly through meta-data (such as singers and instruments) or high-level representations (such as genre and emotion). We aim to further equip the models with direct and content-based controls on innate music languages such as pitch, chords and drum track. To this end, we contribute Coco-Mulla, a content-based control method for music large language modeling. It uses a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method tailored for Transformer-based audio models. Experiments show that our approach achieved high-quality music generation with low-resource semi-supervised learning, tuning with less than 4% parameters compared to the original model and training on a small dataset with fewer than 300 songs. Moreover, our approach enables effective content-based controls, and we illustrate the control power via chords and rhythms, two of the most salient features of music audio. Furthermore, we show that by combining content-based controls and text descriptions, our system achieves flexible music variation generation and style transfer.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces two key contributions aimed at improving the speed and quality of images generated through inverse diffusion processes. The first contribution involves reparameterizing the diffusion process in terms of the angle on a quarter-circular arc between the image and noise, specifically setting the conventional $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}}=\\cos(\\eta)$. This reparameterization eliminates two singularities and allows for the expression of diffusion evolution as a well-behaved ordinary differential equation (ODE). In turn, this allows higher order ODE solvers such as Runge-Kutta methods to be used effectively. The second contribution is to directly estimate both the image ($\\mathbf{x}_0$) and noise ($\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$) using our network, which enables more stable calculations of the update step in the inverse diffusion steps, as accurate estimation of both the image and noise are crucial at different stages of the process. Together with these changes, our model achieves faster generation, with the ability to converge on high-quality images more quickly, and higher quality of the generated images, as measured by metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID), spatial Frechet Inception Distance (sFID), precision, and recall.

        "abstract": "Despite the success of transformers on various computer vision tasks, they suffer from excessive memory and computational cost. Some works present dynamic vision transformers to accelerate inference by pruning redundant tokens. A key to improving token pruning is using well-trained models as initialization for faster convergence and better performance. However, current base models usually adopt full image training, i.e., using full images as inputs and keeping the whole feature maps through the forward process, which causes inconsistencies with dynamic models that gradually reduce tokens, including calculation pattern, information amount and token selection strategy inconsistencies. Inspired by MAE which performs masking and reconstruction self-supervised task, we devise masked fine-tuning to bridge the gaps between pre-trained base models used for initialization and token pruning based dynamic vision transformers, by masking image patches and predicting the image class label based on left unmasked patches. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that base models via masked fine-tuning gain strong occlusion robustness and ability against information loss. With this better initialization, Dynamic ViT achieves higher accuracies, especially under large token pruning ratios (e.g., 81.9% vs. 81.3%, and 62.3% vs. 58.9% for DeiT based Dynamic ViT/0.8 and Dynamic ViT/0.3). Moreover, we apply our method into different token pruning based dynamic vision transformers, different pre-trained models and randomly initialized models to demonstrate the generalization ability. "

Existing methods typically select the best prediction from a set of predefined proposals or directly regress the target span in a single-shot manner, resulting in the absence of a systematical prediction refinement process. In this paper, we propose DiffusionVG, a novel framework with diffusion models that formulates video grounding as a conditional generation task, where the target span is generated from Gaussian noise inputs and interatively refined in the reverse diffusion process. During training, DiffusionVG progressively adds noise to the target span with a fixed forward diffusion process and learns to recover the target span in the reverse diffusion process. In inference, DiffusionVG can generate the target span from Gaussian noise inputs by the learned reverse diffusion process conditioned on the video-sentence representations. Our DiffusionVG follows the encoder-decoder architecture, which firstly encodes the video-sentence features and iteratively denoises the predicted spans in its specialized span refining decoder. Without bells and whistles, our DiffusionVG demonstrates competitive or even superior performance compared to existing well-crafted models on mainstream Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution that best explain the observed data. In the context of text generation, MLE is often used to train generative language models, which can then be used to generate new text. However, we argue that MLE is not always necessary and optimal, especially for closed-ended text generation tasks like machine translation. In these tasks, the goal of model is to generate the most appropriate response, which does not necessarily require it to estimate the entire data distribution with MLE. To this end, we propose a novel class of training objectives based on convex functions, which enables text generation models to focus on highly probable outputs without having to estimate the entire data distribution. We investigate the theoretical properties of the optimal predicted distribution when applying convex functions to the loss, demonstrating that convex functions can sharpen the optimal distribution, thereby enabling the model to better capture outputs with high probabilities. Experiments on various text generation tasks and models show the effectiveness of our approach. It enables autoregressive models to bridge the gap between greedy and beam search, and facilitates the learning of non-autoregressive models with a maximum improvement of 9+ BLEU points. Moreover, our approach also exhibits significant impact on large language models (LLMs), substantially enhancing their generative capability on various tasks.

First, we replace the sentence transformer with embeddings from a larger model, which reduces sensitivity to the language distribution and thus provides more flexibility in synthetic generation of examples, and we train a tiny model that transforms these embeddings to a space where embedding similarity matches code similarity, which allows the model to remain a black box and only requires a few matrix multiplications at inference time. Second, we how to efficiently select a smaller number of training examples to train the TST model.

        "abstract": "Understanding neural networks is challenging in part because of the dense, continuous nature of their hidden states. We explore whether we can train neural networks to have hidden states that are sparse, discrete, and more interpretable by quantizing their continuous features into what we call codebook features. Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

Can we capture this phenomenon using existing metrics? Unfortunately, we cannot, because these metrics do not provide any interpretability beyond \"diversity\". In this context, we propose a new evaluation protocol that measures the divergence of a set of generated images from the training set regarding the distribution of attribute strengths as follows. Single-attribute Divergence (SaD) measures the divergence regarding PDFs of a single attribute. Paired-attribute Divergence (PaD) measures the divergence regarding joint PDFs of a pair of attributes. They provide which attributes the models struggle. For measuring the attribute strengths of an image, we propose Heterogeneous CLIPScore (HCS) which measures the cosine similarity between image and text vectors with heterogeneous initial points. With SaD and PaD, we reveal the following about existing generative models. ProjectedGAN generates implausible attribute relationships such as a baby with a beard even though it has competitive scores of existing metrics. Diffusion models struggle to capture diverse colors in the datasets. The larger sampling timesteps of latent diffusion model generate the more minor objects including earrings and necklaces. Stable Diffusion v1.5 better captures the attributes than v2.1. Our metrics lay a foundation for explainable evaluations of generative models. "

Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically format their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF) rules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires them to understand and implement the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a transformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and a natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that user descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous, making it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired rule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and minimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an abstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model or, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a programming-by-example system. To evaluate FormaT5 on diverse and real scenarios, we create an extensive benchmark of 1053 CF tasks, containing real-world descriptions collected from four different sources. We release our benchmarks to encourage research in this area. Abstention and filling allow FormaT5 to outperform 8 different neural approaches on our benchmarks, both with and without examples.

To define the semantic goal space, our method discretizes continuous observations via vector quantized-variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and restores the temporal relations between the discretized observations by a graph. Concurrently, ours suggests uncertainty and temporal distance-aware curriculum goals that converges to the final goals over the automatically composed goal space.

Besides the trivial few-shot in-context learning setting, we design our chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt with a similar method to schema linking. We provide a method named ACT-SQL to automatically generate auto-CoT exemplars and thus the whole process doesn't need manual labeling. Our approach is cost-saving since we only use the LLMs' API call once when generating one SQL query. Furthermore, we extend our in-context learning method to the multi-turn text-to-SQL task. The experiment results show that the LLMs' performance can benefit from our ACT-SQL approach. Our approach achieves SOTA performance on the Spider dev set among existing in-context learning approaches. "

        "abstract": "While conditional diffusion models are known to have good coverage of the data distribution, they still face limitations in output diversity, particularly when sampled with a high classifier-free guidance scale for optimal image quality or when trained on small datasets. We attribute this problem to the role of the conditioning signal in inference and offer an improved sampling strategy for diffusion models that can increase generation diversity, especially at high guidance scales, with minimal loss of sample quality. Our sampling strategy anneals the conditioning signal by adding scheduled, monotonically decreasing Gaussian noise to the conditioning vector during inference to balance diversity and condition alignment. Our Condition-Annealed Diffusion Sampler (CADS) can be used with any pretrained model and sampling algorithm, and we show that it boosts the diversity of diffusion models in various conditional generation tasks. Further, using an existing pretrained diffusion model, CADS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.70 and 2.31 for class-conditional ImageNet generation at 256$\\times$256 and 512$\\times$512 respectively.

A key example is recipe adaptation, which goes beyond simple translation to include a grasp of ingredients, culinary techniques, and dietary preferences specific to a given culture. We introduce a new task involving the translation and cultural adaptation of recipes between Chinese and English-speaking cuisines. To support this investigation, we present CulturalRecipes, a unique dataset comprised of automatically paired recipes written in Mandarin Chinese and English. This dataset is further enriched with a human-written and curated test set. In this intricate task of cross-cultural recipe adaptation, we evaluate the performance of various methods, including GPT-4 and other LLMs, traditional machine translation, and information retrieval techniques. Our comprehensive analysis includes both automatic and human evaluation metrics. While GPT-4 exhibits impressive abilities in adapting Chinese recipes into English, it still lags behind human expertise when translating English recipes into Chinese. This underscores the multifaceted nature of cultural adaptations. We anticipate that these insights will significantly contribute to future research on culturally-aware language models and their practical application in culturally diverse contexts. "

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets. "

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in the Web of Things era, which enables a plethora of Web applications such as smart cities, human mobility and climate analysis. Existing approaches tackle different learning tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs limit their universality as general spatio-temporal learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model the learning tasks in a unified perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared spatio-temporal patterns. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly within the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising networks that are task-specific. The shared encoder, optimized by a pre-training strategy, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The denoising networks, utilizing both cross- and self-attention, integrate conditional dependencies and generate predictions. Opting for forecasting and kriging as downstream tasks, we design Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively. By combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic diffusion models, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to deterministic and probabilistic baselines in both tasks, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.

Between 2022 and 2023, generative AI surged in popularity with a plethora of applications spanning from AI-powered movies to chatbots. In this paper, we delve into the potential of generative AI within the realm of the World Wide Web, specifically focusing on image generation. Web developers already harness generative AI to help crafting text and images, while Web browsers might use it in the future to locally generate images for tasks like repairing broken webpages, conserving bandwidth, and enhancing privacy. To explore this research area, we have developed WebDiffusion, a tool that allows to simulate a Web powered by stable diffusion, a popular text-to-image model, from both a client and server perspective. WebDiffusion further supports crowdsourcing of user opinions, which we use to evaluate the quality and accuracy of 409 AI-generated images sourced from 60 webpages. Our findings suggest that generative AI is already capable of producing pertinent and high-quality Web images, even without requiring Web designers to manually input prompts, just by leveraging contextual information available within the webpages. However, we acknowledge that direct in-browser image generation remains a challenge, as only highly powerful GPUs, such as the A40 and A100, can (partially) compete with classic image downloads. Nevertheless, this approach could be valuable for a subset of the images, for example when fixing broken webpages or handling highly private content. "

In this paper we describe a system that addresses this issue by supporting an extended multimodal interaction: the user can follow up prior instructions with refinements or revisions, in reaction to the simulations that have been generated from their utterances so far. We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to map the user's English utterances in this interaction into domain-specific code, and so we explore the extent to which LLMs capture the context sensitivity that's necessary for computing the speaker's intended message in discourse.

We show that in several cases, they generalize to unseen interventions on their variables, often better than classical approaches. Our inference method is based on a new theoretical result that expresses a stationarity condition on the diffusion's generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The resulting kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS) is an objective function of independent interest. "

We show that the number of examples, the definition of labels, the presentation of the (labelled) textual context and specific questions about this context have a positive influence on the performance of the model. Given non-equivalent test set configurations, we observed that prompting with a few labelled examples from direct context can lead the model to a better performance than a supervised fined-tuned multi-class classifier based on the BERT encoder (weighted F1 score of = 72%).

Placement and routing are the most time-consuming parts of the physical design process, and how to quickly evaluate the placement has become a hot research topic. Prior works either transformed circuit designs into images using hand-crafted methods and then used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features, which are limited by the quality of the hand-crafted methods and could not achieve end-to-end training, or treated the circuit design as a graph structure and used Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to extract features, which require time-consuming preprocessing. In our work, we propose a novel perspective for circuit design by treating circuit components as point clouds and using Transformer-based point cloud perception methods to extract features from the circuit. This approach enables direct feature extraction from raw data without any preprocessing, allows for end-to-end training, and results in high performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in congestion prediction tasks on both the CircuitNet and ISPD2015 datasets, as well as in design rule check (DRC) violation prediction tasks on the CircuitNet dataset. Our method establishes a bridge between the relatively mature point cloud perception methods and the fast-developing EDA algorithms, enabling us to leverage more collective intelligence to solve this task.

Prior work often treats gender bias as a binary classification task. However, acknowledging that bias must be perceived at a relative scale; we investigate the generation and consequent receptivity of manual annotators to bias of varying degrees. Specifically, we create the first dataset of GPT-generated English text with normative ratings of gender bias. Ratings were obtained using Best--Worst Scaling -- an efficient comparative annotation framework. Next, we systematically analyze the variation of themes of gender biases in the observed ranking and show that identity-attack is most closely related to gender bias.

While advanced deep learning models require large amounts of high-resolution data for accurate short-term load predictions, fine-grained load profiles can expose users' electricity consumption behaviors, which raises privacy and security concerns. One solution to improve data privacy is federated learning, where models are trained locally on private data, and only the trained model parameters are merged and updated on a global server. Therefore, this paper presents a novel transformer-based deep learning approach with federated learning for short-term electricity load prediction. To evaluate our results, we benchmark our federated learning architecture against central and local learning and compare the performance of our model to long short-term memory models and convolutional neural networks. Our simulations are based on a dataset from a German university campus and show that transformer-based forecasting is a promising alternative to state-of-the-art models within federated learning. "

        "abstract": "This paper presents LightLM, a lightweight Transformer-based language model for generative recommendation. While Transformer-based generative modeling has gained importance in various AI sub-fields such as NLP and vision, generative recommendation is still in its infancy due to its unique demand on personalized generative modeling. Existing works on generative recommendation often use NLP-oriented Transformer architectures such as T5, GPT, LLaMA and M6, which are heavy-weight and are not specifically designed for recommendation tasks. LightLM tackles the issue by introducing a light-weight deep and narrow Transformer architecture, which is specifically tailored for direct generation of recommendation items. This structure is especially apt for straightforward generative recommendation and stems from the observation that language model does not have to be too wide for this task, as the input predominantly consists of short tokens that are well-suited for the model's capacity. We also show that our devised user and item ID indexing methods, i.e., Spectral Collaborative Indexing (SCI) and Graph Collaborative Indexing (GCI), enables the deep and narrow Transformer architecture to outperform large-scale language models for recommendation. Besides, to address the hallucination problem of generating items as output, we propose the constrained generation process for generative recommenders. Experiments on real-world datasets show that LightLM outperforms various competitive baselines in terms of both recommendation accuracy and efficiency.

When screening full-text literature using highly reliable prompts, GPT-4's performance was 'almost perfect.' Penalising GPT-4 for missing key studies using highly reliable prompts improved its performance even more.

This is in contrast to existing LLM-based robotic systems, which only follow verbal commands or corrections but not learn from them. We demonstrate the efficacy of our design in experiments where a user teaches a robot to perform long-horizon manipulation tasks both in simulation and on physical hardware, achieving on average 20.0% improvement in policy success rate.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of matching semantically similar keypoints across image pairs. Existing research indicates that the intermediate output of the UNet within the Stable Diffusion (SD) can serve as robust image feature maps for such a matching task. We demonstrate that by employing a basic prompt tuning technique, the inherent potential of Stable Diffusion can be harnessed, resulting in a significant enhancement in accuracy over previous approaches. We further introduce a novel conditional prompting module that conditions the prompt on the local details of the input image pairs, leading to a further improvement in performance. We designate our approach as SD4Match, short for Stable Diffusion for Semantic Matching. Comprehensive evaluations of SD4Match on the PF-Pascal, PF-Willow, and SPair-71k datasets show that it sets new benchmarks in accuracy across all these datasets. Particularly, SD4Match outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a margin of 12 percentage points on the challenging SPair-71k dataset. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17570",
        "abstract": "While Diffusion Generative Models have achieved great success on image generation tasks, how to efficiently and effectively incorporate them into speech generation especially translation tasks remains a non-trivial problem. Specifically, due to the low information density of speech data, the transformed discrete speech unit sequence is much longer than the corresponding text transcription, posing significant challenges to existing auto-regressive models. Furthermore, it is not optimal to brutally apply discrete diffusion on the speech unit sequence while disregarding the continuous space structure, which will degrade the generation performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model by applying the diffusion forward process in the \\textit{continuous} speech representation space, while employing the diffusion backward process in the \\textit{discrete} speech unit space. In this way, we preserve the semantic structure of the continuous speech representation space in the diffusion process and integrate the continuous and discrete diffusion models. We conduct extensive experiments on the textless direct speech-to-speech translation task, where the proposed method achieves comparable results to the computationally intensive auto-regressive baselines (500 steps on average) with significantly fewer decoding steps (50 steps).

        "abstract": "This paper studies a diffusion-based framework to address the low-light image enhancement problem. To harness the capabilities of diffusion models, we delve into this intricate process and advocate for the regularization of its inherent ODE-trajectory. To be specific, inspired by the recent research that low curvature ODE-trajectory results in a stable and effective diffusion process, we formulate a curvature regularization term anchored in the intrinsic non-local structures of image data, i.e., global structure-aware regularization, which gradually facilitates the preservation of complicated details and the augmentation of contrast during the diffusion process. This incorporation mitigates the adverse effects of noise and artifacts resulting from the diffusion process, leading to a more precise and flexible enhancement. To additionally promote learning in challenging regions, we introduce an uncertainty-guided regularization technique, which wisely relaxes constraints on the most extreme regions of the image. Experimental evaluations reveal that the proposed diffusion-based framework, complemented by rank-informed regularization, attains distinguished performance in low-light enhancement. The outcomes indicate substantial advancements in image quality, noise suppression, and contrast amplification in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. We believe this innovative approach will stimulate further exploration and advancement in low-light image processing, with potential implications for other applications of diffusion models.

It allows models to \"cheat\" via memorisation instead of displaying true capabilities. Therefore, contamination analysis has became an crucial part of reliable model evaluation to validate results. However, existing contamination analysis is usually conducted internally by LLM developers and often lacks transparency and completeness. This paper present an open source data contamination reports for the Llama series models. We analyse six popular multi-choice QA benchmarks and quantify their overlapping with the training set of Llama. Various levels of contamination ranging from 1\\% to 8.7\\% are found across benchmarks. Our comparison also reveals that Llama models can gain over 5\\% higher accuracy on contaminated subsets versus clean subsets.

In this paper, we reexamine the SDS process and introduce a straightforward interpretation that demystifies the necessity for large Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scales, rooted in the distillation of an undesired noise term. Building upon our interpretation, we propose a novel Noise-Free Score Distillation (NFSD) process, which requires minimal modifications to the original SDS framework. Through this streamlined design, we achieve more effective distillation of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models while using a nominal CFG scale. This strategic choice allows us to prevent the over-smoothing of results, ensuring that the generated data is both realistic and complies with the desired prompt. To demonstrate the efficacy of NFSD, we provide qualitative examples that compare NFSD and SDS, as well as several other methods. "

We pretrained our masked language models with three ingredients: an initial pretraining with music data, training on shorter sequences before training on longer ones, and masking specific tokens to target some of the BLiMP subtasks. Overall, our baseline models performed above chance, but far below the performance levels of larger LLMs trained on more data. We found that training on short sequences performed better than training on longer sequences.Pretraining on music may help performance marginally, but, if so, the effect seems small. Our targeted Masked Language Modeling augmentation did not seem to improve model performance in general, but did seem to help on some of the specific BLiMP tasks that we were targeting (e.g., Negative Polarity Items). Training performant LLMs on small amounts of data is a difficult but potentially informative task. While some of our techniques showed some promise, more work is needed to explore whether they can improve performance more than the modest gains here.

        "abstract": "Instruction-based language modeling has received significant attention in pretrained language models. However, the efficiency of instruction engineering remains low and hinders the development of instruction studies. Recent studies have focused on automating instruction generation, but they primarily aim to improve performance without considering other crucial objectives that impact instruction quality, such as instruction length and perplexity. Therefore, we propose a novel approach (i.e., InstOptima) that treats instruction generation as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem. In contrast to text edition-based methods, our approach utilizes a large language model (LLM) to simulate instruction operators, including mutation and crossover. Furthermore, we introduce an objective-guided mechanism for these operators, allowing the LLM to comprehend the objectives and enhance the quality of the generated instructions. Experimental results demonstrate improved fine-tuning performance and the generation of a diverse set of high-quality instructions. "

        "abstract": "Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging because existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively. To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs. JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement. JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, and multi-turn chat. "

The Hurst index $H\\in(0,1)$ of FBM enables control of the roughness of the distribution transforming path. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a generative model upon a stochastic process with infinite quadratic variation. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on huge corpora of text datasets demonstrate complex, emergent capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained for. The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a Cognitive Interpretability framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts in LLMs underlying behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate pseudo-random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from pseudo-random behaviors to deterministic repetition.

        "abstract": "A core capability for robot manipulation is reasoning over where and how to stably place objects in cluttered environments. Traditionally, robots have relied on object-specific, hand-crafted heuristics in order to perform such reasoning, with limited generalizability beyond a small number of object instances and object interaction patterns. Recent approaches instead learn notions of physical interaction, namely motion prediction, but require supervision in the form of labeled object information or come at the cost of high sample complexity, and do not directly reason over stability or object placement. We present 6-DoFusion, a generative model capable of generating 3D poses of an object that produces a stable configuration of a given scene. Underlying 6-DoFusion is a diffusion model that incrementally refines a randomly initialized SE(3) pose to generate a sample from a learned, context-dependent distribution over stable poses. We evaluate our model on different object placement and stacking tasks, demonstrating its ability to construct stable scenes that involve novel object classes as well as to improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation methods.

        "abstract": "As the peak of the solar cycle approaches in 2025 and the ability of a single geomagnetic storm to significantly alter the orbit of Resident Space Objects (RSOs), techniques for atmospheric density forecasting are vital for space situational awareness. While linear data-driven methods, such as dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), have been used previously for forecasting atmospheric density, deep learning-based forecasting has the ability to capture nonlinearities in data. By learning multiple layer weights from historical atmospheric density data, long-term dependencies in the dataset are captured in the mapping between the current atmospheric density state and control input to the atmospheric density state at the next timestep. This work improves upon previous linear propagation methods for atmospheric density forecasting, by developing a nonlinear transformer-based architecture for atmospheric density forecasting. Empirical NRLMSISE-00 and JB2008, as well as physics-based TIEGCM atmospheric density models are compared for forecasting with DMDc and with the transformer-based propagator. "

        "abstract": "Speech enhancement concerns the processes required to remove unwanted background sounds from the target speech to improve its quality and intelligibility. In this paper, a novel approach for single-channel speech enhancement is presented, using colored spectrograms. We propose the use of a deep neural network (DNN) architecture adapted from the pix2pix generative adversarial network (GAN) and train it over colored spectrograms of speech to denoise them. After denoising, the colors of spectrograms are translated to magnitudes of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) using a shallow regression neural network. These estimated STFT magnitudes are later combined with the noisy phases to obtain an enhanced speech. The results show an improvement of almost 0.84 points in the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and 1% in the short-term objective intelligibility (STOI) over the unprocessed noisy data. The gain in quality and intelligibility over the unprocessed signal is almost equal to the gain achieved by the baseline methods used for comparison with the proposed model, but at a much reduced computational cost. The proposed solution offers a comparative PESQ score at almost 10 times reduced computational cost than a similar baseline model that has generated the highest PESQ score trained on grayscaled spectrograms, while it provides only a 1% deficit in STOI at 28 times reduced computational cost when compared to another baseline system based on convolutional neural network-GAN (CNN-GAN) that produces the most intelligible speech.

Using this reformulation, we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking phenomena. We argue that this lead to a form of instability that lies at the heart of their generative capabilities and that can be described by a set of mean field critical exponents. We conclude by analyzing recent work connecting diffusion models and associative memory networks in view of the thermodynamic formulations. "

        "abstract": "Flow-based generative models enjoy certain advantages in computing the data generation and the likelihood, and have recently shown competitive empirical performance. Compared to the accumulating theoretical studies on related score-based diffusion models, analysis of flow-based models, which are deterministic in both forward (data-to-noise) and reverse (noise-to-data) directions, remain sparse. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of generating data distribution by a progressive flow model, the so-called JKO flow model, which implements the Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme in a normalizing flow network. Leveraging the exponential convergence of the proximal gradient descent (GD) in Wasserstein space, we prove the Kullback-Leibler (KL) guarantee of data generation by a JKO flow model to be $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ when using $N \\lesssim \\log (1/\\varepsilon)$ many JKO steps ($N$ Residual Blocks in the flow) where $\\varepsilon $ is the error in the per-step first-order condition. The assumption on data density is merely a finite second moment, and the theory extends to data distributions without density and when there are inversion errors in the reverse process where we obtain KL-$W_2$ mixed error guarantees. The non-asymptotic convergence rate of the JKO-type $W_2$-proximal GD is proved for a general class of convex objective functionals that includes the KL divergence as a special case, which can be of independent interest.
