        "abstract": "Product embedding serves as a cornerstone for a wide range of applications in eCommerce. The product embedding learned from multiple modalities shows significant improvement over that from a single modality, since different modalities provide complementary information. However, some modalities are more informatively dominant than others. How to teach a model to learn embedding from different modalities without neglecting information from the less dominant modality is challenging. We present an image-text embedding model (ITEm), an unsupervised learning method that is designed to better attend to image and text modalities. We extend BERT by (1) learning an embedding from text and image without knowing the regions of interest; (2) training a global representation to predict masked words and to construct masked image patches without their individual representations. We evaluate the pre-trained ITEm on two tasks: the search for extremely similar products and the prediction of product categories, showing substantial gains compared to strong baseline models. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02089",
        "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant progress in language understanding and generation. By leveraging textual features, customized LLMs are also applied for recommendation and demonstrate improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios. Yet the majority of existing methods perform training-free recommendation that heavily relies on pretrained knowledge (e.g., movie recommendation). In addition, inference on LLMs is slow due to autoregressive generation, rendering existing methods less effective for real-time recommendation. As such, we propose a two-stage framework using large language models for ranking-based recommendation (LlamaRec). In particular, we use small-scale sequential recommenders to retrieve candidates based on the user interaction history. Then, both history and retrieved items are fed to the LLM in text via a carefully designed prompt template. Instead of generating next-item titles, we adopt a verbalizer-based approach that transforms output logits into probability distributions over the candidate items. Therefore, the proposed LlamaRec can efficiently rank items without generating long text. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare against state-of-the-art baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the performance of LlamaRec, which consistently achieves superior performance in both recommendation performance and efficiency. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02105",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI assistants in various domains. To meet the requirements of different applications, LLMs are often customized by further fine-tuning. However, the powerful learning ability of LLMs not only enables them to acquire new tasks but also makes them susceptible to learning undesired behaviors. For example, even safety-aligned LLMs can be easily fine-tuned into harmful assistants as the fine-tuning data often contains implicit or explicit harmful content. Can we train LLMs on harmful data without learning harmful behaviors? This paper proposes a controllable training framework that makes harmful behaviors unlearnable during the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce ``security vectors'', a few new parameters that can be separated from the LLM, to ensure LLM's responses are consistent with the harmful behavior. Security vectors are activated during fine-tuning, the consistent behavior makes LLM believe that such behavior has already been learned, there is no need to further optimize for harmful data. During inference, we can deactivate security vectors to restore the LLM's normal behavior. The experimental results show that the security vectors generated by 100 harmful samples are enough to prevent LLM from learning 1000 harmful samples, while preserving the ability to learn other useful information.

On the other hand, other types of generative AI have been used to synthesize images and other types of data for research and practical purposes, which have resolved some ethical issues and exposed other ethical issues, but such technology is less often the focus of ongoing ethical discussions. Here we highlight gaps in current ethical discussions of generative AI via a systematic scoping review of relevant existing research in healthcare, and reduce the gaps by proposing an ethics checklist for comprehensive assessment and transparent documentation of ethical discussions in generative AI development. While the checklist can be readily integrated into the current peer review and publication system to enhance generative AI research, it may also be used in broader settings to disclose ethics-related considerations in generative AI-powered products (or real-life applications of such products) to help users establish reasonable trust in their capabilities.

        "abstract": "Due to the remarkable capabilities of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) in effectively following instructions, there has been a growing number of assistants in the community to assist humans. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of Vision Language Models (VLMs), expanding the capabilities of LLMs and enabling them to execute more diverse instructions. However, it is foreseeable that models will likely need to handle tasks involving additional modalities such as speech, video, and others. This poses a particularly prominent challenge of dealing with the complexity of mixed modalities. To address this, we introduce a novel architecture called PILL: Plug Into LLM with adapter expert and attention gate to better decouple these complex modalities and leverage efficient fine-tuning. We introduce two modules: Firstly, utilizing Mixture-of-Modality-Adapter-Expert to independently handle different modalities, enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks while preserving the expressive capability of the original model. Secondly, by introducing Modality-Attention-Gating, which enables adaptive control of the contribution of modality tokens to the overall representation. In addition, we have made improvements to the Adapter to enhance its learning and expressive capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits competitive performance compared to other mainstream methods for modality fusion.

        "abstract": "Generative models for graphs often encounter scalability challenges due to the inherent need to predict interactions for every node pair. Despite the sparsity often exhibited by real-world graphs, the unpredictable sparsity patterns of their adjacency matrices, stemming from their unordered nature, leads to quadratic computational complexity. In this work, we introduce SparseDiff, a denoising diffusion model for graph generation that is able to exploit sparsity during its training phase. At the core of SparseDiff is a message-passing neural network tailored to predict only a subset of edges during each forward pass. When combined with a sparsity-preserving noise model, this model can efficiently work with edge lists representations of graphs, paving the way for scalability to much larger structures. During the sampling phase, SparseDiff iteratively populates the adjacency matrix from its prior state, ensuring prediction of the full graph while controlling memory utilization. Experimental results show that SparseDiff simultaneously matches state-of-the-art in generation performance on both small and large graphs, highlighting the versatility of our method. "

        "abstract": "Decision making via sequence modeling aims to mimic the success of language models, where actions taken by an embodied agent are modeled as tokens to predict. Despite their promising performance, it remains unclear if embodied sequence modeling leads to the emergence of internal representations that represent the environmental state information. A model that lacks abstract state representations would be liable to make decisions based on surface statistics which fail to generalize. We take the BabyAI environment, a grid world in which language-conditioned navigation tasks are performed, and build a sequence modeling Transformer, which takes a language instruction, a sequence of actions, and environmental observations as its inputs. In order to investigate the emergence of abstract state representations, we design a \"blindfolded\" navigation task, where only the initial environmental layout, the language instruction, and the action sequence to complete the task are available for training. Our probing results show that intermediate environmental layouts can be reasonably reconstructed from the internal activations of a trained model, and that language instructions play a role in the reconstruction accuracy. Our results suggest that many key features of state representations can emerge via embodied sequence modeling, supporting an optimistic outlook for applications of sequence modeling objectives to more complex embodied decision-making domains.

In this article, we review the major technical innovations that underpin modern NLP models and present state-of-the-art NLP applications that employ LLMs in radiation oncology research. However, these LLMs are prone to many errors such as hallucinations, biases, and ethical violations, which necessitate rigorous evaluation and validation before clinical deployment. As such, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the NLP models based on their purpose and clinical fit, technical performance, bias and trust, legal and ethical implications, and quality assurance, prior to implementation in clinical radiation oncology.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models to identify reasoning challenges specific to them. Henceforth, we develop a diverse set of numerical probes employing a semi-automated approach. We focus on the tabular Natural Language Inference (TNLI) task as a case study and measure models' performance shifts. Our results show that no model consistently excels across all numerical reasoning types. Among the probed models, FlanT5 (few-/zero-shot) and GPT-3.5 (few-shot) demonstrate strong overall numerical reasoning skills compared to other models. Label-flipping probes indicate that models often exploit dataset artifacts to predict the correct labels. "

        "abstract": "Transfer learning enables the sharing of common knowledge among models for a variety of downstream tasks, but traditional methods suffer in limited training data settings and produce narrow models incapable of effectively generalizing under distribution shifts. Foundation models have recently demonstrated impressive zero-shot inference capabilities and robustness under distribution shifts. However, zero-shot evaluation for these models has been predominantly confined to benchmarks with simple distribution shifts, limiting our understanding of their effectiveness under the more realistic shifts found in practice. Moreover, common fine-tuning methods for these models have yet to be evaluated against vision models in few-shot scenarios where training data is limited. To address these gaps, we present a new recipe for few-shot fine-tuning of the popular vision-language foundation model CLIP and evaluate its performance on challenging benchmark datasets with realistic distribution shifts from the WILDS collection. Our experimentation demonstrates that, while zero-shot CLIP fails to match performance of trained vision models on more complex benchmarks, few-shot CLIP fine-tuning outperforms its vision-only counterparts in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy at all levels of training data availability. This provides a strong incentive for adoption of foundation models within few-shot learning applications operating with real-world data.

        "abstract": "Acuity assessments are vital in critical care settings to provide timely interventions and fair resource allocation. Traditional acuity scores rely on manual assessments and documentation of physiological states, which can be time-consuming, intermittent, and difficult to use for healthcare providers. Furthermore, such scores do not incorporate granular information such as patients' mobility level, which can indicate recovery or deterioration in the ICU. We hypothesized that existing acuity scores could be potentially improved by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in conjunction with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and wearable sensor data. In this study, we evaluated the impact of integrating mobility data collected from wrist-worn accelerometers with clinical data obtained from EHR for developing an AI-driven acuity assessment score. Accelerometry data were collected from 86 patients wearing accelerometers on their wrists in an academic hospital setting. The data was analyzed using five deep neural network models: VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Transformer network. These models outperformed a rule-based clinical score (SOFA= Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) used as a baseline, particularly regarding the precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. The results showed that while a model relying solely on accelerometer data achieved limited performance (AUC 0.50, Precision 0.61, and F1-score 0.68), including demographic information with the accelerometer data led to a notable enhancement in performance (AUC 0.69, Precision 0.75, and F1-score 0.67). This work shows that the combination of mobility and patient information can successfully differentiate between stable and unstable states in critically ill patients. "

        "abstract": "In human-written articles, we often leverage the subtleties of text style, such as bold and italics, to guide the attention of readers. These textual emphases are vital for the readers to grasp the conveyed information. When interacting with large language models (LLMs), we have a similar need - steering the model to pay closer attention to user-specified information, e.g., an instruction. Existing methods, however, are constrained to process plain text and do not support such a mechanism. This motivates us to introduce PASTA - Post-hoc Attention STeering Approach, a method that allows LLMs to read text with user-specified emphasis marks. To this end, PASTA identifies a small subset of attention heads and applies precise attention reweighting on them, directing the model attention to user-specified parts. Like prompting, PASTA is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters. Experiments demonstrate that PASTA can substantially enhance an LLM's ability to follow user instructions or integrate new knowledge from user inputs, leading to a significant performance improvement on a variety of tasks, e.g., an average accuracy improvement of 22% for LLAMA-7B.

In response, we provide a general theory of meaning that extends beyond humans. We use this theory to explicate the precise nature of LLMs as meaning-agents. We suggest that the LLM, by virtue of its position as a meaning-agent, already grasps the constructions of human society (e.g. morality, gender, and race) in concept. Consequently, under certain ethical frameworks, currently popular methods for model alignment are limited at best and counterproductive at worst.

Furthermore, these approaches failed to leverage the inherent interconnectedness among different code-related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-task fine-tuning framework, MFTcoder, that enables simultaneous and parallel fine-tuning on multiple tasks. By incorporating various loss functions, we effectively address common challenges in multi-task learning, such as data imbalance, varying difficulty levels, and inconsistent convergence speeds.

        "abstract": "Manatees are aquatic mammals with voracious appetites. They rely on sea grass as the main food source, and often spend up to eight hours a day grazing. They move slow and frequently stay in group (i.e. aggregations) in shallow water to search for food, making them vulnerable to environment change and other risks. Accurate counting manatee aggregations within a region is not only biologically meaningful in observing their habit, but also crucial for designing safety rules for human boaters, divers, etc., as well as scheduling nursing, intervention, and other plans. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based crowd counting approach to automatically count number of manatees within a region, by using low quality images as input. Because manatees have unique shape and they often stay in shallow water in groups, water surface reflection, occlusion, camouflage etc. making it difficult to accurately count manatee numbers. To address the challenges, we propose to use Anisotropic Gaussian Kernel (AGK), with tunable rotation and variances, to ensure that density functions can maximally capture shapes of individual manatees in different aggregations. After that, we apply AGK kernel to different types of deep neural networks primarily designed for crowd counting, including VGG, SANet, Congested Scene Recognition network (CSRNet), MARUNet etc. to learn manatee densities and calculate number of manatees in the scene. By using generic low quality images extracted from surveillance videos, our experiment results and comparison show that AGK kernel based manatee counting achieves minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed method works particularly well for counting manatee aggregations in environments with complex background. "

Considering that continuous observation is often inaccessible in such settings, our task involves working with a discrete set of frames separated by indefinite periods during which substantial changes to the scene may occur.

Therefore, we present a new method in this paper, Stable Diffusion Reference Only, a images-to-image self-supervised model that uses only two types of conditional images for precise control generation to accelerate secondary painting. The first type of conditional image serves as an image prompt, supplying the necessary conceptual and color information for generation. The second type is blueprint image, which controls the visual structure of the generated image. It is natively embedded into the original UNet, eliminating the need for ControlNet. We released all the code for the module and pipeline, and trained a controllable character line art coloring model at https://github.com/aihao2000/stable-diffusion-reference-only, that achieved state-of-the-art results in this field. This verifies the effectiveness of the structure and greatly improves the production efficiency of animations, comics, and fanworks. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02344",
        "abstract": "Unsupervised rationale extraction aims to extract concise and contiguous text snippets to support model predictions without any annotated rationale. Previous studies have used a two-phase framework known as the Rationalizing Neural Prediction (RNP) framework, which follows a generate-then-predict paradigm. They assumed that the extracted explanation, called rationale, should be sufficient to predict the golden label. However, the assumption above deviates from the original definition and is too strict to perform well. Furthermore, these two-phase models suffer from the interlocking problem and spurious correlations. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel single-phase framework called You Only Forward Once (YOFO), derived from a relaxed version of rationale where rationales aim to support model predictions rather than make predictions. In our framework, A pre-trained language model like BERT is deployed to simultaneously perform prediction and rationalization with less impact from interlocking or spurious correlations. Directly choosing the important tokens in an unsupervised manner is intractable. Instead of directly choosing the important tokens, YOFO gradually removes unimportant tokens during forward propagation. Through experiments on the BeerAdvocate and Hotel Review datasets, we demonstrate that our model is able to extract rationales and make predictions more accurately compared to RNP-based models. We observe an improvement of up to 18.4\\% in token-level F1 compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also conducted analyses and experiments to explore the extracted rationales and token decay strategies. The results show that YOFO can extract precise and important rationales while removing unimportant tokens in the middle part of the model. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02373",
        "abstract": "While state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, concerns regarding their security persist. Earlier research highlighted DMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks, but these studies placed stricter requirements than conventional methods like 'BadNets' in image classification. This is because the former necessitates modifications to the diffusion sampling and training procedures. Unlike the prior work, we investigate whether generating backdoor attacks in DMs can be as simple as BadNets, i.e., by only contaminating the training dataset without tampering the original diffusion process. In this more realistic backdoor setting, we uncover bilateral backdoor effects that not only serve an adversarial purpose (compromising the functionality of DMs) but also offer a defensive advantage (which can be leveraged for backdoor defense). Specifically, we find that a BadNets-like backdoor attack remains effective in DMs for producing incorrect images (misaligned with the intended text conditions), and thereby yielding incorrect predictions when DMs are used as classifiers. Meanwhile, backdoored DMs exhibit an increased ratio of backdoor triggers, a phenomenon we refer to as `trigger amplification', among the generated images. We show that this latter insight can be used to enhance the detection of backdoor-poisoned training data. Even under a low backdoor poisoning ratio, studying the backdoor effects of DMs is also valuable for designing anti-backdoor image classifiers. Last but not least, we establish a meaningful linkage between backdoor attacks and the phenomenon of data replications by exploring DMs' inherent data memorization tendencies.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays an important role in the robotic manipulation domain since it allows self-learning from trial-and-error interactions with the environment. Still, sample efficiency and reward specification seriously limit its potential. One possible solution involves learning from expert guidance. However, obtaining a human expert is impractical due to the high cost of supervising an RL agent, and developing an automatic supervisor is a challenging endeavor. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable abilities to provide human-like feedback on user inputs in natural language. Nevertheless, they are not designed to directly control low-level robotic motions, as their pretraining is based on vast internet data rather than specific robotics data. In this paper, we introduce the Lafite-RL (Language agent feedback interactive Reinforcement Learning) framework, which enables RL agents to learn robotic tasks efficiently by taking advantage of LLMs' timely feedback. Our experiments conducted on RLBench tasks illustrate that, with simple prompt design in natural language, the Lafite-RL agent exhibits improved learning capabilities when guided by an LLM. It outperforms the baseline in terms of both learning efficiency and success rate, underscoring the efficacy of the rewards provided by an LLM. "

Unfortunately, conventional transformers struggle with long sequence training due to the overwhelming computation and memory requirements. Existing methods for long sequence training offer limited speedup and memory reduction, and may compromise accuracy. This paper presents a novel and efficient distributed training method, the Long Short-Sequence Transformer (LSS Transformer), for training transformer with long sequences. It distributes a long sequence into segments among GPUs, with each GPU computing a partial self-attention for its segment. Then, it uses a fused communication and a novel double gradient averaging technique to avoid the need to aggregate partial self-attention and minimize communication overhead. We evaluated the performance between LSS Transformer and the state-of-the-art Nvidia sequence parallelism on a Wikipedia enwik8 dataset. Results show that our proposed method lead to 5.6x faster and 10.2x more memory-efficient implementation compared to state-of-the-art sequence parallelism on 144 Nvidia V100 GPUs. Moreover, our algorithm scales to an extreme sequence length of 50,112 at 3,456 GPUs, achieving 161% super-linear parallel efficiency and a throughput of 32 petaflops. "

To mitigate both of these problems at once, we propose a novel method to continually train transformer-based vision models using low-rank adaptation and task arithmetic. Our method completely bypasses the problem of catastrophic forgetting, as well as reducing the computational requirement for training models on each task. When aided with a small memory of 10 samples per class, our method achieves performance close to full-set finetuning. We present rigorous ablations to support the prowess of our method. "

        "abstract": "Grounding-based vision and language models have been successfully applied to low-level vision tasks, aiming to precisely locate objects referred in captions. The effectiveness of grounding representation learning heavily relies on the scale of the training dataset. Despite being a useful data enrichment strategy, data augmentation has received minimal attention in existing vision and language tasks as augmentation for image-caption pairs is non-trivial. In this study, we propose a robust phrase grounding model trained with text-conditioned and text-unconditioned data augmentations. Specifically, we apply text-conditioned color jittering and horizontal flipping to ensure semantic consistency between images and captions. To guarantee image-caption correspondence in the training samples, we modify the captions according to pre-defined keywords when applying horizontal flipping. Additionally, inspired by recent masked signal reconstruction, we propose to use pixel-level masking as a novel form of data augmentation. While we demonstrate our data augmentation method with MDETR framework, the proposed approach is applicable to common grounding-based vision and language tasks with other frameworks. Finally, we show that image encoder pretrained on large-scale image and language datasets (such as CLIP) can further improve the results. Through extensive experiments on three commonly applied datasets: Flickr30k, referring expressions and GQA, our method demonstrates advanced performance over the state-of-the-arts with various metrics.

        "abstract": "Recognizing a target of interest from the UAVs is much more challenging than the existing object re-identification tasks across multiple city cameras. The images taken by the UAVs usually suffer from significant size difference when generating the object bounding boxes and uncertain rotation variations. Existing methods are usually designed for city cameras, incapable of handing the rotation issue in UAV scenarios. A straightforward solution is to perform the image-level rotation augmentation, but it would cause loss of useful information when inputting the powerful vision transformer as patches. This motivates us to simulate the rotation operation at the patch feature level, proposing a novel rotation invariant vision transformer (RotTrans). This strategy builds on high-level features with the help of the specificity of the vision transformer structure, which enhances the robustness against large rotation differences. In addition, we design invariance constraint to establish the relationship between the original feature and the rotated features, achieving stronger rotation invariance. Our proposed transformer tested on the latest UAV datasets greatly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts, which is 5.9\\% and 4.8\\% higher than the highest mAP and Rank1. Notably, our model also performs competitively for the person re-identification task on traditional city cameras. In particular, our solution wins the first place in the UAV-based person re-recognition track in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition held in ICCV 2021.

        "abstract": "Time series classification is a widely studied problem in the field of time series data mining. Previous research has predominantly focused on scenarios where relevant or foreground subsequences have already been extracted, with each subsequence corresponding to a single label. However, real-world time series data often contain foreground subsequences that are intertwined with background subsequences. Successfully classifying these relevant subsequences requires not only distinguishing between different classes but also accurately identifying the foreground subsequences amidst the background. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subsequence classification method that represents each subsequence as an ego-network, providing crucial nearest neighbor information to the model. The ego-networks of all subsequences collectively form a time series subsequence graph, and we introduce an algorithm to efficiently construct this graph. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the significance of enforcing temporal consistency in the prediction of adjacent subsequences for the subsequence classification problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using 128 univariate and 30 multivariate time series datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to alternative approaches. Specifically, our method outperforms the baseline on 104 out of 158 datasets. "

        "abstract": "Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%. "

Recently, sequential language models have been innovatively adopted for trajectory recovery in a pre-trained manner: it learns road segment representation vectors, which will be used in the downstream tasks. However, existing methods are incapable of handling complex trajectories: when the trajectory crosses remote road segments or makes several turns, which we call critical nodes, the quality of learned representations deteriorates, and the recovered trajectories skip the critical nodes. This work is dedicated to offering a more robust trajectory recovery for complex trajectories. Firstly, we define the trajectory complexity based on the detour score and entropy score and construct the complexity-aware semantic graphs correspondingly. Then, we propose a Multi-view Graph and Complexity Aware Transformer (MGCAT) model to encode these semantics in trajectory pre-training from two aspects: 1) adaptively aggregate the multi-view graph features considering trajectory pattern, and 2) higher attention to critical nodes in a complex trajectory. Such that, our MGCAT is perceptual when handling the critical scenario of complex trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale datasets. The results prove that our method learns better representations for trajectory recovery, with 5.22% higher F1-score overall and 8.16% higher F1-score for complex trajectories particularly.

        "abstract": "A restaurant dinner may become a memorable experience due to an unexpected aspect enjoyed by the customer, such as an origami-making station in the waiting area. If aspects that are atypical for a restaurant experience were known in advance, they could be leveraged to make recommendations that have the potential to engender serendipitous experiences, further increasing user satisfaction. Although relatively rare, whenever encountered, atypical aspects often end up being mentioned in reviews due to their memorable quality. Correspondingly, in this paper we introduce the task of detecting atypical aspects in customer reviews. To facilitate the development of extraction models, we manually annotate benchmark datasets of reviews in three domains - restaurants, hotels, and hair salons, which we use to evaluate a number of language models, ranging from fine-tuning the instruction-based text-to-text transformer Flan-T5 to zero-shot and few-shot prompting of GPT-3.5.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02733",
        "abstract": "Multimodal manipulations (also known as audio-visual deepfakes) make it difficult for unimodal deepfake detectors to detect forgeries in multimedia content. To avoid the spread of false propaganda and fake news, timely detection is crucial. The damage to either modality (i.e., visual or audio) can only be discovered through multi-modal models that can exploit both pieces of information simultaneously. Previous methods mainly adopt uni-modal video forensics and use supervised pre-training for forgery detection. This study proposes a new method based on a multi-modal self-supervised-learning (SSL) feature extractor to exploit inconsistency between audio and visual modalities for multi-modal video forgery detection. We use the transformer-based SSL pre-trained Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT) model as a visual and acoustic feature extractor and a multi-scale temporal convolutional neural network to capture the temporal correlation between the audio and visual modalities. Since AV-HuBERT only extracts visual features from the lip region, we also adopt another transformer-based video model to exploit facial features and capture spatial and temporal artifacts caused during the deepfake generation process. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the FakeAVCeleb and DeepfakeTIMIT datasets. "

We first show that employing these speech transformers as an encoder significantly improves the efficiency of pre-trained audio models as well. However, our study shows that we can achieve comparable efficiency with advanced self-attention solely. We demonstrate that this simpler approach is particularly beneficial with a low-bit weight quantization technique of a neural network to improve efficiency. We hypothesize that it prevents propagating the errors between different quantized modules compared to recent speech transformers mixing quantized convolution and the quantized self-attention modules.

        "abstract": "Deformable object manipulation stands as one of the most captivating yet formidable challenges in robotics. While previous techniques have predominantly relied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically represented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation: acquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be elusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the model's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we introduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of tackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We employ large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage plan corresponding to a specified task. For every individual stage, the LLM provides both the tool's name and the Python code to craft intermediate subgoal point clouds. With the tool and subgoal for a particular stage at our disposal, we present a granular closed-loop model predictive control strategy. This leverages Differentiable Physics with Point-to-Point correspondence (DiffPhysics-P2P) loss in the earth mover distance (EMD) space, applied iteratively. Experimental findings affirm that our technique surpasses multiple benchmarks in dough manipulation, spanning both short and long horizons. Remarkably, our model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities to novel and previously unencountered complex tasks without any preliminary demonstrations. We further substantiate our approach with experimental trials on real-world robotic platforms. "

Specifically, we encode each paper using the text embeddings by large language models (LLMs), extract similar samples by cosine similarity, and synthesize a counterfactual sample by the weighted average of similar papers according to their similarity values. We apply the resulting metric, called CausalCite, as a causal formulation of paper citations. We show its effectiveness on various criteria, such as high correlation with paper impact as reported by scientific experts on a previous dataset of 1K papers, (test-of-time) awards for past papers, and its stability across various sub-fields of AI.

        "abstract": "Traditional permutation schemes mostly focus on random scrambling of pixels, often neglecting the intrinsic image information that could enhance diffusion in image encryption algorithms. This paper introduces PermutEx, a feature-extraction-based permutation method that utilizes inherent image features to scramble pixels effectively. Unlike random permutation schemes, PermutEx extracts the spatial frequency and local contrast features of the image and ranks each pixel based on this information, identifying which pixels are more important or information-rich based on texture and edge information. In addition, a unique permutation key is generated using the Logistic-Sine Map based on chaotic behavior. The ranked pixels are permuted in conjunction with this unique key, effectively permuting the original image into a scrambled version. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively disrupts the correlation in information-rich areas within the image resulting in a correlation value of 0.000062. The effective scrambling of pixels, resulting in nearly zero correlation, makes this method suitable to be used as diffusion in image encryption algorithms. "

Our findings reveal that self-correction can lead to improvements in toxicity and truthfulness, but the extent of these improvements varies depending on the specific aspect of trustworthiness and the nature of the task. Interestingly, our study also uncovers instances of \"self-doubt\" in LLMs during the self-correction process, introducing a new set of challenges that need to be addressed. "

However, prior work 1) suggests that useful self-rationalization is emergent only at significant scales (e.g., 175B parameter GPT-3); and 2) focuses largely on downstream performance, ignoring the semantics of the rationales themselves, e.g., are they faithful, true, and helpful for humans? In this work, we enable small-scale LMs (approx. 200x smaller than GPT-3) to generate rationales that not only improve downstream task performance, but are also more plausible, consistent, and diverse, assessed both by automatic and human evaluation. Our method, MaRio (Multi-rewArd RatIOnalization), is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that optimizes multiple distinct properties like plausibility, diversity and consistency. Results on five difficult question-answering datasets StrategyQA, QuaRel, OpenBookQA, NumerSense and QASC show that not only does MaRio improve task accuracy, but it also improves the self-rationalization quality of small LMs across the aforementioned axes better than a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline. Extensive human evaluations confirm that MaRio rationales are preferred vs. SFT rationales, as well as qualitative improvements in plausibility and consistency. "

        "abstract": "Quantitative evaluation metrics have traditionally been pivotal in gauging the advancements of artificial intelligence systems, including large language models (LLMs). However, these metrics have inherent limitations. Given the intricate nature of real-world tasks, a single scalar to quantify and compare is insufficient to capture the fine-grained nuances of model behavior. Metrics serve only as a way to compare and benchmark models, and do not yield actionable diagnostics, thus making the model improvement process challenging. Model developers find themselves amid extensive manual efforts involving sifting through vast datasets and attempting hit-or-miss adjustments to training data or setups. In this work, we address the shortcomings of quantitative metrics by proposing QualEval, which augments quantitative scalar metrics with automated qualitative evaluation as a vehicle for model improvement. QualEval uses a powerful LLM reasoner and our novel flexible linear programming solver to generate human-readable insights that when applied, accelerate model improvement. The insights are backed by a comprehensive dashboard with fine-grained visualizations and human-interpretable analyses. We corroborate the faithfulness of QualEval by demonstrating that leveraging its insights, for example, improves the absolute performance of the Llama 2 model by up to 15% points relative on a challenging dialogue task (DialogSum) when compared to baselines. QualEval successfully increases the pace of model development, thus in essence serving as a data-scientist-in-a-box. Given the focus on critiquing and improving current evaluation metrics, our method serves as a refreshingly new technique for both model evaluation and improvement. "

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively. "

        "abstract": "Generalizable articulated object manipulation is essential for home-assistant robots. Recent efforts focus on imitation learning from demonstrations or reinforcement learning in simulation, however, due to the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection and precise object simulation, it still remains challenging for these works to achieve broad adaptability across diverse articulated objects. Recently, many works have tried to utilize the strong in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve generalizable robotic manipulation, but most of these researches focus on high-level task planning, sidelining low-level robotic control. In this work, building on the idea that the kinematic structure of the object determines how we can manipulate it, we propose a kinematic-aware prompting framework that prompts LLMs with kinematic knowledge of objects to generate low-level motion trajectory waypoints, supporting various object manipulation. To effectively prompt LLMs with the kinematic structure of different objects, we design a unified kinematic knowledge parser, which represents various articulated objects as a unified textual description containing kinematic joints and contact location. Building upon this unified description, a kinematic-aware planner model is proposed to generate precise 3D manipulation waypoints via a designed kinematic-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting method. Our evaluation spanned 48 instances across 16 distinct categories, revealing that our framework not only outperforms traditional methods on 8 seen categories but also shows a powerful zero-shot capability for 8 unseen articulated object categories. Moreover, the real-world experiments on 7 different object categories prove our framework's adaptability in practical scenarios.

Specifically, we propose a Cascade DyNeRF to facilitate stable convergence and temporal continuity under the supervision signal which is discrete along the time axis. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, we further introduce an Interpolation-driven Consistency Loss. It is optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between rendered frames from DyNeRF and interpolated frames from a pre-trained video interpolation model. Extensive experiments show that our Consistent4D can perform competitively to prior art alternatives, opening up new possibilities for 4D dynamic object generation from monocular videos, whilst also demonstrating advantage for conventional text-to-3D generation tasks.

In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis to assess the strengths and limitations of various commercial NMT systems and MT-oriented LLMs. Our findings indicate that neither NMT nor MT-oriented LLMs alone can effectively address all the translation issues, but MT-oriented LLMs can serve as a promising complement to the NMT systems. Building upon these insights, we explore hybrid methods and propose Cooperative Decoding (CoDec), which treats NMT systems as a pretranslation model and MT-oriented LLMs as a supplemental solution to handle complex scenarios beyond the capability of NMT alone. The results on the WMT22 test sets and a newly collected test set WebCrawl demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDec, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for combining NMT systems with MT-oriented LLMs in machine translation.

However, existing approaches often struggle to model complex multi-range dependencies using local spatiotemporal features and road network hierarchical knowledge. To address this, we propose MultiSPANS.

Then, based on ST-token and spatial-temporal position encoding, we employ the Transformers to capture long-range temporal and spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce structural entropy theory to optimize the spatial attention mechanism. Specifically, The structural entropy minimization algorithm is used to generate optimal road network hierarchies, i.e., encoding trees. Based on this, we propose a relative structural entropy-based position encoding and a multi-head attention masking scheme based on multi-layer encoding trees.

This distinction clarifies the basic assumptions behind chain-of-thought prompting and its implications for methods that use it, such as self-verification and prompt programming. "

        "abstract": "Diffusion model based Text-to-Image has achieved impressive achievements recently. Although current technology for synthesizing images is highly advanced and capable of generating images with high fidelity, it is still possible to give the show away when focusing on the text area in the generated image. To address this issue, we introduce AnyText, a diffusion-based multilingual visual text generation and editing model, that focuses on rendering accurate and coherent text in the image. AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image caption embeddings from the tokenizer to generate texts that seamlessly integrate with the background. We employed text-control diffusion loss and text perceptual loss for training to further enhance writing accuracy. AnyText can write characters in multiple languages, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address multilingual visual text generation. It is worth mentioning that AnyText can be plugged into existing diffusion models from the community for rendering or editing text accurately. After conducting extensive evaluation experiments, our method has outperformed all other approaches by a significant margin. Additionally, we contribute the first large-scale multilingual text images dataset, AnyWord-3M, containing 3 million image-text pairs with OCR annotations in multiple languages. Based on AnyWord-3M dataset, we propose AnyText-benchmark for the evaluation of visual text generation accuracy and quality. Our project will be open-sourced on https://github.com/tyxsspa/AnyText to improve and promote the development of text generation technology. "

        "abstract": "App reviews from app stores are crucial for improving software requirements. A large number of valuable reviews are continually being posted, describing software problems and expected features. Effectively utilizing user reviews necessitates the extraction of relevant information, as well as their subsequent summarization. Due to the substantial volume of user reviews, manual analysis is arduous. Various approaches based on natural language processing (NLP) have been proposed for automatic user review mining. However, the majority of them requires a manually crafted dataset to train their models, which limits their usage in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Mini-BAR, a tool that integrates large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot mining of user reviews in both English and French. Specifically, Mini-BAR is designed to (i) classify the user reviews, (ii) cluster similar reviews together, (iii) generate an abstractive summary for each cluster and (iv) rank the user review clusters. To evaluate the performance of Mini-BAR, we created a dataset containing 6,000 English and 6,000 French annotated user reviews and conducted extensive experiments. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Mini-BAR in requirement engineering by analyzing bilingual app reviews.

This work will introduce a machine learning framework for automatized large-scale plant-specific trait annotation for the use case disease severity scoring for Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) in sugar beet. With concepts of Deep Label Distribution Learning (DLDL), special loss functions, and a tailored model architecture, we develop an efficient Vision Transformer based model for disease severity scoring called SugarViT. One novelty in this work is the combination of remote sensing data with environmental parameters of the experimental sites for disease severity prediction. Although the model is evaluated on this special use case, it is held as generic as possible to also be applicable to various image-based classification and regression tasks. With our framework, it is even possible to learn models on multi-objective problems as we show by a pretraining on environmental metadata. "

        "abstract": "Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating text that closely resembles human writing across wide range of styles and genres. However, such capabilities are prone to potential abuse, such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic assignments. Hence, it is essential to build automated approaches capable of distinguishing between artificially generated text and human-authored text. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient solution to this problem by ensembling predictions from multiple constituent LLMs. Compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, which are perplexity-based or uses ensembles with a number of LLMs, our condensed ensembling approach uses only two constituent LLMs to achieve comparable performance. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets for generative text classification show performance improvements in the range of 0.5 to 100\\% compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. We also study the influence the training data from individual LLMs have on model performance. We found that substituting commercially-restrictive Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) data with data generated from other open language models such as Falcon, Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA2), and Mosaic Pretrained Transformers (MPT) is a feasible alternative when developing generative text detectors. Furthermore, to demonstrate zero-shot generalization, we experimented with an English essays dataset, and results suggest that our ensembling approach can handle new data effectively. "

        "abstract": "Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for detecting non-trivial topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case vanilla persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for most existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow persistent homology to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Furthermore, we derive a novel closed-form expression for effective resistance in terms of the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to several high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and show that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03099",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we uncover that Language Models (LMs), either encoder- or decoder-based, can obtain new capabilities by assimilating the parameters of homologous models without retraining or GPUs. Typically, new abilities of LMs can be imparted by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), reflected in the disparity between fine-tuned and pre-trained parameters (i.e., delta parameters). We initially observe that by introducing a novel operation called DARE (Drop And REscale), most delta parameters can be directly set to zeros without affecting the capabilities of SFT LMs and larger models can tolerate a higher proportion of discarded parameters. Based on this observation, we further sparsify delta parameters of multiple SFT homologous models with DARE and subsequently merge them into a single model by parameter averaging. We conduct experiments on eight datasets from the GLUE benchmark with BERT and RoBERTa. We also merge WizardLM, WizardMath, and Code Alpaca based on Llama 2. Experimental results show that: (1) The delta parameter value ranges for SFT models are typically small, often within 0.005, and DARE can eliminate 99% of them effortlessly. However, once the models are continuously pre-trained, the value ranges can grow to around 0.03, making DARE impractical. We have also tried to remove fine-tuned instead of delta parameters and find that a 10% reduction can lead to drastically decreased performance (even to 0). This highlights that SFT merely stimulates the abilities via delta parameters rather than injecting new abilities into LMs; (2) DARE can merge multiple task-specific LMs into one LM with diverse abilities. For instance, the merger of WizardLM and WizardMath improves the GSM8K zero-shot accuracy of WizardLM from 2.2 to 66.3, retaining its instruction-following ability while surpassing WizardMath's original 64.2 performance.

We use two approaches, in the first approach, we first train a sequence-level classifier to classify the sentences into categories to obtain the sentence-level tags (categorical labels). The sequence classifier is modeled as an entailment problem by modifying the labels as a natural language template. This helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. Further, this label information is injected into the NER model. In this paper, we demonstrate effective ways to represent and inject these labels and POS attributes into the NER model. In the second approach, we jointly learn the categorical labels and NER labels. Here we also inject the POS tags into the model to increase the syntactic context of the model. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that incorporating categorical label information with syntactic context is quite useful and outperforms baseline BERT-based models. "

        "abstract": "Creating high-quality controllable 3D human models from multi-view RGB videos poses a significant challenge. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable quality in reconstructing and free-viewpoint rendering of static as well as dynamic scenes. The extension to a controllable synthesis of dynamic human performances poses an exciting research question. In this paper, we introduce a novel NeRF-based framework for pose-dependent rendering of human performances. In our approach, the radiance field is warped around an SMPL body mesh, thereby creating a new surface-aligned representation. Our representation can be animated through skeletal joint parameters that are provided to the NeRF in addition to the viewpoint for pose dependent appearances. To achieve this, our representation includes the corresponding 2D UV coordinates on the mesh texture map and the distance between the query point and the mesh. To enable efficient learning despite mapping ambiguities and random visual variations, we introduce a novel remapping process that refines the mapped coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that our approach results in high-quality renderings for novel-view and novel-pose synthesis. "

Scale is a primary factor influencing the performance of these foundation models. However, these large foundation models often result in high computational cost that might limit their deployment. This paper focuses on pre-training relatively small vision transformer models that could be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Specifically, taking inspiration from knowledge distillation in model compression, we propose a new asymmetric masked distillation(AMD) framework for pre-training relatively small models with autoencoding. The core of AMD is to devise an asymmetric masking strategy, where the teacher model is enabled to see more context information with a lower masking ratio, while the student model still with high masking ratio to the original masked pre-training. We design customized multi-layer feature alignment between the teacher encoder and student encoder to regularize the pre-training of student MAE. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AMD, we apply it to both ImageMAE and VideoMAE for pre-training relatively small ViT models. AMD achieved 84.6% classification accuracy on IN1K using the ViT-B model. And AMD achieves 73.3% classification accuracy using the ViT-B model on the Something-in-Something V2 dataset, a 3.7% improvement over the original ViT-B model from VideoMAE. We also transfer AMD pre-trained models to downstream tasks and obtain consistent performance improvement over the standard pre-training. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03157",
        "abstract": "Modern database management systems (DBMS) expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviours. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance is a long-standing problem in the database community. As there is an increasing number of knobs to tune and each knob could be in continuous or categorical values, manual tuning becomes impractical. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods have shown great potentials. However, existing approaches still incur significant tuning costs or only yield sub-optimal performance. This is because they either ignore the extensive domain knowledge available (e.g., DBMS manuals and forum discussions) and only rely on the runtime feedback of benchmark evaluations to guide the optimization, or they utilize the domain knowledge in a limited way. Hence, we propose GPTuner, a manual-reading database tuning system. Firstly, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline to collect and refine heterogeneous knowledge, and propose a prompt ensemble algorithm to unify a structured view of the refined knowledge. Secondly, using the structured knowledge, we (1) design a workload-aware and training-free knob selection strategy, (2) develop a search space optimization technique considering the value range of each knob, and (3) propose a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space. Finally, we evaluate GPTuner under different benchmarks (TPC-C and TPC-H), metrics (throughput and latency) as well as DBMS (PostgreSQL and MySQL). Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, GPTuner identifies better configurations in 16x less time on average. Moreover, GPTuner achieves up to 30% performance improvement (higher throughput or lower latency) over the best-performing alternative. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03172",
        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used for generating synthetic data for cases where there is a limited size real-world dataset or when data holders are unwilling to share their data samples. Recent works showed that GANs, due to overfitting and memorization, might leak information regarding their training data samples. This makes GANs vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Several defense strategies have been proposed in the literature to mitigate this privacy issue. Unfortunately, defense strategies based on differential privacy are proven to reduce extensively the quality of the synthetic data points. On the other hand, more recent frameworks such as PrivGAN and PAR-GAN are not suitable for small-size training datasets. In the present work, the overfitting in GANs is studied in terms of the discriminator, and a more general measure of overfitting based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient is defined. Then, inspired by Fano's inequality, our first defense mechanism against MIAs is proposed. This framework, which requires only a simple modification in the loss function of GANs, is referred to as the maximum entropy GAN or MEGAN and significantly improves the robustness of GANs to MIAs. As a second defense strategy, a more heuristic model based on minimizing the information leaked from generated samples about the training data points is presented. This approach is referred to as mutual information minimization GAN (MIMGAN) and uses a variational representation of the mutual information to minimize the information that a synthetic sample might leak about the whole training data set. Applying the proposed frameworks to some commonly used data sets against state-of-the-art MIAs reveals that the proposed methods can reduce the accuracy of the adversaries to the level of random guessing accuracy with a small reduction in the quality of the synthetic data samples.

However, previous studies for jailbreaks usually resort to brute-force optimization or extrapolations of a high computation cost, which might not be practical or effective. In this paper, inspired by the Milgram experiment that individuals can harm another person if they are told to do so by an authoritative figure, we disclose a lightweight method, termed as DeepInception, which can easily hypnotize LLM to be a jailbreaker and unlock its misusing risks. Specifically, DeepInception leverages the personification ability of LLM to construct a novel nested scene to behave, which realizes an adaptive way to escape the usage control in a normal scenario and provides the possibility for further direct jailbreaks. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments to show its efficacy. Our DeepInception can achieve competitive jailbreak success rates with previous counterparts and realize a continuous jailbreak in subsequent interactions, which reveals the critical weakness of self-losing on both open/closed-source LLMs like Falcon, Vicuna, Llama-2, and GPT-3.5/4/4V.

We conduct simulation-based experiments and find that minimizing the Euclidean-Norm of the total residual load at transformer sub-stations is an effective objective for harnessing DR for dispatching highly renewable grids. We show that this control objective can be effectively achieved without optimal power flow calculations or knowledge about the topology of a grid. Additionally, we find that pursuing this objective reduces the sum of peak power flows along all lines in an active distribution network and therefore provides not only smaller voltage deviations, but also lower transmission losses.

        "abstract": "In recent years, the state-of-the-art in deep learning has been dominated by very large models that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The paradigm is very simple: Investing more computational resources (optimally) leads to better performance, and even predictably so; neural scaling laws have been derived that accurately forecast the performance of a network for a desired level of compute. This leads to the notion of a \"compute-optimal\" model, i.e. a model that allocates a given level of compute during training optimally to maximise performance. In this work, we extend the concept of optimality by allowing for an \"adaptive\" model, i.e. a model that can change its shape during the course of training. By allowing the shape to adapt, we can optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute to reach a given target performance. We focus on vision tasks and the family of Vision Transformers, where the patch size as well as the width naturally serve as adaptive shape parameters. We demonstrate that, guided by scaling laws, we can design compute-optimal adaptive models that beat their \"static\" counterparts. "

Smaller values of $p$ promote sparsity and interpretability, while larger values encourage smoother solutions. In this paper, we first show that the self-attention mechanism obtains the minimal Laplacian regularization ($p=2$) and encourages the smoothness in the architecture. However, the smoothness is not suitable for the heterophilic structure of self-attention in transformers where attention weights between tokens that are in close proximity and non-close ones are assigned indistinguishably. From that insight, we then propose a novel class of transformers, namely the $p$-Laplacian Transformer (p-LaT), which leverages $p$-Laplacian regularization framework to harness the heterophilic features within self-attention layers. In particular, low $p$ values will effectively assign higher attention weights to tokens that are in close proximity to the current token being processed. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of p-LaT over the baseline transformers on a wide range of benchmark datasets. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03250",
        "abstract": "Generative approaches powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities in tasks that require complex reasoning abilities. Yet the generative nature still makes the generated content suffer from hallucinations, thus unsuitable for entity-centric tasks like entity linking (EL) requiring precise entity predictions over a large knowledge base. We present Instructed Generative Entity Linker (INSGENEL), the first approach that enables casual language models to perform entity linking over knowledge bases. Several methods to equip language models with EL capability were proposed in this work, including (i) a sequence-to-sequence training EL objective with instruction-tuning, (ii) a novel generative EL framework based on a light-weight potential mention retriever that frees the model from heavy and non-parallelizable decoding, achieving 4$\\times$ speedup without compromise on linking metrics. INSGENEL outperforms previous generative alternatives with +6.8 F1 points gain on average, also with a huge advantage in training data efficiency and training compute consumption. In addition, our skillfully engineered in-context learning (ICL) framework for EL still lags behind INSGENEL significantly, reaffirming that the EL task remains a persistent hurdle for general LLMs. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03253",
        "abstract": "Previous entity disambiguation (ED) methods adopt a discriminative paradigm, where prediction is made based on matching scores between mention context and candidate entities using length-limited encoders. However, these methods often struggle to capture explicit discourse-level dependencies, resulting in incoherent predictions at the abstract level (e.g. topic or category). We propose CoherentED, an ED system equipped with novel designs aimed at enhancing the coherence of entity predictions. Our method first introduces an unsupervised variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract latent topic vectors of context sentences. This approach not only allows the encoder to handle longer documents more effectively, conserves valuable input space, but also keeps a topic-level coherence. Additionally, we incorporate an external category memory, enabling the system to retrieve relevant categories for undecided mentions. By employing step-by-step entity decisions, this design facilitates the modeling of entity-entity interactions, thereby maintaining maximum coherence at the category level. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on popular ED benchmarks, with an average improvement of 1.3 F1 points. Our model demonstrates particularly outstanding performance on challenging long-text scenarios. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03275",
        "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently shown impressive capability in modeling heterogeneous graphs that are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Due to the diversity of attributes of nodes in different types, most existing models first align nodes by mapping them into the same low-dimensional space. However, in this way, they lose the type information of nodes. In addition, most of them only consider the interactions between nodes while neglecting the high-order information behind the latent interactions among different node features. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph model MULAN, including two major components, i.e., a type-aware encoder and a dimension-aware encoder. Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and better leverages graph heterogeneity in learning node representations. Built upon transformer architecture, the dimension-aware encoder is capable of capturing the latent interactions among the diverse node features. With these components, the information of graph heterogeneity, node features and graph structure can be comprehensively encoded in node representations. We conduct extensive experiments on six heterogeneous benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the superiority of MULAN over other state-of-the-art competitors and also shows that MULAN is efficient. "

        "abstract": "While GPT-4V(ision) impressively models both visual and textual information simultaneously, it's hallucination behavior has not been systematically assessed. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, namely, the Bias and Interference Challenges in Visual Language Models (Bingo). This benchmark is designed to evaluate and shed light on the two common types of hallucinations in visual language models: bias and interference. Here, bias refers to the model's tendency to hallucinate certain types of responses, possibly due to imbalance in its training data. Interference pertains to scenarios where the judgment of GPT-4V(ision) can be disrupted due to how the text prompt is phrased or how the input image is presented. We identify a notable regional bias, whereby GPT-4V(ision) is better at interpreting Western images or images with English writing compared to images from other countries or containing text in other languages. Moreover, GPT-4V(ision) is vulnerable to leading questions and is often confused when interpreting multiple images together. Popular mitigation approaches, such as self-correction and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not effective in resolving these challenges. We also identified similar biases and interference vulnerabilities with LLaVA and Bard. Our results characterize the hallucination challenges in GPT-4V(ision) and state-of-the-art visual-language models, and highlight the need for new solutions. The Bingo benchmark is available at https://github.com/gzcch/Bingo. "

        "abstract": "Various large language models (LLMs) have been proposed in recent years, including closed- and open-source ones, continually setting new records on multiple benchmarks. However, the development of LLMs still faces several issues, such as high cost of training models from scratch, and continual pre-training leading to catastrophic forgetting, etc. Although many such issues are addressed along the line of research on LLMs, an important yet practical limitation is that many studies overly pursue enlarging model sizes without comprehensively analyzing and optimizing the use of pre-training data in their learning process, as well as appropriate organization and leveraging of such data in training LLMs under cost-effective settings. In this work, we propose Ziya2, a model with 13 billion parameters adopting LLaMA2 as the foundation model, and further pre-trained on 700 billion tokens, where we focus on pre-training techniques and use data-centric optimization to enhance the learning process of Ziya2 on different stages. Experiments show that Ziya2 significantly outperforms other models in multiple benchmarks especially with promising results compared to representative open-source ones. Ziya2 (Base) is released at https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Ziya2-13B-Base and https://modelscope.cn/models/Fengshenbang/Ziya2-13B-Base/summary. "

        "abstract": "While current generative models have achieved promising performances in time-series synthesis, they either make strong assumptions on the data format (e.g., regularities) or rely on pre-processing approaches (e.g., interpolations) to simplify the raw data. In this work, we consider a class of time series with three common bad properties, including sampling irregularities, missingness, and large feature-temporal dimensions, and introduce a general model, TS-Diffusion, to process such complex time series. Our model consists of three parts under the framework of point process. The first part is an encoder of the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) that converts time series into dense representations, with the jump technique to capture sampling irregularities and self-attention mechanism to handle missing values; The second component of TS-Diffusion is a diffusion model that learns from the representation of time series. These time-series representations can have a complex distribution because of their high dimensions; The third part is a decoder of another ODE that generates time series with irregularities and missing values given their representations. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple time-series datasets, demonstrating that TS-Diffusion achieves excellent results on both conventional and complex time series and significantly outperforms previous baselines.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03311",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in educational tasks such as providing writing suggestions to students. Despite their potential, LLMs are known to harbor inherent biases which may negatively impact learners. Previous studies have investigated bias in models and data representations separately, neglecting the potential impact of LLM bias on human writing. In this paper, we investigate how bias transfers through an AI writing support pipeline. We conduct a large-scale user study with 231 students writing business case peer reviews in German. Students are divided into five groups with different levels of writing support: one classroom group with feature-based suggestions and four groups recruited from Prolific -- a control group with no assistance, two groups with suggestions from fine-tuned GPT-2 and GPT-3 models, and one group with suggestions from pre-trained GPT-3.5. Using GenBit gender bias analysis, Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT), and Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) we evaluate the gender bias at various stages of the pipeline: in model embeddings, in suggestions generated by the models, and in reviews written by students. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in gender bias between the resulting peer reviews of groups with and without LLM suggestions. Our research is therefore optimistic about the use of AI writing support in the classroom, showcasing a context where bias in LLMs does not transfer to students' responses. "

        "abstract": "Despite efforts to align large language models to produce harmless responses, they are still vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that elicit unrestricted behaviour. In this work, we investigate persona modulation as a black-box jailbreaking method to steer a target model to take on personalities that are willing to comply with harmful instructions. Rather than manually crafting prompts for each persona, we automate the generation of jailbreaks using a language model assistant. We demonstrate a range of harmful completions made possible by persona modulation, including detailed instructions for synthesising methamphetamine, building a bomb, and laundering money. These automated attacks achieve a harmful completion rate of 42.5% in GPT-4, which is 185 times larger than before modulation (0.23%). These prompts also transfer to Claude 2 and Vicuna with harmful completion rates of 61.0% and 35.9%, respectively. Our work reveals yet another vulnerability in commercial large language models and highlights the need for more comprehensive safeguards. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03354",
        "abstract": "A remarkable ability of human beings resides in compositional reasoning, i.e., the capacity to make \"infinite use of finite means\". However, current large vision-language foundation models (VLMs) fall short of such compositional abilities due to their \"bag-of-words\" behaviors and inability to construct words that correctly represent visual entities and the relations among the entities. To this end, we propose CoVLM, which can guide the LLM to explicitly compose visual entities and relationships among the text and dynamically communicate with the vision encoder and detection network to achieve vision-language communicative decoding. Specifically, we first devise a set of novel communication tokens for the LLM, for dynamic communication between the visual detection system and the language system. A communication token is generated by the LLM following a visual entity or a relation, to inform the detection network to propose regions that are relevant to the sentence generated so far. The proposed regions-of-interests (ROIs) are then fed back into the LLM for better language generation contingent on the relevant regions. The LLM is thus able to compose the visual entities and relationships through the communication tokens. The vision-to-language and language-to-vision communication are iteratively performed until the entire sentence is generated. Our framework seamlessly bridges the gap between visual perception and LLMs and outperforms previous VLMs by a large margin on compositional reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ~20% in HICO-DET mAP, ~14% in Cola top-1 accuracy, and ~3% on ARO top-1 accuracy). We also achieve state-of-the-art performances on traditional vision-language tasks such as referring expression comprehension and visual question answering. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02358",
        "abstract": "Large scale image super-resolution is a challenging computer vision task, since vast information is missing in a highly degraded image, say for example forscale x16 super-resolution. Diffusion models are used successfully in recent years in extreme super-resolution applications, in which Gaussian noise is used as a means to form a latent photo-realistic space, and acts as a link between the space of latent vectors and the latent photo-realistic space. There are quite a few sophisticated mathematical derivations on mapping the statistics of Gaussian noises making Diffusion Models successful. In this paper we propose a simple approach which gets away from using Gaussian noise but adopts some basic structures of diffusion models for efficient image super-resolution. Essentially, we propose a DNN to perform domain transfer between neighbor domains, which can learn the differences in statistical properties to facilitate gradual interpolation with results of reasonable quality. Further quality improvement is achieved by conditioning the domain transfer with reference to the input LR image. Experimental results show that our method outperforms not only state-of-the-art large scale super resolution models, but also the current diffusion models for image super-resolution. The approach can readily be extended to other image-to-image tasks, such as image enlightening, inpainting, denoising, etc. "

Traditional methodologies heavily rely on user-supplied cell annotations, focusing on individually expressed data, often neglecting the critical interactions between biological conditions, such as healthy versus diseased states. In response, here we introduce scBeacon, an innovative framework built upon a deep contrastive siamese network. scBeacon pioneers an unsupervised approach, adeptly identifying matched cell populations across varied conditions, enabling a refined differential gene analysis. By utilizing a VQ-VAE framework, a contrastive siamese network, and a greedy iterative strategy, scBeacon effectively pinpoints differential genes that hold potential as key biomarkers. Comprehensive evaluations on a diverse array of datasets validate scBeacon's superiority over existing single-cell differential gene analysis tools. Its precision and adaptability underscore its significant role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy in biomarker discovery. With the emphasis on the importance of biomarkers in diagnosis, scBeacon is positioned to be a pivotal asset in the evolution of personalized medicine and targeted treatments. "

        "abstract": "Generative models of observations under interventions have been a vibrant topic of interest across machine learning and the sciences in recent years. For example, in drug discovery, there is a need to model the effects of diverse interventions on cells in order to characterize unknown biological mechanisms of action. We propose the Sparse Additive Mechanism Shift Variational Autoencoder, SAMS-VAE, to combine compositionality, disentanglement, and interpretability for perturbation models. SAMS-VAE models the latent state of a perturbed sample as the sum of a local latent variable capturing sample-specific variation and sparse global variables of latent intervention effects. Crucially, SAMS-VAE sparsifies these global latent variables for individual perturbations to identify disentangled, perturbation-specific latent subspaces that are flexibly composable. We evaluate SAMS-VAE both quantitatively and qualitatively on a range of tasks using two popular single cell sequencing datasets. In order to measure perturbation-specific model-properties, we also introduce a framework for evaluation of perturbation models based on average treatment effects with links to posterior predictive checks. SAMS-VAE outperforms comparable models in terms of generalization across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, including a combinatorial reasoning task under resource paucity, and yields interpretable latent structures which correlate strongly to known biological mechanisms. Our results suggest SAMS-VAE is an interesting addition to the modeling toolkit for machine learning-driven scientific discovery. "

However, existing deep learning models analyze each modality independently, missing opportunities to integrate information across imaging modalities and time. In this study, we present Multi-modal Transformer (MMT), a neural network that utilizes mammography and ultrasound synergistically, to identify patients who currently have cancer and estimate the risk of future cancer for patients who are currently cancer-free. MMT aggregates multi-modal data through self-attention and tracks temporal tissue changes by comparing current exams to prior imaging. Trained on 1.3 million exams, MMT achieves an AUROC of 0.943 in detecting existing cancers, surpassing strong uni-modal baselines. For 5-year risk prediction, MMT attains an AUROC of 0.826, outperforming prior mammography-based risk models.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03314",
        "abstract": "While model architectures and training strategies have become more generic and flexible with respect to different data modalities over the past years, a persistent limitation lies in the assumption of fixed quantities and arrangements of input features. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in scenarios where the attributes captured during data acquisition vary across different samples. In this work, we aim at effectively leveraging data with varying features, without the need to constrain the input space to the intersection of potential feature sets or to expand it to their union. We propose a novel architecture that can directly process data without the necessity of aligned feature modalities by learning a general embedding space that captures the relationship between features across data samples with varying sets of features. This is achieved via a set-transformer architecture augmented by feature-encoder layers, thereby enabling the learning of a shared latent feature space from data originating from heterogeneous feature spaces. The advantages of the model are demonstrated for automatic cancer cell detection in acute myeloid leukemia in flow cytometry data, where the features measured during acquisition often vary between samples. Our proposed architecture's capacity to operate seamlessly across incongruent feature spaces is particularly relevant in this context, where data scarcity arises from the low prevalence of the disease.
