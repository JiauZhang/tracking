        "abstract": "Inspection of high-voltage power equipment is an effective way to ensure power supply reliability. Object recognition, one of the key technologies in automatic power equipment inspection, attracts attention of many researchers and engineers. Although quite a few existing models have some their own advantages, object relationship between equipment which is very important in this task is scarcely considered. This paper combining object relationship modeling and Transformer Model proposes a Relation Transformer Model. It has four parts -- backbone, encoder, decoder and prediction heads. With this structure, the proposed method shows in experiments a much better performance than other three commonly used models in object recognition in substation, largely promoting the development of automatic power equipment inspection.

This study evaluated the capabilities of leading LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, Claude2, and SenseNova, in answering conceptual biology questions. The models were tested on a 108-question multiple-choice exam covering biology topics in molecular biology, biological techniques, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Among the models, GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 and demonstrated the greatest consistency across trials with different prompts. The results indicated GPT-4's proficiency in logical reasoning and its potential to aid biology research through capabilities like data analysis, hypothesis generation, and knowledge integration. However, further development and validation are still required before the promise of LLMs in accelerating biological discovery can be realized. "

Using cosine similarity analysis, the study measures the linguistic proximity between original British English translations and those produced by LLMs for each dialect. The findings reveal that Indian and Irish English translations maintain notably high similarity scores, suggesting strong linguistic alignment with British English. In contrast, American English exhibits slightly lower similarity, reflecting its distinct linguistic traits. Additionally, the choice of LLM significantly impacts translation quality, with Llama-2-70b consistently demonstrating superior performance. The study underscores the importance of selecting the right model for dialect translation, emphasizing the role of linguistic expertise and contextual understanding in achieving accurate translations.

        "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have drawn extensive attention from academia and the public, due to the advent of the ChatGPT. While LLMs show their astonishing ability in text generation for various tasks, privacy concerns limit their usage in real-life businesses. More specifically, either the user's inputs (the user sends the query to the model-hosting server) or the model (the user downloads the complete model) itself will be revealed during the usage. Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising solution to this kind of problem. It protects both the user's input and the knowledge of the model by splitting the model into a bottom part and a top part, which is maintained by the user and the model provider, respectively. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that in LLMs, VFL fails to protect the user input since it is simple and cheap to reconstruct the input from the intermediate embeddings. Experiments show that even with a commercial GPU, the input sentence can be reconstructed in only one second. We also discuss several possible solutions to enhance the privacy of vertical federated LLMs. "

This problem is comprised of arithmetic questions posed in natural language, with an arbitrary adversarial string inserted before the question is complete. Even in the simple setting of 1-digit addition problems, it is easy to find adversarial prompts that make all tested models (including PaLM2, GPT4, Claude2) misbehave, and even to steer models to a particular wrong answer. We additionally provide a simple algorithm for finding successful attacks by querying those same models, which we name \"prompt inversion rejection sampling\" (PIRS). We finally show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and via agentic constitutional loops. However, we were not able to make a language model fully robust against adversarial arithmetic attacks. "

Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent. Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting, such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and making other simple changes to the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Large Language Models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, strategically deceiving their users in a realistic situation without direct instructions or training for deception.

However, scaling such prototypes to robust products with minimized hallucinations or fake responses still remains an open challenge, especially in niche data-table heavy domains such as financial decision making. In this work, we present a novel Langchain-based framework that transforms data tables into hierarchical textual data chunks to enable a wide variety of actionable question answering. First, the user-queries are classified by intention followed by automated retrieval of the most relevant data chunks to generate customized LLM prompts per query. Next, the custom prompts and their responses undergo multi-metric scoring to assess for hallucinations and response confidence. The proposed system is optimized with user-query intention classification, advanced prompting, data scaling capabilities and it achieves over 90% confidence scores for a variety of user-queries responses ranging from {What, Where, Why, How, predict, trend, anomalies, exceptions} that are crucial for financial decision making applications. The proposed data to answers framework can be extended to other analytical domains such as sales and payroll to ensure optimal hallucination control guardrails. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07593",
        "abstract": "A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e., prompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow. However, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of commonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful information that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance, they may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and wrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions (FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each dataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target classes. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that differentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial ambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD consistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated descriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an effective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly degrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class descriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot adaptation methods. "

MLLMs demonstrate capabilities like generating image narratives and answering image-based questions, bridging the gap towards real-world human-computer interactions and hinting at a potential pathway to artificial general intelligence. However, MLLMs still face challenges in processing the semantic gap in multimodality, which may lead to erroneous generation, posing potential risks to society. Choosing the appropriate modality alignment method is crucial, as improper methods might require more parameters with limited performance improvement. This paper aims to explore modality alignment methods for LLMs and their existing capabilities. Implementing modality alignment allows LLMs to address environmental issues and enhance accessibility. The study surveys existing modal alignment methods in MLLMs into four groups: (1) Multimodal Converters that change data into something LLMs can understand; (2) Multimodal Perceivers to improve how LLMs perceive different types of data; (3) Tools Assistance for changing data into one common format, usually text; and (4) Data-Driven methods that teach LLMs to understand specific types of data in a dataset. This field is still in a phase of exploration and experimentation, and we will organize and update various existing research methods for multimodal information alignment. "

The manuscript demonstrates the performance of the proposed methods on a real-world claim frequency dataset and compares them with several benchmark models such as generalized linear models, feed-forward neural networks, combined actuarial neural networks, LocalGLMnet, and pure feature tokenizer transformer. The paper shows that the new methods can achieve better results than the benchmark models while preserving certain generalized linear model advantages.

Among the myriad of applications that benefit from LLMs, automated code generation is increasingly promising. The potential to transform natural language prompts into executable code promises a major shift in software development practices and paves the way for significant reductions in manual coding efforts and the likelihood of human-induced errors. This paper reports the results of a study that evaluates the performance of various LLMs, such as Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Claude-2, in generating Python for coding problems. We focus on how levels of prompt specificity impact the accuracy, time efficiency, and space efficiency of the generated code. A benchmark of 104 coding problems, each with four types of prompts with varying degrees of tests and specificity, was employed to examine these aspects comprehensively. Our results indicate significant variations in performance across different LLMs and prompt types, and its key contribution is to reveal the ideal prompting strategy for creating accurate Python functions. This study lays the groundwork for further research in LLM capabilities and suggests practical implications for utilizing LLMs in automated code generation tasks and test-driven development. "

Without interventions, these biases could propagate a distorted worldview and limit opportunities for minority groups. In this work, we frame fairness as a distributional alignment problem. Our solution consists of two main technical contributions: (1) a distributional alignment loss that steers specific characteristics of the generated images towards a user-defined target distribution, and (2) biased direct finetuning of diffusion model's sampling process, which leverages a biased gradient to more effectively optimize losses defined on the generated images. Empirically, our method markedly reduces gender, racial, and their intersectional biases for occupational prompts. Gender bias is significantly reduced even when finetuning just five soft tokens. Crucially, our method supports diverse perspectives of fairness beyond absolute equality, which is demonstrated by controlling age to a $75\\%$ young and $25\\%$ old distribution while simultaneously debiasing gender and race. Finally, our method is scalable: it can debias multiple concepts at once by simply including these prompts in the finetuning data. We hope our work facilitates the social alignment of T2I generative AI. We will share code and various debiased diffusion model adaptors. "

Here, we perform a critical inquiry into this claim by evaluating the mathematical understanding of the GPT-4 model. Considering that GPT-4's training set is a secret, it is not straightforward to evaluate whether the model's correct answers are based on a mathematical understanding or based on replication of proofs that the model has seen before. We specifically craft mathematical questions which their formal proofs are not readily available on the web, proofs that are more likely not seen by the GPT-4. We see that GPT-4 is unable to solve those problems despite their simplicity. It is hard to find scientific evidence suggesting that GPT-4 has acquired an understanding of even basic mathematical concepts. A straightforward way to find failure modes of GPT-4 in theorem proving is to craft questions where their formal proofs are not available on the web. Our finding suggests that GPT-4's ability is to reproduce, rephrase, and polish the mathematical proofs that it has seen before, and not in grasping mathematical concepts. We also see that GPT-4's ability to prove mathematical theorems is continuously expanding over time despite the claim that it is a fixed model. We suggest that the task of proving mathematical theorems in formal language is comparable to the methods used in search engines such as Google while predicting the next word in a sentence may be a misguided approach, a recipe that often leads to excessive extrapolation and eventual failures. Prompting the GPT-4 over and over may benefit the GPT-4 and the OpenAI, but we question whether it is valuable for machine learning or for theorem proving. "

Current ZS-CIR research mainly relies on two unlabeled pre-trained models: the vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, and the Pic2Word/textual inversion model. However, the pre-trained models and CIR tasks have substantial discrepancies, where the pre-trained models learn the similarities between vision and language but CIR aims to learn the modifications of the image guided by text. In this paper, we introduce a novel unlabeled and pre-trained masked tuning approach to reduce the gap between the pre-trained model and the downstream CIR task. We first reformulate the pre-trained vision-language contrastive learning as the CIR task, where we randomly mask input image patches to generate $\\langle$masked image, text, image$\\rangle$ triple from an image-text pair. Then, we propose a masked tuning, which uses the text and the masked image to learn the modifications of the original image. With such a simple design, it can learn to capture fine-grained text-guided modifications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the baseline models on three ZS-CIR datasets, including FashionIQ, CIRR, and CIRCO. "

While effective, manual red-teaming is costly, and existing automatic red-teaming typically discovers safety risks without addressing them. In this paper, we propose a Multi-round Automatic Red-Teaming (MART) method, which incorporates both automatic adversarial prompt writing and safe response generation, significantly increasing red-teaming scalability and the safety of the target LLM. Specifically, an adversarial LLM and a target LLM interplay with each other in an iterative manner, where the adversarial LLM aims to generate challenging prompts that elicit unsafe responses from the target LLM, while the target LLM is fine-tuned with safety aligned data on these adversarial prompts. In each round, the adversarial LLM crafts better attacks on the updated target LLM, while the target LLM also improves itself through safety fine-tuning. On adversarial prompt benchmarks, the violation rate of an LLM with limited safety alignment reduces up to 84.7% after 4 rounds of MART, achieving comparable performance to LLMs with extensive adversarial prompt writing. Notably, model helpfulness on non-adversarial prompts remains stable throughout iterations, indicating the target LLM maintains strong performance on instruction following. "

This paper addresses these shortcomings in VAEs by reformulating the objective function associated with VAEs in order to match the aggregate/marginal posterior distribution to the prior. We use kernel density estimate (KDE) to model the aggregate posterior in high dimensions. The proposed method is named the \\emph{aggregate variational autoencoder} (AVAE) and is built on the theoretical framework of the VAE. Empirical evaluation of the proposed method on multiple benchmark data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the AVAE relative to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have opened up enormous opportunities while simultaneously posing ethical dilemmas. One of the major concerns is their ability to create text that closely mimics human writing, which can lead to potential misuse, such as academic misconduct, disinformation, and fraud. To address this problem, we present AuthentiGPT, an efficient classifier that distinguishes between machine-generated and human-written texts. Under the assumption that human-written text resides outside the distribution of machine-generated text, AuthentiGPT leverages a black-box LLM to denoise input text with artificially added noise, and then semantically compares the denoised text with the original to determine if the content is machine-generated. With only one trainable parameter, AuthentiGPT eliminates the need for a large training dataset, watermarking the LLM's output, or computing the log-likelihood. Importantly, the detection capability of AuthentiGPT can be easily adapted to any generative language model. With a 0.918 AUROC score on a domain-specific dataset, AuthentiGPT demonstrates its effectiveness over other commercial algorithms, highlighting its potential for detecting machine-generated text in academic settings.

To better understand how reward models generalize, we craft 69 distribution shifts spanning 8 categories. We find that reward models do not learn to evaluate `instruction-following' by default and instead favor personas that resemble internet text. Techniques for interpreting reward models' internal representations achieve better generalization than standard fine-tuning, but still frequently fail to distinguish instruction-following from conflated behaviors. We consolidate the 15 most challenging distribution shifts into the GENaralization analogIES (GENIES) benchmark, which we hope will enable progress toward controlling reward model generalization. "

        "abstract": "Personal sound zone (PSZ) systems, which aim to create listening (bright) and silent (dark) zones in neighboring regions of space, are often based on time-varying acoustics. Conventional adaptive-based methods for handling PSZ tasks suffer from the collection and processing of acoustic transfer functions~(ATFs) between all the matching microphones and all the loudspeakers in a centralized manner, resulting in high calculation complexity and costly accuracy requirements. This paper presents a distributed pressure-matching (PM) method relying on diffusion adaptation (DPM-D) to spread the computational load amongst nodes in order to overcome these issues. The global PM problem is defined as a sum of local costs, and the diffusion adaption approach is then used to create a distributed solution that just needs local information exchanges. Simulations over multi-frequency bins and a computational complexity analysis are conducted to evaluate the properties of the algorithm and to compare it with centralized counterparts. "

To facilitate research on this new task, we extend the AmodalSynthDrive dataset to include pixel-level labels for amodal optical flow estimation. We present several strong baselines, along with the Amodal Flow Quality metric to quantify the performance in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, we propose the novel AmodalFlowNet as an initial step toward addressing this task. AmodalFlowNet consists of a transformer-based cost-volume encoder paired with a recurrent transformer decoder which facilitates recurrent hierarchical feature propagation and amodal semantic grounding. We demonstrate the tractability of amodal optical flow in extensive experiments and show its utility for downstream tasks such as panoptic tracking.

        "abstract": "Integrating information from multiple modalities is arguably one of the essential prerequisites for grounding artificial intelligence systems with an understanding of the real world. Recent advances in video transformers that jointly learn from vision, text, and sound over time have made some progress toward this goal, but the degree to which these models integrate information from modalities still remains unclear. In this work, we present a promising approach for probing a pre-trained multimodal video transformer model by leveraging neuroscientific evidence of multimodal information processing in the brain. Using brain recordings of participants watching a popular TV show, we analyze the effects of multi-modal connections and interactions in a pre-trained multi-modal video transformer on the alignment with uni- and multi-modal brain regions. We find evidence that vision enhances masked prediction performance during language processing, providing support that cross-modal representations in models can benefit individual modalities. However, we don't find evidence of brain-relevant information captured by the joint multi-modal transformer representations beyond that captured by all of the individual modalities. We finally show that the brain alignment of the pre-trained joint representation can be improved by fine-tuning using a task that requires vision-language inferences. Overall, our results paint an optimistic picture of the ability of multi-modal transformers to integrate vision and language in partially brain-relevant ways but also show that improving the brain alignment of these models may require new approaches.

The alignment of these models to human values is an essential concern in order to establish trust that we have safe and responsible systems. In this paper, we aim to find out which values and principles are embedded in LLMs in the process of moral justification. For this purpose, we come up with three different moral perspective categories: Western tradition perspective (WT), Abrahamic tradition perspective (AT), and Spiritualist/Mystic tradition perspective (SMT). In two different experiment settings, we asked models to choose principles from the three for suggesting a moral action and evaluating the moral permissibility of an action if one tries to justify an action on these categories, respectively. Our experiments indicate that tested LLMs favors the Western tradition moral perspective over others. Additionally, we observe that there potentially exists an over-alignment towards religious values represented in the Abrahamic Tradition, which causes models to fail to recognize an action is immoral if it is presented as a \"religious-action\". We believe that these results are essential in order to direct our attention in future efforts. "

        "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) is now a common method for supervising large language models (LLMs): given labeled examples in the input context, the LLM learns to perform the task without weight updates. Despite ICL's prevalence and utility, we understand little about whether models supervised in this manner represent the underlying structure of their tasks, rather than superficial heuristics that only generalize to identically distributed examples. In this study, we investigate the robustness of LLMs supervised via ICL using the test case of sensitivity to syntax, which is a prerequisite for robust language understanding. Our experiments are based on two simple and well-controlled syntactic transformations tasks, where correct out-of-distribution generalization requires an accurate syntactic analysis of the input. We further investigate whether out-of-distribution generalization can be improved via chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is provided with a sequence of intermediate computation steps that illustrate how the task ought to be performed. In experiments with models from the GPT, PaLM, and Llama 2 families, we find large variance across LMs on this fundamental linguistic phenomenon, and that the variance is explained more by the composition of the pre-training corpus and supervision methods than by model size. In particular, we find evidence that models pre-trained on code generalize better, and benefit to a greater extent from chain-of-thought prompting. "

        "abstract": "Verifiable generation aims to let the large language model (LLM) generate text with corresponding supporting documents, which enables the user to flexibly verify the answer and makes it more trustworthy. Its evaluation not only measures the correctness of the answer, but also the answer's verifiability, i.e., how well the answer is supported by the corresponding documents. In typical, verifiable generation adopts the retrieval-read pipeline, which is divided into two stages: 1) retrieve relevant documents of the question. 2) according to the documents, generate the corresponding answer. Since the retrieved documents can supplement knowledge for the LLM to generate the answer and serve as evidence, the retrieval stage is essential for the correctness and verifiability of the answer. However, the widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit the overall performance. They often have fewer parameters than the large language model and have not been proven to scale well to the size of LLMs. Since the LLM passively receives the retrieval result, if the retriever does not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable abilities. In this paper, we propose LLatrieval (Large Language Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it verifies that the retrieved documents can support answering the question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and facilitate the retrieval result to sufficiently support verifiable generation. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms extensive baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results. "

BYOKG draws inspiration from the remarkable ability of humans to comprehend information present in an unseen KG through exploration -- starting at random nodes, inspecting the labels of adjacent nodes and edges, and combining them with their prior world knowledge. In BYOKG, exploration leverages an LLM-backed symbolic agent that generates a diverse set of query-program exemplars, which are then used to ground a retrieval-augmented reasoning procedure to predict programs for arbitrary questions. BYOKG is effective over both small- and large-scale graphs, showing dramatic gains in QA accuracy over a zero-shot baseline of 27.89 and 58.02 F1 on GrailQA and MetaQA, respectively. On GrailQA, we further show that our unsupervised BYOKG outperforms a supervised in-context learning method, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploration.

        "abstract": "In pathology, the rarity of certain diseases and the complexity in annotating pathological images significantly hinder the creation of extensive, high-quality datasets. This limitation impedes the progress of deep learning-assisted diagnostic systems in pathology. Consequently, it becomes imperative to devise a technology that can discern new disease categories from a minimal number of annotated examples. Such a technology would substantially advance deep learning models for rare diseases. Addressing this need, we introduce the Dual-channel Prototype Network (DCPN), rooted in the few-shot learning paradigm, to tackle the challenge of classifying pathological images with limited samples. DCPN augments the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) framework for few-shot classification via self-supervised learning and integrates it with convolutional neural networks. This combination forms a dual-channel architecture that extracts multi-scale, highly precise pathological features. The approach enhances the versatility of prototype representations and elevates the efficacy of prototype networks in few-shot pathological image classification tasks. We evaluated DCPN using three publicly available pathological datasets, configuring small-sample classification tasks that mirror varying degrees of clinical scenario domain shifts. Our experimental findings robustly affirm DCPN's superiority in few-shot pathological image classification, particularly in tasks within the same domain, where it achieves the benchmarks of supervised learning.

While some existing work focus on evaluating large language model's performance on retrieving and answering questions from documents, assessing the LLMs' performance on QA types that require exact answer selection from predefined options and numerical extraction is yet to be fully assessed. In this paper, we specifically focus on this underexplored context and conduct empirical analysis of LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT 3.5) on question types, including single-choice, yes-no, multiple-choice, and number extraction questions from documents. We use the Cogtale dataset for evaluation, which provide human expert-tagged responses, offering a robust benchmark for precision and factual grounding. We found that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can precisely answer many single-choice and yes-no questions given relevant context, demonstrating their efficacy in information retrieval tasks. However, their performance diminishes when confronted with multiple-choice and number extraction formats, lowering the overall performance of the model on this task, indicating that these models may not be reliable for the task. This limits the applications of LLMs on applications demanding precise information extraction from documents, such as meta-analysis tasks. However, these findings hinge on the assumption that the retrievers furnish pertinent context necessary for accurate responses, emphasizing the need for further research on the efficacy of retriever mechanisms in enhancing question-answering performance.

        "abstract": "Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in their ability to generate synthetic query-document pairs by prompting with as few as 8 demonstrations. This has enabled building better IR models, especially for tasks with no training data readily available. Typically, such synthetic query generation (QGen) approaches condition on an input context (e.g. a text document) and generate a query relevant to that context, or condition the QGen model additionally on the relevance label (e.g. relevant vs irrelevant) to generate queries across relevance buckets. However, we find that such QGen approaches are sub-optimal as they require the model to reason about the desired label and the input from a handful of examples. In this work, we propose to reduce this burden of LLMs by generating queries simultaneously for different labels. We hypothesize that instead of asking the model to generate, say, an irrelevant query given an input context, asking the model to generate an irrelevant query relative to a relevant query is a much simpler task setup for the model to reason about. Extensive experimentation across seven IR datasets shows that synthetic queries generated in such a fashion translates to a better downstream performance, suggesting that the generated queries are indeed of higher quality.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called PCFG-NAT, which leverages a specially designed Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) to enhance the ability of NAT models to capture complex dependencies among output tokens. Experimental results on major machine translation benchmarks demonstrate that PCFG-NAT further narrows the gap in translation quality between NAT and AT models.

Distilling these capabilities into a smaller, compact model can facilitate the creation of specialized, cost-effective models tailored for specific tasks. However, smaller models often face challenges in complex reasoning tasks and often deviate from the correct reasoning path. We show that LLMs can guide smaller models and bring them back to the correct reasoning path only if they intervene at the right time. We show that smaller models fail to reason primarily due to their difficulty in initiating the process, and that guiding them in the right direction can lead to a performance gain of over 100%. We explore different model sizes and evaluate the benefits of providing guidance to improve reasoning in smaller models. "

        "abstract": "Loop invariants are fundamental to reasoning about programs with loops. They establish properties about a given loop's behavior. When they additionally are inductive, they become useful for the task of formal verification that seeks to establish strong mathematical guarantees about program's runtime behavior. The inductiveness ensures that the invariants can be checked locally without consulting the entire program, thus are indispensable artifacts in a formal proof of correctness. Finding inductive loop invariants is an undecidable problem, and despite a long history of research towards practical solutions, it remains far from a solved problem. This paper investigates the capabilities of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in offering a new solution towards this old, yet important problem. To that end, we first curate a dataset of verification problems on programs with loops. Next, we design a prompt for exploiting LLMs, obtaining inductive loop invariants, that are checked for correctness using sound symbolic tools. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of using an efficient combination of a symbolic tool and an LLM on our dataset and compare it against a purely symbolic baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can help improve the state-of-the-art in automated program verification. "

        "abstract": "Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications of self-verification methods. "

Recently, researchers have shown how in-context learning performs well in bug detection and repair. In this paper, we propose code-pair classification task in which both the buggy and non-buggy versions are given to the model, and the model identifies the buggy ones. We evaluate our task in real-world dataset of bug detection and two most powerful LLMs. Our experiments indicate that an LLM can often pick the buggy from the non-buggy version of the code, and the code-pair classification task is much easier compared to be given a snippet and deciding if and where a bug exists.

A popular concept, referred to as self-refinement, postulates that LLMs can detect and correct the errors in their generations when asked to do so. However, recent empirical evidence points in the opposite direction, suggesting that LLMs often struggle to accurately identify errors when reasoning is involved. To address this, we propose a reasoning with refinement objective called ART: Ask, Refine, and Trust, which asks necessary questions to decide when an LLM should refine its output, and either affirm or withhold trust in its refinement by ranking the refinement and the initial prediction. On two multistep reasoning tasks of mathematical word problems (GSM8K) and question answering (StrategyQA), ART achieves a performance gain of +5 points over self-refinement baselines, while using a much smaller model as the decision maker. We also demonstrate the benefit of using smaller models to make refinement decisions as a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning a larger model. "

Additionally, they have been widely adopted as language-model-as-a-service commercial APIs like GPT-4 API. However, their performance on African languages is largely unknown. We present an analysis of three popular large language models (mT0, LLaMa 2, and GPT-4) on five tasks (news topic classification, sentiment classification, machine translation, question answering, and named entity recognition) across 30 African languages, spanning different language families and geographical regions. Our results suggest that all LLMs produce below-par performance on African languages, and there is a large gap in performance compared to high-resource languages like English most tasks. We find that GPT-4 has an average or impressive performance on classification tasks but very poor results on generative tasks like machine translation. Surprisingly, we find that mT0 had the best overall on cross-lingual QA, better than the state-of-the-art supervised model (i.e. fine-tuned mT5) and GPT-4 on African languages. Overall, LLaMa 2 records the worst performance due to its limited multilingual capabilities and English-centric pre-training corpus. In general, our findings present a call-to-action to ensure African languages are well represented in large language models, given their growing popularity. "

        "abstract": "Urbanization has underscored the importance of understanding the pedestrian wind environment in urban and architectural design contexts. Pedestrian Wind Comfort (PWC) focuses on the effects of wind on the safety and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists, given the influence of urban structures on the local microclimate. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods used for PWC analysis have limitations in computation, cost, and time. Deep-learning models have the potential to significantly speed up this process. The prevailing state-of-the-art methodologies largely rely on GAN-based models, such as pix2pix, which have exhibited training instability issues. In contrast, our work introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach based on the U-Net architecture, offering a more stable and streamlined solution. The process of generating a wind flow prediction at pedestrian level is reformulated from a 3D CFD simulation into a 2D image-to-image translation task, using the projected building heights as input. Testing on standard consumer hardware shows that our model can efficiently predict wind velocities in urban settings in real time. Further tests on different configurations of the model, combined with a Pareto front analysis, helped identify the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. This CNN-based approach provides a fast and efficient method for PWC analysis, potentially aiding in more efficient urban design processes. "

        "abstract": "Change detection has always been a concerned task in the interpretation of remote sensing images. It is essentially a unique binary classification task with two inputs, and there is a change relationship between these two inputs. At present, the mining of change relationship features is usually implicit in the network architectures that contain single-branch or two-branch encoders. However, due to the lack of artificial prior design for change relationship features, these networks cannot learn enough change semantic information and lose more accurate change detection performance. So we propose a network architecture NAME for the explicit mining of change relation features. In our opinion, the change features of change detection should be divided into pre-changed image features, post-changed image features and change relation features. In order to fully mine these three kinds of change features, we propose the triple branch network combining the transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract and fuse these change features from two perspectives of global information and local information, respectively. In addition, we design the continuous change relation (CCR) branch to further obtain the continuous and detail change relation features to improve the change discrimination capability of the model. The experimental results show that our network performs better, in terms of F1, IoU, and OA, than those of the existing advanced networks for change detection on four public very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing datasets.

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for fine-tuning called F-Learning (Forgetting before Learning), which is based on parametric arithmetic to achieve forgetting of old knowledge and learning of new knowledge. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed F-Learning can obviously improve the knowledge updating performance of both full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning. Moreover, we have also discovered that forgetting old knowledge by subtracting the parameters of LoRA can achieve a similar effect to subtracting the parameters of full fine-tuning, and sometimes even surpass it significantly.

To mitigate this issue, previous methods require additional preference annotation on generated samples to adapt the shifted distribution, which consumes a large amount of annotation resources. Targeting more efficient human preference optimization, we propose an adversarial preference optimization (APO) framework, where the LLM agent and the preference model update alternatively via a min-max game. Without additional annotation, our APO method can make a self-adaption to the generation distribution gap through the adversarial learning process. In experiments, we empirically verify the effectiveness of APO in improving LLM's helpfulness and harmlessness compared with rejection sampling baselines. "

        "abstract": "Analogical reasoning derives information from known relations and generalizes this information to similar yet unfamiliar situations. One of the first generalized ways in which deep learning models were able to solve verbal analogies was through vector arithmetic of word embeddings, essentially relating words that were mapped to a vector space (e.g., king - man + woman = __?). In comparison, most attempts to solve visual analogies are still predominantly task-specific and less generalizable. This project focuses on visual analogical reasoning and applies the initial generalized mechanism used to solve verbal analogies to the visual realm. Taking the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as an example to investigate visual analogy solving, we use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to transform ARC items into low-dimensional latent vectors, analogous to the word embeddings used in the verbal approaches. Through simple vector arithmetic, underlying rules of ARC items are discovered and used to solve them. Results indicate that the approach works well on simple items with fewer dimensions (i.e., few colors used, uniform shapes), similar input-to-output examples, and high reconstruction accuracy on the VAE. Predictions on more complex items showed stronger deviations from expected outputs, although, predictions still often approximated parts of the item's rule set. Error patterns indicated that the model works as intended. On the official ARC paradigm, the model achieved a score of 2% (cf. current world record is 21%) and on ConceptARC it scored 8.8%. Although the methodology proposed involves basic dimensionality reduction techniques and standard vector arithmetic, this approach demonstrates promising outcomes on ARC and can easily be generalized to other abstract visual reasoning tasks.

With the emergence of deep learning models, it has become very popular to represent the skeleton data in pseudo-image form and apply Convolutional Neural Networks for action recognition. Thereafter, studies concentrated on finding effective methods for forming pseudo-images. Recently, attention networks, more specifically transformers have provided promising results in various vision problems. In this study, the effectiveness of vision transformers for skeleton-based action recognition is examined and its robustness on the pseudo-image representation scheme is investigated. To this end, a three-level architecture, Act-VIT is proposed, which forms a set of pseudo images apply a classifier on each of the representation and combine their results to find the final action class. The classifiers of Act-VIT are first realized by CNNs and then by VITs and their performances are compared. Experimental studies reveal that the vision transformer is less sensitive to the initial pseudo-image representation compared to CNN. Nevertheless, even with the vision transformer, the recognition performance can be further improved by consensus of classifiers. "

Our proposed SAIE training method involves both supportive and adversarial discussions between the learner and partner models. The learner model receives a remark from the partner through the discussion, and the parameters of the learner model are then updated based on this remark. That is, the teacher signal dynamically adjusts in response to the evolving model output throughout the training step. By bolstering the capacity for discussion and comprehension of instances, our experiments across datasets, including GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and MMLU, reveal that models fine-tuned with our method consistently surpass those trained with standard fine-tuning techniques.

        "abstract": "LLMs and AI chatbots have improved people's efficiency in various fields. However, the necessary knowledge for answering the question may be beyond the models' knowledge boundaries. To mitigate this issue, many researchers try to introduce external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs and Internet contents, into LLMs for up-to-date information. However, the external information from the Internet may include counterfactual information that will confuse the model and lead to an incorrect response. Thus there is a pressing need for LLMs to possess the ability to distinguish reliable information from external knowledge. Therefore, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to discern the reliability of external knowledge, we create a benchmark from existing knowledge bases. Our benchmark consists of two tasks, Question Answering and Text Generation, and for each task, we provide models with a context containing counterfactual information. Evaluation results show that existing LLMs are susceptible to interference from unreliable external knowledge with counterfactual information, and simple intervention methods make limited contributions to the alleviation of this issue.

        "abstract": "Existing works on weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing adopt hybrid attention network (HAN) as the multi-modal embedding to capture the cross-modal context. It embeds the audio and visual modalities with a shared network, where the cross-attention is performed at the input. However, such an early fusion method highly entangles the two non-fully correlated modalities and leads to sub-optimal performance in detecting single-modality events. To deal with this problem, we propose the messenger-guided mid-fusion transformer to reduce the uncorrelated cross-modal context in the fusion. The messengers condense the full cross-modal context into a compact representation to only preserve useful cross-modal information. Furthermore, due to the fact that microphones capture audio events from all directions, while cameras only record visual events within a restricted field of view, there is a more frequent occurrence of unaligned cross-modal context from audio for visual event predictions. We thus propose cross-audio prediction consistency to suppress the impact of irrelevant audio information on visual event prediction. Experiments consistently illustrate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. "

We introduce a multi-agent collaboration strategy that emulates the academic peer review process. Each agent independently constructs its own solution, provides reviews on the solutions of others, and assigns confidence levels to its reviews. Upon receiving peer reviews, agents revise their initial solutions. Extensive experiments on three different types of reasoning tasks show that our collaboration approach delivers superior accuracy across all ten datasets compared to existing methods. Further study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating confidence in the reviews for math reasoning, and suggests a promising direction for human-mimicking multi-agent collaboration process. "

        "abstract": "Large-scale language models have made great progress in the field of software engineering in recent years. They can be used for many code-related tasks such as code clone detection, code-to-code search, and method name prediction. However, these large-scale language models based on each code token have several drawbacks: They are usually large in scale, heavily dependent on labels, and require a lot of computing power and time to fine-tune new datasets.Furthermore, code embedding should be performed on the entire code snippet rather than encoding each code token. The main reason for this is that encoding each code token would cause model parameter inflation, resulting in a lot of parameters storing information that we are not very concerned about. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called TransformCode, that learns about code embeddings in a contrastive learning manner. The framework uses the Transformer encoder as an integral part of the model. We also introduce a novel data augmentation technique called abstract syntax tree transformation: This technique applies syntactic and semantic transformations to the original code snippets to generate more diverse and robust anchor samples. Our proposed framework is both flexible and adaptable: It can be easily extended to other downstream tasks that require code representation such as code clone detection and classification. The framework is also very efficient and scalable: It does not require a large model or a large amount of training data, and can support any programming language.Finally, our framework is not limited to unsupervised learning, but can also be applied to some supervised learning tasks by incorporating task-specific labels or objectives. To explore the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted extensive experiments on different software engineering tasks using different programming languages and multiple datasets. "

While emerging AI methods can provide effective approaches to solve end-to-end problems, for instance via the use of deep surrogate models or various data analytics strategies, they often lack physical intuition since knowledge is baked into the parametric complement through training, offering less flexibility when it comes to incorporating mathematical or physical insights. By leveraging diverse capabilities of multiple dynamically interacting large language models (LLMs), we can overcome the limitations of conventional approaches and develop a new class of physics-inspired generative machine learning platform, here referred to as MechAgents. A set of AI agents can solve mechanics tasks, here demonstrated for elasticity problems, via autonomous collaborations. A two-agent team can effectively write, execute and self-correct code, in order to apply finite element methods to solve classical elasticity problems in various flavors (different boundary conditions, domain geometries, meshes, small/finite deformation and linear/hyper-elastic constitutive laws, and others). For more complex tasks, we construct a larger group of agents with enhanced division of labor among planning, formulating, coding, executing and criticizing the process and results. The agents mutually correct each other to improve the overall team-work performance in understanding, formulating and validating the solution. Our framework shows the potential of synergizing the intelligence of language models, the reliability of physics-based modeling, and the dynamic collaborations among diverse agents, opening novel avenues for automation of solving engineering problems.

We consider these characteristics as the foundational principles for constructing vision-language instruction data and propose a complete construction pipeline consisting of data collection, instruction generation, and quality control modules that incorporate meticulously designed instruction property evaluation indicators.

In this process, a model iteratively augments its training subset to refine its own performance, without requiring any intervention from humans or more advanced LLMs. The key to our data sampling technique lies in the enhancement of diversity in the chosen subsets, as the model selects new data points most distinct from any existing ones according to its current embedding space. Extensive experiments across three datasets and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DiverseEvol. Our models, trained on less than 8% of the original dataset, maintain or improve performance compared with finetuning on full data. We also provide empirical evidence to analyze the importance of diversity in instruction data and the iterative scheme as opposed to one-time sampling.

Over the last few years, research on Scientific Information Extraction (SciIE) witnessed the release of several new systems and benchmarks.

Moreover, core information can be present in either text or tables or across both. To close this gap in data availability and enable cross-modality IE, while alleviating labeling costs, we propose a semi-supervised pipeline for annotating entities in text, as well as entities and relations in tables, in an iterative procedure. Based on this pipeline, we release novel resources for the scientific community, including a high-quality benchmark, a large-scale corpus, and a semi-supervised annotation pipeline.

        "abstract": "Recently, multi-modal content generation has attracted lots of attention from researchers by investigating the utilization of visual instruction tuning based on large language models (LLMs). To enhance the performance and generalization ability of such LLMs, the practice of distilling knowledge from pretrained multi-modal models (a.k.a. teachers) to more compact multi-modal LLMs (students) has gained considerable interest. However, the prevailing paradigm of instructiontuning in multi-modal LLMs knowledge distillation is resource-intensive and unidirectional, neglecting the potential for mutual feedback between the student and teacher models. Thus, we propose an innovative Competitive Multi-modal Distillation framework (CoMD), which captures bidirectional feedback between teacher and student models and continually updates the multi-modal capabilities that the student model has learned. It comprises two stages: multi-modal pre-training and multi-modal competitive distillation. The first stage pre-trains the student model on a large number of filtered multi-modal datasets. The second stage facilitates a bidirectional knowledge transfer between the student and teacher models. Our experimental analysis of diverse datasets shows that our knowledge transfer method consistently improves the capabilities of the student model. Finally, the 7B-sized student model after four distillations surpassed the current state-of-the-art model LLaVA-13B on the ScienceQA and LLaVA Test dataset, also outperforms other strong baselines in the zero-shot setting.

When there are few images available for training (e.g. 10 images), Learning From Scratch (LFS) methods often generate images that closely resemble the training data while Transfer Learning (TL) methods try to improve performance by leveraging prior knowledge from GANs pre-trained on large-scale datasets. However, current TL methods may not allow for sufficient control over the degree of knowledge preservation from the source model, making them unsuitable for setups where the source and target domains are not closely related. To address this, we propose a novel pipeline called Peer is your Pillar (PIP), which combines a target few-shot dataset with a peer dataset to create a data-unbalanced conditional generation. Our approach includes a class embedding method that separates the class space from the latent space, and we use a direction loss based on pre-trained CLIP to improve image diversity.

We believe this inconsistency arises because the traditional metrics are not well-suited for evaluating generative models. Their overly strict length and phonics constraints may lead to underestimating ChatGPT's correction capabilities. To better evaluate generative models in the CSC task, this paper proposes a new evaluation metric: Eval-GCSC. By incorporating word-level and semantic similarity judgments, it relaxes the stringent length and phonics constraints. Experimental results show that Eval-GCSC closely aligns with human evaluations. Under this metric, ChatGPT's performance is comparable to traditional token-level classification models (TCM), demonstrating its potential as a CSC tool.

Nevertheless, they are essentially black boxes: Humans do not have a clear understanding of what knowledge is encoded in different parts of the models, especially in individual neurons. The situation is different in computer vision, where feature visualization provides a decompositional interpretability technique for neurons of vision models. Activation maximization is used to synthesize inherently interpretable visual representations of the information encoded in individual neurons. Our work is inspired by this but presents a cautionary tale on the interpretability of single neurons, based on the first large-scale attempt to adapt activation maximization to NLP, and, more specifically, large PLMs. We propose feature textualization, a technique to produce dense representations of neurons in the PLM word embedding space. We apply feature textualization to the BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019) to investigate whether the knowledge encoded in individual neurons can be interpreted and symbolized. We find that the produced representations can provide insights about the knowledge encoded in individual neurons, but that individual neurons do not represent clearcut symbolic units of language such as words. Additionally, we use feature textualization to investigate how many neurons are needed to encode words in BERT. "

In this work, we propose an LLM-driven interactive multimodal multitask robot navigation framework, termed LIM2N, to solve the above new challenge in the navigation field. We achieve this by first introducing a multimodal interaction framework where language and hand-drawn inputs can serve as navigation constraints and control objectives. Next, a reinforcement learning agent is built to handle multiple tasks with the received information. Crucially, LIM2N creates smooth cooperation among the reasoning of multimodal input, multitask planning, and adaptation and processing of the intelligent sensing modules in the complicated system.

In FastCoT, the parallel decoding part provides the LLM with a quick glance of the future composed of approximate tokens, which could lead to faster answers compared to regular autoregressive decoding used by causal transformers. We also provide an implementation of parallel decoding within LLM, which supports KV-cache generation and batch processing.

Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on another white-box model, compromising generalization or jailbreak efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we offer detailed analysis and discussion from the perspective of prompt execution priority on the failure of LLMs' defense.

Adopting a natural language question-answering (Q&A) scheme, we craft questions targeting nine syntactic knowledge points that are most closely related to sentence comprehension. Experiments conducted on 24 LLMs suggest that most have a limited grasp of syntactic knowledge, exhibiting notable discrepancies across different syntactic knowledge points. In particular, questions involving prepositional phrase attachment pose the greatest challenge, whereas those concerning adjectival modifier and indirect object are relatively easier for LLMs to handle. Furthermore, a case study on the training dynamics of the LLMs reveals that the majority of syntactic knowledge is learned during the initial stages of training, hinting that simply increasing the number of training tokens may not be the `silver bullet' for improving the comprehension ability of LLMs. "

        "abstract": "Transformer neural networks can exhibit a surprising capacity for in-context learning (ICL) despite not being explicitly trained for it. Prior work has provided a deeper understanding of how ICL emerges in transformers, e.g. through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, Bayesian inference, or by examining the distributional properties of training data. However, in each of these cases, ICL is treated largely as a persistent phenomenon; namely, once ICL emerges, it is assumed to persist asymptotically. Here, we show that the emergence of ICL during transformer training is, in fact, often transient. We train transformers on synthetic data designed so that both ICL and in-weights learning (IWL) strategies can lead to correct predictions. We find that ICL first emerges, then disappears and gives way to IWL, all while the training loss decreases, indicating an asymptotic preference for IWL. The transient nature of ICL is observed in transformers across a range of model sizes and datasets, raising the question of how much to \"overtrain\" transformers when seeking compact, cheaper-to-run models. We find that L2 regularization may offer a path to more persistent ICL that removes the need for early stopping based on ICL-style validation tasks. Finally, we present initial evidence that ICL transience may be caused by competition between ICL and IWL circuits. "

On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural sequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing general-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor for mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of linear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given by data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe that transformers achieve low mean-squared error on data generated via this process. By probing the transformer's output at inference time, we also show that transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal predictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn mixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust to distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving constructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed implementable by a transformer. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08369",
        "abstract": "Against the misuse (e.g., plagiarism or spreading misinformation) of Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent works have presented LLM-generated-text detectors with promising detection performance. Spotlighting a situation where users instruct LLMs to generate texts (e.g., essay writing), there are various ways to write the instruction (e.g., what task-oriented constraint to include). In this paper, we discover that even a task-oriented constraint in instruction can cause the inconsistent performance of current detectors to the generated texts. Specifically, we focus on student essay writing as a realistic domain and manually create the task-oriented constraint for each factor on essay quality by Ke and Ng (2019). Our experiment shows that the detection performance variance of the current detector on texts generated by instruction with each task-oriented constraint is up to 20 times larger than the variance caused by generating texts multiple times and paraphrasing the instruction. Our finding calls for further research on developing robust detectors that can detect such distributional shifts caused by a task-oriented constraint in the instruction. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08370",
        "abstract": "The past year has seen rapid acceleration in the development of large language models (LLMs). For many tasks, there is now a wide range of open-source and open-access LLMs that are viable alternatives to proprietary models like ChatGPT. Without proper steering and safeguards, however, LLMs will readily follow malicious instructions, provide unsafe advice, and generate toxic content. This is a critical safety risk for businesses and developers. We introduce SimpleSafetyTests as a new test suite for rapidly and systematically identifying such critical safety risks. The test suite comprises 100 test prompts across five harm areas that LLMs, for the vast majority of applications, should refuse to comply with. We test 11 popular open LLMs and find critical safety weaknesses in several of them. While some LLMs do not give a single unsafe response, most models we test respond unsafely on more than 20% of cases, with over 50% unsafe responses in the extreme. Prepending a safety-emphasising system prompt substantially reduces the occurrence of unsafe responses, but does not completely stop them from happening. We recommend that developers use such system prompts as a first line of defence against critical safety risks. "

Much like the \\textbf{Ship of Theseus paradox}, which ponders whether a ship remains the same when each of its original planks is replaced, our research delves into an intriguing question: \\textit{Does a text retain its original authorship when it undergoes numerous paraphrasing iterations?} Specifically, since Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in the generation of both original content and the modification of human-authored texts, a pivotal question emerges concerning the determination of authorship in instances where LLMs or similar paraphrasing tools are employed to rephrase the text. This inquiry revolves around \\textit{whether authorship should be attributed to the original human author or the AI-powered tool, given the tool's independent capacity to produce text that closely resembles human-generated content.} Therefore, we embark on a philosophical voyage through the seas of language and authorship to unravel this intricate puzzle.

        "abstract": "Aligning language models (LMs) with human opinion is challenging yet vital to enhance their grasp of human values, preferences, and beliefs. We present ChOiRe, a four-step solution framework to predict human opinion that differentiates between the user explicit personae (i.e. demographic or ideological attributes) that are manually declared and implicit personae inferred from user historical opinions. Specifically, it consists of (i) an LM analyzing the user explicit personae to filter out irrelevant attributes; (ii) the LM ranking the implicit persona opinions into a preferential list; (iii) Chain-of-Opinion (CoO) reasoning, where the LM sequentially analyzes the explicit personae and the most relevant implicit personae to perform opinion prediction; (iv) and where ChOiRe executes Step (iii) CoO multiple times with increasingly larger lists of implicit personae to overcome insufficient personae information to infer a final result. ChOiRe achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness with limited inference calls, improving previous LLM-based techniques significantly by 3.22%. "

        "abstract": "Text style is highly abstract, as it encompasses various aspects of a speaker's characteristics, habits, logical thinking, and the content they express. However, previous text-style transfer tasks have primarily focused on data-driven approaches, lacking in-depth analysis and research from the perspectives of linguistics and cognitive science. In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Text Speech-Style Transfer (TSST). The main objective is to further explore topics related to human cognition, such as personality and emotion, based on the capabilities of existing LLMs. Considering the objective of our task and the distinctive characteristics of oral speech in real-life scenarios, we trained multi-dimension (i.e. filler words, vividness, interactivity, emotionality) evaluation models for the TSST and validated their correlation with human assessments. We thoroughly analyze the performance of several large language models (LLMs) and identify areas where further improvement is needed. Moreover, driven by our evaluation models, we have released a new corpus that improves the capabilities of LLMs in generating text with speech-style characteristics. In summary, we present the TSST task, a new benchmark for style transfer and emphasizing human-oriented evaluation, exploring and advancing the performance of current LLMs. "

While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many other settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts. We introduce SC, a prompting approach that predicts text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons. SC begins by proposing aspects of comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect. We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise consistency comparator that ensures each aspect's comparisons clearly distinguish differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. Our comprehensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC equips LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text preference prediction.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08398",
        "abstract": "Are Large language models (LLMs) temporally grounded? Since LLMs cannot perceive and interact with the environment, it is impossible to answer this question directly. Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events). We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities. Generally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as well as small-scale, specialised LMs. In-context learning, instruction tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree. Crucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent behaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions. Contrary to expectations, we also find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in performance. To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may gather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled texts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event ordering. Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks. Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of textual narratives. Code, datasets, and LLM outputs are available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/temporal-llms. "

        "abstract": "Localizing and recognizing objects in the open-ended physical world poses a long-standing challenge within the domain of machine perception. Recent methods have endeavored to address the issue by employing a class-agnostic mask (or box) proposal model, complemented by an open-vocabulary classifier (e.g., CLIP) using pre-extracted text embeddings. However, it is worth noting that these open-vocabulary recognition models still exhibit limitations in practical applications. On one hand, they rely on the provision of class names during testing, where the recognition performance heavily depends on this predefined set of semantic classes by users. On the other hand, when training with multiple datasets, human intervention is required to alleviate the label definition conflict between them. In this paper, we introduce the OmniScient Model (OSM), a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based mask classifier, as a straightforward and effective solution to the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, OSM predicts class labels in a generative manner, thus removing the supply of class names during both training and testing. It also enables cross-dataset training without any human interference, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities due to the world knowledge acquired from the LLM. By combining OSM with an off-the-shelf mask proposal model, we present promising results on various benchmarks, and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling novel concepts.

The paper aims to serve as a guide for computational biologists and computer scientists interested in LLMs for genomic data. We hope the paper can also serve as an educational introduction and discussion for biologists to a fundamental shift in how we will be analyzing genomic data in the future. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07896",
        "abstract": "Turbulent flows have historically presented formidable challenges to predictive computational modeling. Traditional numerical simulations often require vast computational resources, making them infeasible for numerous engineering applications. As an alternative, deep learning-based surrogate models have emerged, offering data-drive solutions. However, these are typically constructed within deterministic settings, leading to shortfall in capturing the innate chaotic and stochastic behaviors of turbulent dynamics. We introduce a novel generative framework grounded in probabilistic diffusion models for versatile generation of spatiotemporal turbulence. Our method unifies both unconditional and conditional sampling strategies within a Bayesian framework, which can accommodate diverse conditioning scenarios, including those with a direct differentiable link between specified conditions and generated unsteady flow outcomes, and scenarios lacking such explicit correlations. A notable feature of our approach is the method proposed for long-span flow sequence generation, which is based on autoregressive gradient-based conditional sampling, eliminating the need for cumbersome retraining processes. We showcase the versatile turbulence generation capability of our framework through a suite of numerical experiments, including: 1) the synthesis of LES simulated instantaneous flow sequences from URANS inputs; 2) holistic generation of inhomogeneous, anisotropic wall-bounded turbulence, whether from given initial conditions, prescribed turbulence statistics, or entirely from scratch; 3) super-resolved generation of high-speed turbulent boundary layer flows from low-resolution data across a range of input resolutions. Collectively, our numerical experiments highlight the merit and transformative potential of the proposed methods, making a significant advance in the field of turbulence generation. "

        "abstract": "We present a novel diffusion-based approach to generate synthetic histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) at an unprecedented gigapixel scale. Synthetic WSIs have many potential applications: They can augment training datasets to enhance the performance of many computational pathology applications. They allow the creation of synthesized copies of datasets that can be shared without violating privacy regulations. Or they can facilitate learning representations of WSIs without requiring data annotations. Despite this variety of applications, no existing deep-learning-based method generates WSIs at their typically high resolutions. Mainly due to the high computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine sampling scheme to tackle image generation of high-resolution WSIs. In this scheme, we increase the resolution of an initial low-resolution image to a high-resolution WSI. Particularly, a diffusion model sequentially adds fine details to images and increases their resolution. In our experiments, we train our method with WSIs from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. Additionally to quantitative evaluations, we also performed a user study with pathologists. The study results suggest that our generated WSIs resemble the structure of real WSIs. "

        "abstract": "In low-bitrate speech coding, end-to-end speech coding networks aim to learn compact yet expressive features and a powerful decoder in a single network. A challenging problem as such results in unwelcome complexity increase and inferior speech quality. In this paper, we propose to separate the representation learning and information reconstruction tasks. We leverage an end-to-end codec for learning low-dimensional discrete tokens and employ a latent diffusion model to de-quantize coded features into a high-dimensional continuous space, relieving the decoder's burden of de-quantizing and upsampling. To mitigate the issue of over-smooth generation, we introduce midway-infilling with less noise reduction and stronger conditioning. In ablation studies, we investigate the hyperparameters for midway-infilling and latent diffusion space with different dimensions. Subjective listening tests show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art at two low bitrates, 1.5 and 3 kbps. Codes and samples of this work are available on our webpage. "

        "abstract": "Zero-shot audio captioning aims at automatically generating descriptive textual captions for audio content without prior training for this task. Different from speech recognition which translates audio content that contains spoken language into text, audio captioning is commonly concerned with ambient sounds, or sounds produced by a human performing an action. Inspired by zero-shot image captioning methods, we propose ZerAuCap, a novel framework for summarising such general audio signals in a text caption without requiring task-specific training. In particular, our framework exploits a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for generating the text which is guided by a pre-trained audio-language model to produce captions that describe the audio content. Additionally, we use audio context keywords that prompt the language model to generate text that is broadly relevant to sounds. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot audio captioning on the AudioCaps and Clotho datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/ZerAuCap. "
