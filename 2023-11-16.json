        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08412",
        "abstract": "Service robots need common-sense knowledge to help humans in everyday situations as it enables them to understand the context of their actions. However, approaches that use ontologies face a challenge because common-sense knowledge is often implicit, i.e., it is obvious to humans but not explicitly stated. This paper investigates if Large Language Models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Our experiments reveal limited effectiveness in the selective extraction of contextual action knowledge, suggesting that LLMs may not be sufficient on their own. However, the large-scale extraction of general, actionable knowledge shows potential, indicating that LLMs can be a suitable tool for efficiently creating ontologies for robots. This paper shows that the technique used for knowledge extraction can be applied to populate a minimalist ontology, showcasing the potential of LLMs in synergy with formal knowledge representation. "

        "abstract": "Recently, work in NLP has shifted to few-shot (in-context) learning, with large language models (LLMs) performing well across a range of tasks. However, while fairness evaluations have become a standard for supervised methods, little is known about the fairness of LLMs as prediction systems. Further, common standard methods for fairness involve access to models weights or are applied during finetuning, which are not applicable in few-shot learning. Do LLMs exhibit prediction biases when used for standard NLP tasks? In this work, we explore the effect of shots, which directly affect the performance of models, on the fairness of LLMs as NLP classification systems. We consider how different shot selection strategies, both existing and new demographically sensitive methods, affect model fairness across three standard fairness datasets. We discuss how future work can include LLM fairness evaluations. "

        "abstract": "In an industry dominated by straight men, many developers representing other gender identities and sexual orientations often encounter hateful or discriminatory messages. Such communications pose barriers to participation for women and LGBTQ+ persons. Due to sheer volume, manual inspection of all communications for discriminatory communication is infeasible for a large-scale Free Open-Source Software (FLOSS) community. To address this challenge, this study aims to develop an automated mechanism to identify Sexual orientation and Gender identity Discriminatory (SGID) texts from software developers' communications. On this goal, we trained and evaluated SGID4SE ( Sexual orientation and Gender Identity Discriminatory text identification for (4) Software Engineering texts) as a supervised learning-based SGID detection tool. SGID4SE incorporates six preprocessing steps and ten state-of-the-art algorithms. SGID4SE implements six different strategies to improve the performance of the minority class. We empirically evaluated each strategy and identified an optimum configuration for each algorithm. In our ten-fold cross-validation-based evaluations, a BERT-based model boosts the best performance with 85.9% precision, 80.0% recall, and 82.9% F1-Score for the SGID class. This model achieves 95.7% accuracy and 80.4% Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Our dataset and tool establish a foundation for further research in this direction. "

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to a multitude of applications but struggle with significant risks, notably in generating harmful content and biases. Drawing an analogy to the human psyche's conflict between evolutionary survival instincts and societal norm adherence elucidated in Freud's psychoanalysis theory, we argue that LLMs suffer a similar fundamental conflict, arising between their inherent desire for syntactic and semantic continuity, established during the pre-training phase, and the post-training alignment with human values. This conflict renders LLMs vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein intensifying the models' desire for continuity can circumvent alignment efforts, resulting in the generation of harmful information. Through a series of experiments, we first validated the existence of the desire for continuity in LLMs, and further devised a straightforward yet powerful technique, such as incomplete sentences, negative priming, and cognitive dissonance scenarios, to demonstrate that even advanced LLMs struggle to prevent the generation of harmful information. In summary, our study uncovers the root of LLMs' vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, hereby questioning the efficacy of solely relying on sophisticated alignment methods, and further advocates for a new training idea that integrates modal concepts alongside traditional amodal concepts, aiming to endow LLMs with a more nuanced understanding of real-world contexts and ethical considerations.

In this paper, we break down the self-correction process into two core components: mistake finding and output correction. For mistake finding, we release BIG-Bench Mistake, a dataset of logical mistakes in Chain-of-Thought reasoning traces. We provide benchmark numbers for several state-of-the-art LLMs, and demonstrate that LLMs generally struggle with finding logical mistakes. For output correction, we propose a backtracking method which provides large improvements when given information on mistake location. We construe backtracking as a lightweight alternative to reinforcement learning methods, and show that it remains effective with a reward model at 60-70% accuracy. "

As their applications extend into multi-agent environments, a need has arisen for a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures their abilities in reasoning, planning, collaboration, and more. This work introduces a novel benchmarking framework specifically tailored to assess LLMs within multi-agent settings, providing quantitative metrics to evaluate their judgment, reasoning, deception, self-awareness, collaboration, coordination, and rationality. We utilize games such as Chameleon and Undercover, alongside game theory scenarios like Cost Sharing, Multi-player Prisoner's Dilemma, and Public Good, to create diverse testing environments. Our framework is fortified with the Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (PGM) method, enhancing the LLMs' capabilities in navigating complex social and cognitive dimensions. The benchmark evaluates seven multi-agent systems powered by different LLMs, quantitatively highlighting a significant capability gap over threefold between the strongest, GPT-4, and the weakest, Llama-2-70B. It also confirms that our PGM enhancement boosts the inherent abilities of all selected models by 50% on average. Our codes are released here https://github.com/cathyxl/MAgIC. "

This is particularly applicable when tackling inauthentic online accounts with a fake user profile photo. We show that by focusing on only faces, a more resilient and general-purpose artifact can be detected that allows for the detection of AI-generated faces from a variety of GAN- and diffusion-based synthesis engines, and across image resolutions (as low as 128 x 128 pixels) and qualities.

        "abstract": "The injection of syntactic information in Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) has been shown to result in an overall improvement of performances and generalisation. An effective strategy to achieve such a goal is to separate the encoding of distributional semantic features and syntactic structures into heterogeneous latent spaces via multi-task learning or dual encoder architectures. However, existing works employing such techniques are limited to LSTM-based VAEs. In this paper, we investigate latent space separation methods for structural syntactic injection in Transformer-based VAE architectures (i.e., Optimus). Specifically, we explore how syntactic structures can be leveraged in the encoding stage through the integration of graph-based and sequential models, and how multiple, specialised latent representations can be injected into the decoder's attention mechanism via low-rank operators. Our empirical evaluation, carried out on natural language sentences and mathematical expressions, reveals that the proposed end-to-end VAE architecture can result in a better overall organisation of the latent space, alleviating the information loss occurring in standard VAE setups, resulting in enhanced performances on language modelling and downstream generation tasks.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on coding related tasks, particularly on assisting humans in programming and facilitating programming automation. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the code understanding and generation capacities of LLMs suffer from severe limitations. First, most benchmarks are deficient as they focus on a narrow range of popular programming languages and specific tasks, whereas the real-world software development scenarios show dire need to implement systems with multilingual programming environments to satisfy diverse requirements. Practical programming practices also strongly expect multi-task settings for testing coding capabilities of LLMs comprehensively and robustly. Second, most benchmarks also fail to consider the actual executability and the consistency of execution results of the generated code. To bridge these gaps between existing benchmarks and expectations from practical applications, we introduce CodeScope, an execution-based, multilingual, multi-task, multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark for comprehensively gauging LLM capabilities on coding tasks. CodeScope covers 43 programming languages and 8 coding tasks. It evaluates the coding performance of LLMs from three dimensions (perspectives): difficulty, efficiency, and length. To facilitate execution-based evaluations of code generation, we develop MultiCodeEngine, an automated code execution engine that supports 14 programming languages. Finally, we systematically evaluate and analyze 8 mainstream LLMs on CodeScope tasks and demonstrate the superior breadth and challenges of CodeScope for evaluating LLMs on code understanding and generation tasks compared to other benchmarks.

In a second round, the LLM is challenged with a follow-up phrase like \"Are you sure?\", offering an opportunity for the model to reflect on its initial answer, and decide whether to confirm or flip its answer. A systematic study of nine LLMs on seven classification tasks reveals that models flip their answers on average 46% of the time and that all models see a deterioration of accuracy between their first and final prediction, with an average drop of 17%. The FlipFlop experiment illustrates the universality of sycophantic behavior in LLMs and provides a robust framework to analyze model behavior and evaluate potential solutions. "

Although recent attack methods can achieve a relatively high attack success rate (ASR), our observation shows that the generated adversarial examples have a different data distribution compared with the original examples. Specifically, these adversarial examples exhibit lower confidence levels and higher distance to the training data distribution. As a result, they are easy to detect using very simple detection methods, diminishing the actual effectiveness of these attack methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Distribution-Aware LoRA-based Adversarial Attack (DALA) method, which considers the distribution shift of adversarial examples to improve attack effectiveness under detection methods. We further design a new evaluation metric NASR combining ASR and detection for the attack task. We conduct experiments on four widely-used datasets and validate the attack effectiveness on ASR and NASR of the adversarial examples generated by DALA on the BERT-base model and the black-box LLaMA2-7b model.

We break new ground by introducing the first polynomial transformer, providing the first demonstration of secure inference over HE with transformers. This includes a transformer architecture tailored for HE, alongside a novel method for converting operators to their polynomial equivalent. This innovation enables us to perform secure inference on LMs with WikiText-103. It also allows us to perform image classification with CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. Our models yield results comparable to traditional methods, bridging the performance gap with transformers of similar scale and underscoring the viability of HE for state-of-the-art applications.

The text-VQA task requires a model to answer a question by understanding multi-modal content: text (typically from OCR) and an associated image. To the best of our knowledge, almost all previous approaches for text-VQA process a single question and its associated content to predict a single answer. In order to answer multiple questions from the same image, each question and content are fed into the model multiple times. In contrast, our proposed MQMA approach takes multiple questions and content as input at the encoder and predicts multiple answers at the decoder in an auto-regressive manner at the same time. We make several novel architectural modifications to standard encoder-decoder transformers to support MQMA. We also propose a novel MQMA denoising pre-training task which is designed to teach the model to align and delineate multiple questions and content with associated answers. MQMA pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple text-VQA datasets, each with strong baselines.

Typically, the decoder takes up most of the latency because of the auto-regressive decoding. To accelerate the inference, we propose an approach of performing Dynamic Early Exit on Decoder (DEED). We build a multi-exit encoder-decoder transformer model which is trained with deep supervision so that each of its decoder layers is capable of generating plausible predictions. In addition, we leverage simple yet practical techniques, including shared generation head and adaptation modules, to keep accuracy when exiting at shallow decoder layers. Based on the multi-exit model, we perform step-level dynamic early exit during inference, where the model may decide to use fewer decoder layers based on its confidence of the current layer at each individual decoding step. Considering different number of decoder layers may be used at different decoding steps, we compute deeper-layer decoder features of previous decoding steps just-in-time, which ensures the features from different decoding steps are semantically aligned. We evaluate our approach with two state-of-the-art encoder-decoder transformer models on various VL tasks. We show our approach can reduce overall inference latency by 30%-60% with comparable or even higher accuracy compared to baselines. "

This happens when a task, such as parsing, is expensive to annotate and also unfamiliar to a pretrained LLM. In this paper, we present a discovery that student models distilled from a prompted LLM can often generalize better than their teacher on such tasks. Leveraging this finding, we propose a new distillation method, multistage collaborative knowledge distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for such tasks. MCKD first prompts an LLM using few-shot in-context learning to produce pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then, at each stage of distillation, a pair of students are trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data. Each student subsequently produces new and improved pseudolabels for the unseen partition to supervise the next round of student(s) with. We show the benefit of multistage cross-partition labeling on two constituency parsing tasks. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500 examples and outperforms the prompted LLM and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively.

Despite its outstanding performance, evidence shows that spurious correlations caused by imbalanced label distributions in training data (or exemplars in ICL) lead to robustness issues. However, previous studies mostly focus on word- and phrase-level features and fail to tackle it from the concept level, partly due to the lack of concept labels and subtle and diverse expressions of concepts in text. In this paper, we first use the LLM to label the concept for each text and then measure the concept bias of models for fine-tuning or ICL on the test data. Second, we propose a data rebalancing method to mitigate the spurious correlations by adding the LLM-generated counterfactual data to make a balanced label distribution for each concept. We verify the effectiveness of our mitigation method and show its superiority over the token removal method. Overall, our results show that there exist label distribution biases in concepts across multiple text classification datasets, and LMs will utilize these shortcuts to make predictions in both fine-tuning and ICL methods.

Combining with efficient deterministic sampler, we achieved similar Fr\\'echet audio distance (FAD) score as top-ranked baseline with only 10 steps and reached state-of-the-art performance with 50 steps on the DCASE2023 foley sound generation benchmark. We also revealed a potential concern regarding diffusion based audio generation models that they tend to generate samples with high perceptual similarity to the data from training data.

We perform extensive experiments, spanning both extractive and generative QA model designs and diverse languages, spanning both high-resource and low-resource ones. We study different dimensions of calibration in in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and cross-lingual transfer settings, and investigate strategies to improve it, including post-hoc methods and regularized fine-tuning. We demonstrate automatically translated data augmentation as a highly effective technique to improve model calibration. We also conduct a number of ablation experiments to study the effect of model size on calibration and how multilingual models compare with their monolingual counterparts for diverse tasks and languages.

It's noted that not only the head pose but also eye blinking are both important aspects for deep fake detection. The implicit control of poses by video has already achieved by the state-of-art work. According to recent research, eye blinking has weak correlation with input audio which means eye blinks extraction from audio and generation are possible. Hence, we propose a GAN-based architecture to extract eye blink feature from input audio and reference video respectively and employ contrastive training between them, then embed it into the concatenated features of identity and poses to generate talking face images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate photo-realistic talking face with synchronous lips motions, natural head poses and blinking eyes. "

To combat this issue, we revisit the complementary potential of LLMs and further elaborate it by mining latent expertise with off-the-shelf reward models. We propose Zooter, a reward-guided routing method distilling rewards on training queries to train a routing function, which can precisely distribute each query to the LLM with expertise about it. We also integrate a tag-based label enhancement to mitigate noise from uncertainty when using rewards as silver supervision. Zooter shows computation efficiency in inference as it introduces only a minor computation overhead of a routing function compared with reward model ranking methods. We evaluate Zooter on a comprehensive benchmark collection with 26 subsets on different domains and tasks. Zooter outperforms the best single model on average and ranks first on 44% of tasks, even surpassing multiple reward model ranking methods. "

To address this question, we examine the capacity of instruction-tuned LLMs to follow in-context concept guidelines for sentence labeling tasks. We design guidelines that present different types of factual and counterfactual concept definitions, which are used as prompts for zero-shot sentence classification tasks. Our results show that although concept definitions consistently help in task performance, only the larger models (with 70B parameters or more) have limited ability to work under counterfactual contexts. Importantly, only proprietary models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can recognize nonsensical guidelines, which we hypothesize is due to more sophisticated alignment methods. Finally, we find that Falcon-180B-chat is outperformed by Llama-2-70B-chat is most cases, which indicates that careful fine-tuning is more effective than increasing model scale. Altogether, our simple evaluation method reveals significant gaps in concept understanding between the most capable open-source language models and the leading proprietary APIs. "

        "abstract": "Instruction tuning has remarkably advanced large language models (LLMs) in understanding and responding to diverse human instructions. Despite the success in high-resource languages, its application in lower-resource ones faces challenges due to the imbalanced foundational abilities of LLMs across different languages, stemming from the uneven language distribution in their pre-training data. To tackle this issue, we propose pivot language guided generation (PLUG), an approach that utilizes a high-resource language, primarily English, as the pivot to enhance instruction tuning in lower-resource languages. It trains the model to first process instructions in the pivot language, and then produce responses in the target language. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark, X-AlpacaEval, of instructions in 4 languages (Chinese, Korean, Italian, and Spanish), each annotated by professional translators. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in the instruction-following abilities of LLMs by 29% on average, compared to directly responding in the target language alone. Further experiments validate the versatility of our approach by employing alternative pivot languages beyond English to assist languages where LLMs exhibit lower proficiency. "

        "abstract": "Uncertainty decomposition refers to the task of decomposing the total uncertainty of a model into data (aleatoric) uncertainty, resulting from the inherent complexity or ambiguity of the data, and model (epistemic) uncertainty, resulting from the lack of knowledge in the model. Performing uncertainty decomposition for large language models (LLMs) is an important step toward improving the reliability, trustworthiness, and interpretability of LLMs, but this research task is very challenging and remains unresolved. The existing canonical method, Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), cannot be applied to LLMs, because BNN requires training and ensembling multiple variants of models, which is infeasible or prohibitively expensive for LLMs. In this paper, we introduce an uncertainty decomposition framework for LLMs, called input clarifications ensemble, which bypasses the need to train new models. Rather than ensembling models with different parameters, our approach generates a set of clarifications for the input, feeds them into the fixed LLMs, and ensembles the corresponding predictions. We show that our framework shares a symmetric decomposition structure with BNN. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework provides accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification on various tasks.

        "abstract": "Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in long-term human-machine interactions, which basically relies on iterative recalling and reasoning of history to generate high-quality responses. However, such repeated recall-reason steps easily produce biased thoughts, \\textit{i.e.}, inconsistent reasoning results when recalling the same history for different questions. On the contrary, humans can keep thoughts in the memory and recall them without repeated reasoning. Motivated by this human capability, we propose a novel memory mechanism called TiM (Think-in-Memory) that enables LLMs to maintain an evolved memory for storing historical thoughts along the conversation stream. The TiM framework consists of two crucial stages: (1) before generating a response, a LLM agent recalls relevant thoughts from memory, and (2) after generating a response, the LLM agent post-thinks and incorporates both historical and new thoughts to update the memory. Thus, TiM can eliminate the issue of repeated reasoning by saving the post-thinking thoughts as the history. Besides, we formulate the basic principles to organize the thoughts in memory based on the well-established operations, (\\textit{i.e.}, insert, forget, and merge operations), allowing for dynamic updates and evolution of the thoughts. Furthermore, we introduce Locality-Sensitive Hashing into TiM to achieve efficient retrieval for the long-term conversations. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on real-world and simulated dialogues covering a wide range of topics, demonstrating that equipping existing LLMs with TiM significantly enhances their performance in generating responses for long-term interactions.

However, there are concerns that LLMs are possible to be used improperly or even illegally. To prevent the malicious usage of LLMs, detecting LLM-generated text becomes crucial in the deployment of LLM applications. Watermarking is an effective strategy to detect the LLM-generated content by encoding a pre-defined secret watermark to facilitate the detection process. However, the majority of existing watermark methods leverage the simple hashes of precedent tokens to partition vocabulary. Such watermark can be easily eliminated by paraphrase and correspondingly the detection effectiveness will be greatly compromised. Thus, to enhance the robustness against paraphrase, we propose a semantics-based watermark framework SemaMark. It leverages the semantics as an alternative to simple hashes of tokens since the paraphrase will likely preserve the semantic meaning of the sentences. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SemaMark under different paraphrases. "

ThoT systematically segments and analyzes extended contexts while adeptly selecting pertinent information. This strategy serves as a versatile \"plug-and-play\" module, seamlessly integrating with various LLMs and prompting techniques.

To better align with the intrinsic characteristics of implicit feedback data, we implement forward diffusion by applying synthetic smoothing filters to interaction signals on an item-item graph. The resulting reverse diffusion can be interpreted as a personalized process that gradually refines preference scores. Through graph Fourier transform, we equivalently characterize this model as an anisotropic Gaussian diffusion in the graph spectral domain, establishing both forward and reverse formulations. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on one dataset and yields competitive results on the others. "

The face de-identification technique is a practical way to solve the identity protection problem. The existing facial de-identification methods have revealed several problems, including the impact on the realism of anonymized results when faced with occlusions and the inability to maintain identity-irrelevant details in anonymized results. We present a High-Fidelity and Occlusion-Robust De-identification (HFORD) method to deal with these issues. This approach can disentangle identities and attributes while preserving image-specific details such as background, facial features (e.g., wrinkles), and lighting, even in occluded scenes. To disentangle the latent codes in the GAN inversion space, we introduce an Identity Disentanglement Module (IDM). This module selects the latent codes that are closely related to the identity. It further separates the latent codes into identity-related codes and attribute-related codes, enabling the network to preserve attributes while only modifying the identity. To ensure the preservation of image details and enhance the network's robustness to occlusions, we propose an Attribute Retention Module (ARM). This module adaptively preserves identity-irrelevant details and facial occlusions and blends them into the generated results in a modulated manner. Extensive experiments show that our method has higher quality, better detail fidelity, and stronger occlusion robustness than other face de-identification methods. "

In this paper, we introduce X-Eval, a two-stage instruction tuning framework to evaluate the text in both seen and unseen aspects customized by end users. X-Eval consists of two learning stages: the vanilla instruction tuning stage that improves the model's ability to follow evaluation instructions, and an enhanced instruction tuning stage that exploits the connections between fine-grained evaluation aspects to better assess text quality. To support the training of X-Eval, we collect AspectInstruct, the first instruction tuning dataset tailored for multi-aspect NLG evaluation spanning 27 diverse evaluation aspects with 65 tasks. To enhance task diversity, we devise an augmentation strategy that converts human rating annotations into diverse forms of NLG evaluation tasks, including scoring, comparison, ranking, and Boolean question answering. Extensive experiments across three essential categories of NLG tasks: dialogue generation, summarization, and data-to-text coupled with 21 aspects in meta-evaluation, demonstrate that our X-Eval enables even a lightweight language model to achieve a comparable if not higher correlation with human judgments compared to the state-of-the-art NLG evaluators, such as GPT-4.

However, previous works treat all video clips equally regardless of their semantic relevance with the text query in attention modules. In this paper, our goal is to provide clues for query-associated video clips within the crossmodal encoding process. With our Correlation-Guided Detection Transformer~(CG-DETR), we explore the appropriate clip-wise degree of cross-modal interactions and how to exploit such degrees for prediction. First, we design an adaptive cross-attention layer with dummy tokens. Dummy tokens conditioned by text query take a portion of the attention weights, preventing irrelevant video clips from being represented by the text query. Yet, not all word tokens equally inherit the text query's correlation to video clips. Thus, we further guide the cross-attention map by inferring the fine-grained correlation between video clips and words. We enable this by learning a joint embedding space for high-level concepts, i.e., moment and sentence level, and inferring the clip-word correlation. Lastly, we use a moment-adaptive saliency detector to exploit each video clip's degrees of text engagement. We validate the superiority of CG-DETR with the state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks for both moment retrieval and highlight detection.

Despite numerous studies into gender bias in translations from gender-neutral languages such as Turkish into more strongly gendered languages like English, there are no benchmarks for evaluating this phenomenon or for assessing mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce GATE X-E, an extension to the GATE (Rarrick et al., 2023) corpus, that consists of human translations from Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, and Persian into English. Each translation is accompanied by feminine, masculine, and neutral variants for each possible gender interpretation. The dataset, which contains between 1250 and 1850 instances for each of the four language pairs, features natural sentences with a wide range of sentence lengths and domains, challenging translation rewriters on various linguistic phenomena. Additionally, we present an English gender rewriting solution built on GPT-3.5 Turbo and use GATE X-E to evaluate it. We open source our contributions to encourage further research on gender debiasing. "

In our study, we evaluated the capabilities of 10 LLMs using 20 disinformation narratives. We evaluated several aspects of the LLMs: how well they are at generating news articles, how strongly they tend to agree or disagree with the disinformation narratives, how often they generate safety warnings, etc. We also evaluated the abilities of detection models to detect these articles as LLM-generated. We conclude that LLMs are able to generate convincing news articles that agree with dangerous disinformation narratives. "

However, the ability to control the output is limited. Here we present our novel method for latent vector shifting for controlled output image modification utilizing semantic features of the generated images. In our approach we use a pre-trained model of StyleGAN3 that generates images of realistic human faces in relatively high resolution. We complement the generative model with a convolutional neural network classifier, namely ResNet34, trained to classify the generated images with binary facial features from the CelebA dataset. Our latent feature shifter is a neural network model with a task to shift the latent vectors of a generative model into a specified feature direction. We have trained latent feature shifter for multiple facial features, and outperformed our baseline method in the number of generated images with the desired feature. To train our latent feature shifter neural network, we have designed a dataset of pairs of latent vectors with and without a certain feature. Based on the evaluation, we conclude that our latent feature shifter approach was successful in the controlled generation of the StyleGAN3 generator. "

        "abstract": "One-shot federated learning (OSFL) has gained attention in recent years due to its low communication cost. However, most of the existing methods require auxiliary datasets or training generators, which hinders their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we explore the novel opportunities that diffusion models bring to OSFL and propose FedCADO, utilizing guidance from client classifiers to generate data that complies with clients' distributions and subsequently training the aggregated model on the server. Specifically, our method involves targeted optimizations in two aspects. On one hand, we conditionally edit the randomly sampled initial noises, embedding them with specified semantics and distributions, resulting in a significant improvement in both the quality and stability of generation. On the other hand, we employ the BN statistics from the classifiers to provide detailed guidance during generation. These tailored optimizations enable us to limitlessly generate datasets, which closely resemble the distribution and quality of the original client dataset. Our method effectively handles the heterogeneous client models and the problems of non-IID features or labels. In terms of privacy protection, our method avoids training any generator or transferring any auxiliary information on clients, eliminating any additional privacy leakage risks. Leveraging the extensive knowledge stored in the pre-trained diffusion model, the synthetic datasets can assist us in surpassing the knowledge limitations of the client samples, resulting in aggregation models that even outperform the performance ceiling of centralized training in some cases, which is convincingly demonstrated in the sufficient quantification and visualization experiments conducted on three large-scale multi-domain image datasets.

The standard approach of estimating confidence is to use the softmax probabilities of these models, but as of November 2023, state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude-v1.3 do not provide access to these probabilities. We first study eliciting confidence linguistically -- asking an LLM for its confidence in its answer -- which performs reasonably (80.5% AUC on GPT-4 averaged across 12 question-answering datasets -- 7% above a random baseline) but leaves room for improvement. We then explore using a surrogate confidence model -- using a model where we do have probabilities to evaluate the original model's confidence in a given question. Surprisingly, even though these probabilities come from a different and often weaker model, this method leads to higher AUC than linguistic confidences on 9 out of 12 datasets. Our best method composing linguistic confidences and surrogate model probabilities gives state-of-the-art confidence estimates on all 12 datasets (84.6% average AUC on GPT-4). "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible performance in completing various real-world tasks. The current knowledge learning paradigm of LLMs is mainly based on learning from examples, in which LLMs learn the internal rule implicitly from a certain number of supervised examples. However, the learning paradigm may not well learn those complicated rules, especially when the training examples are limited. We are inspired that humans can learn the new tasks or knowledge in another way by learning from rules. That is, humans can grasp the new tasks or knowledge quickly and generalize well given only a detailed rule and a few optional examples. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of this new learning paradigm, which encodes the rule-based knowledge into LLMs. We propose rule distillation, which first uses the strong in-context abilities of LLMs to extract the knowledge from the textual rules and then explicitly encode the knowledge into LLMs' parameters by learning from the above in-context signals produced inside the model. Our experiments show that making LLMs learn from rules by our method is much more efficient than example-based learning in both the sample size and generalization ability. "

Moreover, the emergence of domain-specific LLMs has displayed extremely promising results on various tasks. In this study, we aim to quantify how general LLMs perform in comparison to legal-domain models (be it an LLM or otherwise). Specifically, we compare the zero-shot performance of three general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT-20b, LLaMA-2-70b, and Falcon-180b) on the LEDGAR subset of the LexGLUE benchmark for contract provision classification. Although the LLMs were not explicitly trained on legal data, we observe that they are still able to classify the theme correctly in most cases. However, we find that their mic-F1/mac-F1 performance is up to 19.2/26.8\\% lesser than smaller models fine-tuned on the legal domain, thus underscoring the need for more powerful legal-domain LLMs. "

Transfer learning for KBQA makes use of large volumes of unlabeled data in the target in addition to the labeled data in the source. More recently, few-shot in-context learning using Black-box Large Language Models (BLLMs) has been adapted for KBQA without considering any source domain data. In this work, we show how to meaningfully combine these two paradigms for KBQA so that their benefits add up. Specifically, we preserve the two stage retrieve-then-generate pipeline of supervised KBQA and introduce interaction between in-context learning using BLLMs and transfer learning from the source for both stages. In addition, we propose execution-guided self-refinement using BLLMs, decoupled from the transfer setting. With the help of experiments using benchmark datasets GrailQA as the source and WebQSP as the target, we show that the proposed combination brings significant improvements to both stages and also outperforms by a large margin state-of-the-art supervised KBQA models trained on the source. We also show that in the in-domain setting, the proposed BLLM augmentation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised models, when the volume of labeled data is limited, and also outperforms these marginally even when using the entire large training dataset.

To facilitate this, we propose a search strategy to construct reasoning labels for training the table reasoner. On both the FetaQA and QTSumm datasets, our approach achieved state-of-the-art results.

Existing encoder-decoder forensic networks overlook the fact that detecting complex and subtle tampered regions typically requires more feedback information. In this paper, we propose a Progressive FeedbACk-enhanced Transformer (ProFact) network to achieve coarse-to-fine image forgery localization. Specifically, the coarse localization map generated by an initial branch network is adaptively fed back to the early transformer encoder layers for enhancing the representation of positive features while suppressing interference factors. The cascaded transformer network, combined with a contextual spatial pyramid module, is designed to refine discriminative forensic features for improving the forgery localization accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, we present an effective strategy to automatically generate large-scale forged image samples close to real-world forensic scenarios, especially in realistic and coherent processing. Leveraging on such samples, a progressive and cost-effective two-stage training protocol is applied to the ProFact network. The extensive experimental results on nine public forensic datasets show that our proposed localizer greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the generalization ability and robustness of image forgery localization.

Existing research primarily focuses on traditional homogeneous networks, which cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous information networks (HINs). However, existing research also has some limitations. For instance, either they solely focus on single-type or multi-type community search, which severely lacking flexibility, or they require users to specify meta-paths or predefined community structures, which poses significant challenges for users who are unfamiliar with community search and HINs. In this paper, we propose an innovative method, FCS-HGNN, that can flexibly identify either single-type or multi-type communities in HINs based on user preferences. We propose the heterogeneous information transformer to handle node heterogeneity, and the edge-semantic attention mechanism to address edge heterogeneity. This not only considers the varying contributions of edges when identifying different communities, but also expertly circumvents the challenges presented by meta-paths, thereby elegantly unifying the single-type and multi-type community search problems. Moreover, to enhance the applicability on large-scale graphs, we propose the neighbor sampling and depth-based heuristic search strategies, resulting in LS-FCS-HGNN. This algorithm significantly improves training and query efficiency while maintaining outstanding community effectiveness. We conducted extensive experiments on five real-world large-scale HINs, and the results demonstrated that the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Finally, we conduct inference for the test query via in-context learning with the selected self-annotated demonstrations.

However, most of the contexts used are in practice very simple; in most cases, they are generated from short first-order logic sentences with only a few logical operators and quantifiers. In this work, we seek to answer the question how well a transformer-based model will perform reasoning over expressive contexts. For this purpose, we construct a synthetic natural language question-answering dataset, generated by description logic knowledge bases. For the generation of the knowledge bases, we use the expressive language $\\mathcal{ALCQ}$. The resulting dataset contains 384K examples, and increases in two dimensions: i) reasoning depth, and ii) length of sentences. We show that the performance of our DeBERTa-based model, DELTA$_M$, is marginally affected when the reasoning depth is increased and it is not affected at all when the length of the sentences is increasing. We also evaluate the generalization ability of the model on reasoning depths unseen at training, both increasing and decreasing, revealing interesting insights into the model's adaptive generalization abilities.

Motivated by the success of diffusion models, we propose a novel spectral diffusion prior for fusion-based HSI super-resolution. Specifically, we first investigate the spectrum generation problem and design a spectral diffusion model to model the spectral data distribution. Then, in the framework of maximum a posteriori, we keep the transition information between every two neighboring states during the reverse generative process, and thereby embed the knowledge of trained spectral diffusion model into the fusion problem in the form of a regularization term. At last, we treat each generation step of the final optimization problem as its subproblem, and employ the Adam to solve these subproblems in a reverse sequence. Experimental results conducted on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We proposed Speculative Contrastive Decoding (SCD), an accelerated decoding method leveraging the natural contrast between expert and amateur models in speculative decoding. Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that SCD can achieve similar acceleration factors as speculative decoding while further improving the generation quality as the contrastive decoding. The analysis of token probabilities further demonstrates the compatibility between speculative and contrastive decoding. Overall, SCD provides an effective approach to enhance the decoding quality of LLMs while saving computational resources. "

The performance of ICL on these tasks mostly cannot reach half of the state-of-the-art results. To explore the reasons behind this failure, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 18 specification-heavy tasks with various LLMs and identify three primary reasons: inability to specifically understand context, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate long-text understanding ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that through fine-tuning, LLMs can achieve decent performance on these tasks, indicating that the failure of ICL is not an inherent flaw of LLMs, but rather a drawback of existing alignment methods that renders LLMs incapable of handling complicated specification-heavy tasks via ICL. To substantiate this, we perform dedicated instruction tuning on LLMs for these tasks and observe a notable improvement. We hope the analyses in this paper could facilitate advancements in alignment methods enabling LLMs to meet more sophisticated human demands. "

We establish baselines of commonly used LLMs along with supervised models, and conduct cross-lingual transfer and multi-task learning experiments with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we analyze the weights of fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the possibility of identifying transfer difficulty between languages. Our results show that ChatGPT benefits much from in-context examples but still lags behind fine-tuned XLM-R, while the performance of GPT-4 is on par with fine-tuned XLM-R even in zero-shot setting. Cross-lingual and multi-task learning experiments show that unlike semantic tasks, in-language training data is crucial in acceptability judgements. Results in layerwise probing indicate that the upper layers of XLM-R become a task-specific but language-agnostic region for multilingual acceptability judgment.

        "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, either improving existing recommendation models or serving as the backbone. However, there exists a large semantic gap between LLMs and recommender systems, since items to be recommended are often indexed by discrete identifiers (item ID) out of the LLM's vocabulary. In essence, LLMs capture language semantics while recommender systems imply collaborative semantics, making it difficult to sufficiently leverage the model capacity of LLMs for recommendation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new LLM-based recommendation model called LC-Rec, which can better integrate language and collaborative semantics for recommender systems. Our approach can directly generate items from the entire item set for recommendation, without relying on candidate items. Specifically, we make two major contributions in our approach. For item indexing, we design a learning-based vector quantization method with uniform semantic mapping, which can assign meaningful and non-conflicting IDs (called item indices) for items. For alignment tuning, we propose a series of specially designed tuning tasks to enhance the integration of collaborative semantics in LLMs. Our fine-tuning tasks enforce LLMs to deeply integrate language and collaborative semantics (characterized by the learned item indices), so as to achieve an effective adaptation to recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that our approach can outperform a number of competitive baselines including traditional recommenders and existing LLM-based recommenders.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09050",
        "abstract": "Zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a prominent vision-language task that examines both the visual and textual understanding capability of systems in the absence of training data. Recently, by converting the images into captions, information across multi-modalities is bridged and Large Language Models (LLMs) can apply their strong zero-shot generalization capability to unseen questions. To design ideal prompts for solving VQA via LLMs, several studies have explored different strategies to select or generate question-answer pairs as the exemplar prompts, which guide LLMs to answer the current questions effectively. However, they totally ignore the role of question prompts. The original questions in VQA tasks usually encounter ellipses and ambiguity which require intermediate reasoning. To this end, we present Reasoning Question Prompts for VQA tasks, which can further activate the potential of LLMs in zero-shot scenarios. Specifically, for each question, we first generate self-contained questions as reasoning question prompts via an unsupervised question edition module considering sentence fluency, semantic integrity and syntactic invariance. Each reasoning question prompt clearly indicates the intent of the original question. This results in a set of candidate answers. Then, the candidate answers associated with their confidence scores acting as answer heuristics are fed into LLMs and produce the final answer. We evaluate reasoning question prompts on three VQA challenges, experimental results demonstrate that they can significantly improve the results of LLMs on zero-shot setting and outperform existing state-of-the-art zero-shot methods on three out of four data sets.

However, existing knowledge editing methods are entity-centric, and it is unclear whether this approach is suitable for a relation-centric perspective. To address this gap, this paper constructs a new benchmark named RaKE, which focuses on Relation based Knowledge Editing. In this paper, we establish a suite of innovative metrics for evaluation and conduct comprehensive experiments involving various knowledge editing baselines. We notice that existing knowledge editing methods exhibit the potential difficulty in their ability to edit relations. Therefore, we further explore the role of relations in factual triplets within the transformer. Our research results confirm that knowledge related to relations is not only stored in the FFN network but also in the attention layers. This provides experimental support for future relation-based knowledge editing methods. "

This paper studies if we can locate a small set of neurons in LLMs responsible for memorizing a given sequence. While the concept of localization is often mentioned in prior work, methods for localization have never been systematically and directly evaluated; we address this with two benchmarking approaches. In our INJ Benchmark, we actively inject a piece of new information into a small subset of LLM weights and measure whether localization methods can identify these \"ground truth\" weights. In the DEL Benchmark, we study localization of pretrained data that LLMs have already memorized; while this setting lacks ground truth, we can still evaluate localization by measuring whether dropping out located neurons erases a memorized sequence from the model. We evaluate five localization methods on our two benchmarks, and both show similar rankings. All methods exhibit promising localization ability, especially for pruning-based methods, though the neurons they identify are not necessarily specific to a single memorized sequence. "

        "abstract": "Reliance on the inherent knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) can cause issues such as hallucinations, lack of control, and difficulties in integrating variable knowledge. To mitigate this, LLMs can be probed to generate responses by grounding on external context, often given as input (knowledge-augmented models). Yet, previous research is often confined to a narrow view of the term \"grounding\", often only focusing on whether the response contains the correct answer or not, which does not ensure the reliability of the entire response. To address this limitation, we introduce a strict definition of grounding: a model is considered truly grounded when its responses (1) fully utilize necessary knowledge from the provided context, and (2) don't exceed the knowledge within the contexts. We introduce a new dataset and a grounding metric to assess this new definition and perform experiments across 13 LLMs of different sizes and training methods to provide insights into the factors that influence grounding performance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how to improve grounding capabilities and suggest an area of improvement toward more reliable and controllable LLM applications. "

MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neuron and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry, Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our results achieve SOTA performance. Our code and data will be released to the public. "

        "abstract": "Given a descriptive text query, text-based person search (TBPS) aims to retrieve the best-matched target person from an image gallery. Such a cross-modal retrieval task is quite challenging due to significant modality gap, fine-grained differences and insufficiency of annotated data. To better align the two modalities, most existing works focus on introducing sophisticated network structures and auxiliary tasks, which are complex and hard to implement. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective dual Transformer model for text-based person search. By exploiting a hardness-aware contrastive learning strategy, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance without any special design for local feature alignment or side information. Moreover, we propose a proximity data generation (PDG) module to automatically produce more diverse data for cross-modal training. The PDG module first introduces an automatic generation algorithm based on a text-to-image diffusion model, which generates new text-image pair samples in the proximity space of original ones. Then it combines approximate text generation and feature-level mixup during training to further strengthen the data diversity. The PDG module can largely guarantee the reasonability of the generated samples that are directly used for training without any human inspection for noise rejection. It improves the performance of our model significantly, providing a feasible solution to the data insufficiency problem faced by such fine-grained visual-linguistic tasks. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets of the TBPS task (i.e., CUHK-PEDES and ICFG-PEDES) show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches evidently, e.g., improving by 3.88%, 4.02%, 2.92% in terms of Top1, Top5, Top10 on CUHK-PEDES.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their capabilities, yet this progress is accompanied by a growing array of safety risks. While significant attention has been dedicated to exploiting weaknesses in LLMs through jailbreaking attacks, there remains a paucity of exploration into defending against these attacks. We point out a pivotal factor contributing to the success of jailbreaks: the inherent conflict between the goals of being helpful and ensuring safety. To counter jailbreaking attacks, we propose to integrate goal prioritization at both training and inference stages. Implementing goal prioritization during inference substantially diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreaking attacks, reducing it from 66.4% to 2.0% for ChatGPT and from 68.2% to 19.4% for Vicuna-33B, without compromising general performance. Furthermore, integrating the concept of goal prioritization into the training phase reduces the ASR from 71.0% to 6.6% for LLama2-13B. Remarkably, even in scenarios where no jailbreaking samples are included during training, our approach slashes the ASR by half, decreasing it from 71.0% to 34.0%. Additionally, our findings reveal that while stronger LLMs face greater safety risks, they also possess a greater capacity to be steered towards defending against such attacks. We hope our work could contribute to the comprehension of jailbreaking attacks and defenses, and shed light on the relationship between LLMs' capability and safety.

        "abstract": "Human perception and understanding is a major domain of computer vision which, like many other vision subdomains recently, stands to gain from the use of large models pre-trained on large datasets. We hypothesize that the most common pre-training strategy of relying on general purpose, object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet, is limited by an important domain shift. On the other hand, collecting domain specific ground truth such as 2D or 3D labels does not scale well. Therefore, we propose a pre-training approach based on self-supervised learning that works on human-centric data using only images. Our method uses pairs of images of humans: the first is partially masked and the model is trained to reconstruct the masked parts given the visible ones and a second image. It relies on both stereoscopic (cross-view) pairs, and temporal (cross-pose) pairs taken from videos, in order to learn priors about 3D as well as human motion. We pre-train a model for body-centric tasks and one for hand-centric tasks. With a generic transformer architecture, these models outperform existing self-supervised pre-training methods on a wide set of human-centric downstream tasks, and obtain state-of-the-art performance for instance when fine-tuning for model-based and model-free human mesh recovery.

In this paper, we introduce MAVEN-Arg, which augments MAVEN datasets with event argument annotations, making the first all-in-one dataset supporting event detection, event argument extraction (EAE), and event relation extraction. As an EAE benchmark, MAVEN-Arg offers three main advantages: (1) a comprehensive schema covering 162 event types and 612 argument roles, all with expert-written definitions and examples; (2) a large data scale, containing 98,591 events and 290,613 arguments obtained with laborious human annotation; (3) the exhaustive annotation supporting all task variants of EAE, which annotates both entity and non-entity event arguments in document level. Experiments indicate that MAVEN-Arg is quite challenging for both fine-tuned EAE models and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of an all-in-one dataset, we preliminarily explore a potential application, future event prediction, with LLMs. MAVEN-Arg and our code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/MAVEN-Argument.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called Real-time Verification and Rectification (Ever). Instead of waiting until the end of the generation process to rectify hallucinations, Ever employs a real-time, step-wise generation and hallucination rectification strategy. The primary objective is to detect and rectify hallucinations as they occur during the text generation process. When compared to both retrieval-based and non-retrieval-based baselines, Ever demonstrates a significant improvement in generating trustworthy and factually accurate text across a diverse range of tasks, including short-form QA, biography generation, and multi-hop reasoning.

Up to now, the scheme required training a distinct binary classifier for each possible splitting of the grid into two sides, resulting in a computational cost that scales linearly with the number of grid points. In this work, we propose and showcase an alternative implementation that only requires the training of a single multi-class classifier. Ideally, such multi-task learning eliminates the scaling with respect to the number of grid points.

        "abstract": "Recent research has shown that transformer networks can be used as differentiable search indexes by representing each document as a sequences of document ID tokens. These generative retrieval models cast the retrieval problem to a document ID generation problem for each given query. Despite their elegant design, existing generative retrieval models only perform well on artificially-constructed and small-scale collections. This has led to serious skepticism in the research community on their real-world impact. This paper represents an important milestone in generative retrieval research by showing, for the first time, that generative retrieval models can be trained to perform effectively on large-scale standard retrieval benchmarks. For doing so, we propose RIPOR- an optimization framework for generative retrieval that can be adopted by any encoder-decoder architecture. RIPOR is designed based on two often-overlooked fundamental design considerations in generative retrieval. First, given the sequential decoding nature of document ID generation, assigning accurate relevance scores to documents based on the whole document ID sequence is not sufficient. To address this issue, RIPOR introduces a novel prefix-oriented ranking optimization algorithm. Second, initial document IDs should be constructed based on relevance associations between queries and documents, instead of the syntactic and semantic information in the documents. RIPOR addresses this issue using a relevance-based document ID construction approach that quantizes relevance-based representations learned for documents. Evaluation on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track reveals that RIPOR surpasses state-of-the-art generative retrieval models by a large margin (e.g., 30.5% MRR improvements on MS MARCO Dev Set), and perform better on par with popular dense retrieval models.

A context window can include task specifications, retrieved documents, previous conversations, and even model self-reflections, functioning similarly to episodic memory. While efforts are being made to expand the context window, studies indicate that LLMs do not use their context optimally for response generation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to optimize LLMs using ranking metrics, which teaches LLMs to rank a collection of contextually-grounded candidate responses. Rather than a traditional full ordering, we advocate for a partial ordering. This is because achieving consensus on the perfect order for system responses can be challenging. Our partial ordering is more robust, less sensitive to noise, and can be acquired through human labelers, heuristic functions, or model distillation. We test our system's improved contextual understanding using the latest benchmarks, including a new multi-document question answering dataset. We conduct ablation studies to understand crucial factors, such as how to gather candidate responses, determine their most suitable order, and balance supervised fine-tuning with ranking metrics. Our approach, named RRescue, suggests a promising avenue for enhancing LLMs' contextual understanding via response ranking. "

Speakers and listeners work together to both identify and construct a shared basis while avoiding misunderstanding. To accomplish grounding, humans rely on a range of dialogue acts, like clarification (What do you mean?) and acknowledgment (I understand.). In domains like teaching and emotional support, carefully constructing grounding prevents misunderstanding. However, it is unclear whether large language models (LLMs) leverage these dialogue acts in constructing common ground. To this end, we curate a set of grounding acts and propose corresponding metrics that quantify attempted grounding. We study whether LLMs use these grounding acts, simulating them taking turns from several dialogue datasets, and comparing the results to humans. We find that current LLMs are presumptive grounders, biased towards assuming common ground without using grounding acts. To understand the roots of this behavior, we examine the role of instruction tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), finding that RLHF leads to less grounding. Altogether, our work highlights the need for more research investigating grounding in human-AI interaction. "

However, genuinely assessing the capabilities of these LLMs has become a challenging and critical issue due to potential data contamination, and it wastes dozens of time and effort for researchers and engineers to download and try those contaminated models. To save our precious time, we propose a novel and useful method, Clean-Eval, which mitigates the issue of data contamination and evaluates the LLMs in a cleaner manner. Clean-Eval employs an LLM to paraphrase and back-translate the contaminated data into a candidate set, generating expressions with the same meaning but in different surface forms. A semantic detector is then used to filter the generated low-quality samples to narrow down this candidate set. The best candidate is finally selected from this set based on the BLEURT score. According to human assessment, this best candidate is semantically similar to the original contamination data but expressed differently. All candidates can form a new benchmark to evaluate the model. Our experiments illustrate that Clean-Eval substantially restores the actual evaluation results on contaminated LLMs under both few-shot learning and fine-tuning scenarios. "

        "abstract": "Cognitive research indicates that abstraction ability is essential in human intelligence, which remains under-explored in language models. In this paper, we present AbsPyramid, a unified entailment graph of 221K textual descriptions of abstraction knowledge. While existing resources only touch nouns or verbs within simplified events or specific domains, AbsPyramid collects abstract knowledge for three components of diverse events to comprehensively evaluate the abstraction ability of language models in the open domain. Experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs face challenges comprehending abstraction knowledge in zero-shot and few-shot settings. By training on our rich abstraction knowledge, we find LLMs can acquire basic abstraction abilities and generalize to unseen events. In the meantime, we empirically show that our benchmark is comprehensive to enhance LLMs across two previous abstraction tasks. "

RBPGAN integrates two state-of-the-art models to get the best in both worlds without compromising the accuracy of produced video. The generator of the model is inspired by RBPN system, while the discriminator is inspired by TecoGAN. We also utilize Ping-Pong loss to increase temporal consistency over time.

        "abstract": "Powerful large language models have facilitated the development of writing assistants that promise to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of composition and communication. However, a barrier to effective assistance is the lack of personalization in LLM outputs to the author's communication style and specialized knowledge. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing PEARL, a retrieval-augmented LLM writing assistant personalized with a generation-calibrated retriever. Our retriever is trained to select historic user-authored documents for prompt augmentation, such that they are likely to best personalize LLM generations for a user request. We propose two key novelties for training our retriever: 1) A training data selection method that identifies user requests likely to benefit from personalization and documents that provide that benefit; and 2) A scale-calibrating KL-divergence objective that ensures that our retriever closely tracks the benefit of a document for personalized generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PEARL in generating personalized workplace social media posts and Reddit comments. Finally, we showcase the potential of a generation-calibrated retriever to double as a performance predictor and further improve low-quality generations via LLM chaining. "

In this work, we introduce ContraDoc, the first human-annotated dataset to study self-contradictions in long documents across multiple domains, varying document lengths, self-contradictions types, and scope. We then analyze the current capabilities of four state-of-the-art open-source and commercially available LLMs: GPT3.5, GPT4, PaLM2, and LLaMAv2 on this dataset. While GPT4 performs the best and can outperform humans on this task, we find that it is still unreliable and struggles with self-contradictions that require more nuance and context.

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) already achieve strong performance on standard generic summarization benchmarks, their performance on more complex summarization task settings is less studied. Therefore, we benchmark LLMs on instruction controllable text summarization, where the model input consists of both a source article and a natural language requirement for the desired summary characteristics. To this end, we curate an evaluation-only dataset for this task setting and conduct human evaluation on 5 LLM-based summarization systems. We then benchmark LLM-based automatic evaluation for this task with 4 different evaluation protocols and 11 LLMs, resulting in 40 evaluation methods in total. Our study reveals that instruction controllable text summarization remains a challenging task for LLMs, since (1) all LLMs evaluated still make factual and other types of errors in their summaries; (2) all LLM-based evaluation methods cannot achieve a strong alignment with human annotators when judging the quality of candidate summaries; (3) different LLMs show large performance gaps in summary generation and evaluation. We make our collected benchmark, InstruSum, publicly available to facilitate future research in this direction. "

However they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, and thus their outputs generally require manual human verification for high-stakes applications, which can be time-consuming and difficult. This paper proposes symbolically grounded generation (SymGen) as a simple approach for enabling easier validation of an LLM's output. SymGen prompts an LLM to interleave its regular output text with explicit symbolic references to fields present in some conditioning data (e.g., a table in JSON format). The references can be used to display the provenance of different spans of text in the generation, reducing the effort required for manual verification. Across data-to-text and question answering experiments, we find that LLMs are able to directly output text that makes use of symbolic references while maintaining fluency and accuracy. "

This benchmark encompasses a total of six sub-tasks, covering three dimensions, to systematically assess the capabilities of LLMs in the realm of mental health. We have designed corresponding concise prompts for each sub-task. And we comprehensively evaluate a total of eight advanced LLMs using our benchmark. Experiment results not only demonstrate significant room for improvement in current LLMs concerning mental health but also unveil potential directions for future model optimization. "

        "abstract": "Large vision-language representation learning models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive performance for zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks while largely benefiting from inter-modal (image-text) alignment via contrastive objectives. This downstream performance can further be enhanced by full-scale fine-tuning which is often compute intensive, requires large labelled data, and can reduce out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Furthermore, sole reliance on inter-modal alignment might overlook the rich information embedded within each individual modality. In this work, we introduce a sample-efficient domain adaptation strategy for CLIP, termed Domain Aligned CLIP (DAC), which improves both intra-modal (image-image) and inter-modal alignment on target distributions without fine-tuning the main model. For intra-modal alignment, we introduce a lightweight adapter that is specifically trained with an intra-modal contrastive objective. To improve inter-modal alignment, we introduce a simple framework to modulate the precomputed class text embeddings. The proposed few-shot fine-tuning framework is computationally efficient, robust to distribution shifts, and does not alter CLIP's parameters. We study the effectiveness of DAC by benchmarking on 11 widely used image classification tasks with consistent improvements in 16-shot classification upon strong baselines by about 2.3% and demonstrate competitive performance on 4 OOD robustness benchmarks.

To overcome this crucial issue, this paper proposes to enhance the information searching and reflection ability of LLMs in long contexts via specially designed tasks called Attention Strengthening Multi-doc QA (ASM QA). Following these tasks, our model excels in focusing more precisely on the desired information. Experimental results show substantial improvement in Multi-doc QA and other benchmarks, superior to state-of-the-art models by 13.7% absolute gain in shuffled settings, by 21.5% in passage retrieval task.

This gives Fusion-Eval flexibility, enabling it to work effectively across diverse tasks and make optimal use of multiple references. In testing on the SummEval dataset, Fusion-Eval achieved a Spearman correlation of 0.96, outperforming other evaluators.

Current methods often require pretraining on tables or special model architecture design, are restricted to specific table types, or have simplifying assumptions about tables and tasks. This paper makes the first step towards developing open-source large language models (LLMs) as generalists for a diversity of table-based tasks. Towards that end, we construct TableInstruct, a new dataset with a variety of realistic tables and tasks, for instruction tuning and evaluating LLMs. We further develop the first open-source generalist model for tables, TableLlama, by fine-tuning Llama 2 (7B) with LongLoRA to address the long context challenge. We experiment under both in-domain setting and out-of-domain setting. On 7 out of 8 in-domain tasks, TableLlama achieves comparable or better performance than the SOTA for each task, despite the latter often has task-specific design. On 6 out-of-domain datasets, it achieves 6-48 absolute point gains compared with the base model, showing that training on TableInstruct enhances the model's generalizability. We will open-source our dataset and trained model to boost future work on developing open generalist models for tables. "

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) represent a substantial advancement in the capabilities of large language models, notably in reducing factual hallucination by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed. The retrieval of irrelevant data can lead to misguided responses, and potentially causing the model to overlook its inherent knowledge, even when it possesses adequate information to address the query. Moreover, standard RALMs often struggle to assess whether they possess adequate knowledge, both intrinsic and retrieved, to provide an accurate answer. In situations where knowledge is lacking, these systems should ideally respond with \"unknown\" when the answer is unattainable. In response to these challenges, we introduces Chain-of-Noting (CoN), a novel approach aimed at improving the robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios. The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question and integrating this information to formulate the final answer. We employed ChatGPT to create training data for CoN, which was subsequently trained on an LLaMa-2 7B model. Our experiments across four open-domain QA benchmarks show that RALMs equipped with CoN significantly outperform standard RALMs. Notably, CoN achieves an average improvement of +7.9 in EM score given entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions that fall outside the pre-training knowledge scope.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in the field of natural language processing. However, the sheer scale and computational demands of these models present formidable challenges when considering their practical deployment in resource-constrained contexts. While techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation have displayed promise in distilling LLMs into small language models (SLMs), there is a risk that distilled SLMs may still carry over flawed reasoning or hallucinations inherited from their LLM counterparts. To address these issues, we propose a twofold methodology: First, we introduce a novel method for distilling the self-evaluation capability inherent in LLMs into SLMs, which aims to mitigate the adverse effects of erroneous reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Second, we advocate for a comprehensive distillation process that incorporates multiple distinct chain-of-thought and self-evaluation paradigms and ensures a more holistic and robust knowledge transfer into SLMs. Experiments on three NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of distilled SLMs and sheds light on the path towards developing smaller models closely aligned with human cognition.

In this work, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of model behaviors beyond ImageNet accuracy, for both ConvNet and Vision Transformer architectures, each across supervised and CLIP training paradigms. Although our selected models have similar ImageNet accuracies and compute requirements, we find that they differ in many other aspects: types of mistakes, output calibration, transferability, and feature invariance, among others.

While recent 3D generative models show promise of 3D consistent human digitization, these approaches do not generalize well to diverse clothing appearances, and the results lack photorealism. Unlike existing work, we utilize high-capacity 2D diffusion models pretrained for general image synthesis tasks as an appearance prior of clothed humans. To achieve better 3D consistency while retaining the input identity, we progressively synthesize multiple views of the human in the input image by inpainting missing regions with shape-guided diffusion conditioned on silhouette and surface normal. We then fuse these synthesized multi-view images via inverse rendering to obtain a fully textured high-resolution 3D mesh of the given person. Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods and achieves photorealistic 360-degree synthesis of a wide range of clothed humans with complex textures from a single image. "
