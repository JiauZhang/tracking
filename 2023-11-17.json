        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09230",
        "abstract": "The adoption of generative AI technologies is swiftly expanding. Services employing both linguistic and mul-timodal models are evolving, offering users increasingly precise responses. Consequently, human reliance on these technologies is expected to grow rapidly. With the premise that people will be impacted by the output of AI, we explored approaches to help AI output produce better results. Initially, we evaluated how contemporary AI services competitively meet user needs, then examined society's depiction as mirrored by Large Language Models (LLMs). We did a query experiment, querying about social conventions in various countries and eliciting a one-word response. We compared the LLMs' value judgments with public data and suggested an model of decision-making in value-conflicting scenarios which could be adopted for future machine value judgments. This paper advocates for a practical approach to using AI as a tool for investigating other remote worlds. This re-search has significance in implicitly rejecting the notion of AI making value judgments and instead arguing a more critical perspective on the environment that defers judgmental capabilities to individuals. We anticipate this study will empower anyone, regardless of their capacity, to receive safe and accurate value judgment-based out-puts effectively. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09235",
        "abstract": "Generative models trained on internet-scale data are capable of generating novel and realistic texts, images, and videos. A natural next question is whether these models can advance science, for example by generating novel stable materials. Traditionally, models with explicit structures (e.g., graphs) have been used in modeling structural relationships in scientific data (e.g., atoms and bonds in crystals), but generating structures can be difficult to scale to large and complex systems. Another challenge in generating materials is the mismatch between standard generative modeling metrics and downstream applications. For instance, common metrics such as the reconstruction error do not correlate well with the downstream goal of discovering stable materials. In this work, we tackle the scalability challenge by developing a unified crystal representation that can represent any crystal structure (UniMat), followed by training a diffusion probabilistic model on these UniMat representations. Our empirical results suggest that despite the lack of explicit structure modeling, UniMat can generate high fidelity crystal structures from larger and more complex chemical systems, outperforming previous graph-based approaches under various generative modeling metrics. To better connect the generation quality of materials to downstream applications, such as discovering novel stable materials, we propose additional metrics for evaluating generative models of materials, including per-composition formation energy and stability with respect to convex hulls through decomposition energy from Density Function Theory (DFT). Lastly, we show that conditional generation with UniMat can scale to previously established crystal datasets with up to millions of crystals structures, outperforming random structure search (the current leading method for structure discovery) in discovering new stable materials.

        "abstract": "The human brain is naturally equipped to comprehend and interpret visual information rapidly. When confronted with complex problems or concepts, we use flowcharts, sketches, and diagrams to aid our thought process. Leveraging this inherent ability can significantly enhance logical reasoning. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) do not utilize such visual intuition to help their thinking. Even the most advanced version language models (e.g., GPT-4V and LLaVA) merely align images into textual space, which means their reasoning processes remain purely verbal. To mitigate such limitations, we present a Chain of Images (CoI) approach, which can convert complex language reasoning problems to simple pattern recognition by generating a series of images as intermediate representations. Furthermore, we have developed a CoI evaluation dataset encompassing 15 distinct domains where images can intuitively aid problem-solving. Based on this dataset, we aim to construct a benchmark to assess the capability of future multimodal large-scale models to leverage images for reasoning. In supporting our CoI reasoning, we introduce a symbolic multimodal large language model (SyMLLM) that generates images strictly based on language instructions and accepts both text and image as input. Experiments on Geometry, Chess and Common Sense tasks sourced from the CoI evaluation dataset show that CoI improves performance significantly over the pure-language Chain of Thoughts (CoT) baselines.

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing, LLMs present a novel opportunity to augment traditional psychological counseling methods. This research primarily focuses on evaluating the LLM's ability to engage in empathetic, adaptable, and contextually appropriate interactions within a therapeutic setting. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted by a panel of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists using a specially developed scorecard. The assessment covered various aspects of the LLM's performance, including empathy, communication skills, adaptability, engagement, and the ability to establish a therapeutic alliance. The study avoided direct testing with patients, prioritizing privacy and ethical considerations, and instead relied on simulated scenarios to gauge the LLM's effectiveness. The results indicate that LLMs hold significant promise as supportive tools in therapy, demonstrating strengths in empathetic engagement and adaptability in conversation. However, challenges in achieving the depth of personalization and emotional understanding characteristic of human therapists were noted. The study also highlights the importance of ethical considerations in the application of AI in therapeutic contexts. This research provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of using LLMs in psychological counseling for autistic adolescents. It lays the groundwork for future explorations into AI's role in mental health care, emphasizing the need for ongoing development to enhance the capabilities of these models in therapeutic settings.

        "abstract": "The potential impact of an academic paper is determined by various factors, including its popularity and contribution. Existing models usually estimate original citation counts based on static graphs and fail to differentiate values from nuanced perspectives. In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network to Disentangle the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution values (called DPPDCC). Given a target paper, DPPDCC encodes temporal and structural features within the constructed dynamic heterogeneous graph. Particularly, to capture the knowledge flow, we emphasize the importance of comparative and co-cited/citing information between papers and aggregate snapshots evolutionarily. To unravel popularity, we contrast augmented graphs to extract the essence of diffusion and predict the accumulated citation binning to model conformity. We further apply orthogonal constraints to encourage distinct modeling of each perspective and preserve the inherent value of contribution. To evaluate models' generalization for papers published at various times, we reformulate the problem by partitioning data based on specific time points to mirror real-world conditions. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that DPPDCC significantly outperforms baselines for previously, freshly, and immediately published papers. Further analyses confirm its robust capabilities. We will make our datasets and codes publicly available. "

Vanilla In-Context Learning relies on human-provided contexts, such as labeled examples, explicit instructions, or other guiding mechanisms that shape the model's outputs. To address this challenge, our study presents a universal framework named Automatic In-Context Learning. Upon receiving a user's request, we ask the model to independently generate examples, including labels, instructions, or reasoning pathways. The model then leverages this self-produced context to tackle the given problem. Our approach is universally adaptable and can be implemented in any setting where vanilla In-Context Learning is applicable. We demonstrate that our method yields strong performance across a range of tasks, standing up well when compared to existing methods. "

However, these impressive image processing approaches face consistency issues in video processing. In this paper, we propose a powerful model-free toolkit called FastBlend to address the consistency problem for video processing. Based on a patch matching algorithm, we design two inference modes, including blending and interpolation. In the blending mode, FastBlend eliminates video flicker by blending the frames within a sliding window. Moreover, we optimize both computational efficiency and video quality according to different application scenarios. In the interpolation mode, given one or more keyframes rendered by diffusion models, FastBlend can render the whole video. Since FastBlend does not modify the generation process of diffusion models, it exhibits excellent compatibility. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of FastBlend. In the blending mode, FastBlend outperforms existing methods for video deflickering and video synthesis. In the interpolation mode, FastBlend surpasses video interpolation and model-based video processing approaches. The source codes have been released on GitHub. "

In this work, we tackle these challenges from both a data and framework perspective and introduce Symbol-LLM series models. First, we collect 34 symbolic tasks, covering ~20 different forms, which are unified to capture symbol interrelations. Then, a two-stage tuning framework succeeds in injecting symbolic knowledge without loss of the generality ability. Extensive experiments on both symbol- and NL-centric tasks demonstrate the balanced and superior performances of Symbol-LLM series models. "

In general, these studies have implicitly assumed that the probability scores from LLMs are accurate, ignoring the discrepancies between human cognition and LLMs from this standpoint. Inspired by the concept of probability calibration, we are the first work to focus on the probability distribution for human reading simulation. We propose to use temperature-scaled surprisal, a surprisal calculated by shaped probability, to be the predictor of human reading times. Our results across three corpora consistently revealed that such a surprisal can drastically improve the prediction of reading times. Setting the temperature to be approximately 2.5 across all models and datasets can yield up to an 89% of increase in delta log-likelihood in our setting. We also propose a calibration metric to quantify the possible human-likeness bias. Further analysis was done and provided insights into this phenomenon. "

        "abstract": "Despite their remarkable performance on abstractive summarization, large language models (LLMs) face two significant challenges: their considerable size and tendency to hallucinate. Hallucinations are concerning because they erode the reliability of LLMs and raise safety issues. Pruning is a technique that reduces model size by removing redundant weights to create sparse models that enable more efficient inference. Pruned models yield comparable performance to their counterpart full-sized models, making them ideal alternatives when operating on a limited budget. However, the effect that pruning has upon hallucinations in abstractive summarization with LLMs has yet to be explored. In this paper, we provide an extensive empirical study on the hallucinations produced by pruned models across three standard summarization tasks, two pruning approaches, three instruction-tuned LLMs, and three hallucination evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we find that pruned LLMs hallucinate less compared to their full-sized counterparts. Our follow-up analysis suggests that pruned models tend to depend more on the source input and less on their parametric knowledge from pre-training for generation. This greater dependency on the source input leads to a higher lexical overlap between generated content and the source input, which can be a reason for the reduction in hallucinations. "

In this paper, we propose to improve zero-shot cross-lingual transfer by composing language or task specialized parameters. Our method composes language and task PEFT modules via element-wise arithmetic operations to leverage unlabeled data and English labeled data. We extend our approach to cases where labeled data from more languages is available and propose to arithmetically compose PEFT modules trained on languages related to the target. Empirical results on summarization demonstrate that our method is an effective strategy that obtains consistent gains using minimal training of PEFT modules. "

        "abstract": "Diffusion models are at the vanguard of generative AI research with renowned solutions such as ImageGen by Google Brain and DALL.E 3 by OpenAI. Nevertheless, the potential merits of diffusion models for communication engineering applications are not fully understood yet. In this paper, we aim to unleash the power of generative AI for PHY design of constellation symbols in communication systems. Although the geometry of constellations is predetermined according to networking standards, e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), probabilistic shaping can design the probability of occurrence (generation) of constellation symbols. This can help improve the information rate and decoding performance of communication systems. We exploit the ``denoise-and-generate'' characteristics of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) for probabilistic constellation shaping. The key idea is to learn generating constellation symbols out of noise, ``mimicking'' the way the receiver performs symbol reconstruction. This way, we make the constellation symbols sent by the transmitter, and what is inferred (reconstructed) at the receiver become as similar as possible, resulting in as few mismatches as possible. Our results show that the generative AI-based scheme outperforms deep neural network (DNN)-based benchmark and uniform shaping, while providing network resilience as well as robust out-of-distribution performance under low-SNR regimes and non-Gaussian assumptions. Numerical evaluations highlight 30% improvement in terms of cosine similarity and a threefold improvement in terms of mutual information compared to DNN-based approach for 64-QAM geometry. "

Our methodology involves observing the output of a stable diffusion model at different generative epochs and training a classification model to distinguish when a series of intermediates originated from a training sample or not. We propose numerous ways to measure the membership features and discuss what works best. The attack's efficacy is assessed using the ROC AUC method, demonstrating a 60\\% success rate in inferring membership information. This paper contributes to the growing body of research on privacy and security in machine learning, highlighting the need for robust defenses against MIAs.

However, LLMs still exhibit limitations, including the generation of factually incorrect information. In safety-critical applications, it is important to assess the confidence of LLM-generated content to make informed decisions. Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) is relatively a new area of research in NLP. RALMs offer potential benefits for scientific NLP tasks, as retrieved documents, can serve as evidence to support model-generated content. This inclusion of evidence enhances trustworthiness, as users can verify and explore the retrieved documents to validate model outputs. Quantifying uncertainty in RALM generations further improves trustworthiness, with retrieved text and confidence scores contributing to a comprehensive and reliable model for scientific applications. However, there is limited to no research on UQ for RALMs, particularly in scientific contexts. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of UQ in RALMs, focusing on scientific tasks. This research investigates how uncertainty scores vary when scientific knowledge is incorporated as pretraining and retrieval data and explores the relationship between uncertainty scores and the accuracy of model-generated outputs. We observe that an existing RALM finetuned with scientific knowledge as the retrieval data tends to be more confident in generating predictions compared to the model pretrained only with scientific knowledge. We also found that RALMs are overconfident in their predictions, making inaccurate predictions more confidently than accurate ones. Scientific knowledge provided either as pretraining or retrieval corpus does not help alleviate this issue. We released our code, data and dashboards at https://github.com/pnnl/EXPERT2. "

We investigate the use of GPT models and prompt engineering for knowledge graph construction with the Wikidata knowledge graph to address a similar problem to Open IE, which we call Open Knowledge Extraction (OKE) using an approach we call the Linked Open Knowledge Extractor (LOKE, pronounced like \"Loki\"). We consider the entity linking task essential to construction of real world knowledge graphs. We merge the CaRB benchmark scoring approach with data from the TekGen dataset for the LOKE task. We then show that a well engineered prompt, paired with a naive entity linking approach (which we call LOKE-GPT), outperforms AllenAI's OpenIE 4 implementation on the OKE task, although it over-generates triples compared to the reference set due to overall triple scarcity in the TekGen set. Through an analysis of entity linkability in the CaRB dataset, as well as outputs from OpenIE 4 and LOKE-GPT, we see that LOKE-GPT and the \"silver\" TekGen triples show that the task is significantly different in content from OIE, if not structure. Through this analysis and a qualitative analysis of sentence extractions via all methods, we found that LOKE-GPT extractions are of high utility for the KGC task and suitable for use in semi-automated extraction settings.

Recently, the emerging Spiking ViT approach has endeavored to harness spiking neurons, paving the way for a more brain-inspired transformer architecture that thrives in ultra-low power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. Nevertheless, this approach remains confined to spatial self-attention and doesn't fully unlock the potential of spiking neural networks. We introduce DISTA, a Denoising Spiking Transformer with Intrinsic Plasticity and SpatioTemporal Attention, designed to maximize the spatiotemporal computational prowess of spiking neurons, particularly for vision applications. DISTA explores two types of spatiotemporal attentions: intrinsic neuron-level attention and network-level attention with explicit memory. Additionally, DISTA incorporates an efficient nonlinear denoising mechanism to quell the noise inherent in computed spatiotemporal attention maps, thereby resulting in further performance gains. Our DISTA transformer undergoes joint training involving synaptic plasticity (i.e., weight tuning) and intrinsic plasticity (i.e., membrane time constant tuning) and delivers state-of-the-art performances across several static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets. With only 6 time steps, DISTA achieves remarkable top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 (96.26%) and CIFAR100 (79.15%), as well as 79.1% on CIFAR10-DVS using 10 time steps. "

        "abstract": "The transformer neural network architecture uses a form of attention in which the dot product of query and key is divided by the square root of the key dimension before applying softmax. This scaling of the dot product is designed to avoid the absolute value of the dot products becoming so large that applying softmax leads to vanishing gradients. In this paper, we propose some alternative scalings, including dividing the dot product instead by the sum of the key lengths before applying softmax. We use simulated keys and queries to show that in many situations this appears to be more effective at avoiding regions where applying softmax leads to vanishing gradients. "

However, the suggestibility transmitted through human feedback increases the inclination to produce responses that correspond to the user's beliefs or misleading prompts as opposed to true facts, a behaviour known as sycophancy. This phenomenon decreases the bias, robustness, and, consequently, their reliability. "

        "abstract": "To help address the growing demand for ever-longer sequence lengths in transformer models, Liu et al. recently proposed Ring Attention, an exact attention algorithm capable of overcoming per-device memory bottle- necks by distributing self-attention across multiple devices. In this paper, we study the performance characteristics of Ring Attention in the important special case of causal transformer models, and identify a key workload imbal- ance due to triangular structure of causal attention computations. We propose a simple extension to Ring Attention, which we call Striped Attention to fix this imbalance. Instead of devices having contiguous subsequences, each device has a subset of tokens distributed uniformly throughout the sequence, which we demonstrate leads to more even workloads. In experiments running Striped Attention on A100 GPUs and TPUv4s, we are able to achieve up to 1.45x end-to-end throughput improvements over the original Ring Attention algorithm on causal transformer training at a sequence length of 256k. Furthermore, on 16 TPUv4 chips, we were able to achieve 1.65x speedups at sequence lengths of 786k. We release the code for our experiments as open source "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09433",
        "abstract": "To ensure AI safety, instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are specifically trained to ensure alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with human intentions. While these models have demonstrated commendable results on various safety benchmarks, the vulnerability of their safety alignment has not been extensively studied. This is particularly troubling given the potential harm that LLMs can inflict. Existing attack methods on LLMs often rely on poisoned training data or the injection of malicious prompts. These approaches compromise the stealthiness and generalizability of the attacks, making them susceptible to detection. Additionally, these models often demand substantial computational resources for implementation, making them less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel attack framework, called Backdoor Activation Attack, which injects trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These malicious steering vectors can be triggered at inference time to steer the models toward attacker-desired behaviors by manipulating their activations. In particular, the steering vectors are generated by taking the difference between benign and malicious activations. Then, the most effective steering vector is selected and added to the forward passes of the LLMs. Our experiment results on four primary alignment tasks show that our proposed method is highly effective and adds little or no overhead to attack efficiency. Additionally, we discuss potential countermeasures against such activation attacks. Our code and data are available at https://email-haoran-for-link.

However, there is still a limited understanding of their trustworthiness. Deploying these models at scale without sufficient trustworthiness can pose significant risks, highlighting the need to uncover these issues promptly. In this work, we conduct an assessment of open-source LLMs on trustworthiness, scrutinizing them across eight different aspects including toxicity, stereotypes, ethics, hallucination, fairness, sycophancy, privacy, and robustness against adversarial demonstrations. We propose an enhanced Chain of Utterances-based (CoU) prompting strategy by incorporating meticulously crafted malicious demonstrations for trustworthiness attack. Our extensive experiments encompass recent and representative series of open-source LLMs, including Vicuna, MPT, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. The empirical outcomes underscore the efficacy of our attack strategy across diverse aspects. More interestingly, our result analysis reveals that models with superior performance in general NLP tasks do not always have greater trustworthiness; in fact, larger models can be more vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, models that have undergone instruction tuning, focusing on instruction following, tend to be more susceptible, although fine-tuning LLMs for safety alignment proves effective in mitigating adversarial trustworthiness attacks.

We introduce CustomPlans, a probe dataset of customization hints that encodes diverse user needs for open-domain How-to procedures. Using LLMs as CustomizationAgent and ExecutionAgent in different settings, we establish their abilities to perform open-domain procedure customization. Human evaluation shows that using these agents in a Sequential setting is the best, but they are good enough only ~51% of the time. Error analysis shows that LLMs do not sufficiently address user customization needs in their generated procedures. "

We leverage several purpose-built Language Models, including BERT, Chat-based, and text-to-transfer-based models, for text understanding, classification, generation, and summarization. The official results of the TREC evaluation contradict our initial self-evaluation, which may suggest that a decrease in the reliance on our retrieval and classification methods is better.

To address this gap, we propose the task of grammar error explanation, where a system needs to provide one-sentence explanations for each grammatical error in a pair of erroneous and corrected sentences. We analyze the capability of GPT-4 in grammar error explanation, and find that it only produces explanations for 60.2% of the errors using one-shot prompting. To improve upon this performance, we develop a two-step pipeline that leverages fine-tuned and prompted large language models to perform structured atomic token edit extraction, followed by prompting GPT-4 to generate explanations. We evaluate our pipeline on German and Chinese grammar error correction data sampled from language learners with a wide range of proficiency levels. Human evaluation reveals that our pipeline produces 93.9% and 98.0% correct explanations for German and Chinese data, respectively.

However, learning to parse to rare domain-specific languages (DSLs) from just a few demonstrations is challenging, limiting the performance of even the most capable LLMs. In this work, we improve the effectiveness of ICL for semantic parsing by (1) using general-purpose programming languages such as Python instead of DSLs, and (2) augmenting prompts with a structured domain description that includes, e.g., the available classes and functions. We show that both these changes significantly improve accuracy across three popular datasets. Combined, they lead to dramatic improvements (e.g. 7.9% to 66.5% on SMCalFlow compositional split), nearly closing the performance gap between easier i.i.d.\\ and harder compositional splits when used with a strong model, and reducing the need for a large number of demonstrations. We find that the resemblance of the target parse language to general-purpose code is a more important factor than the language's popularity in pre-training corpora. Our findings provide an improved methodology for building semantic parsers in the modern context of ICL with LLMs. "

The spatial information in these images reflects the object's texture features, while the spectral information reveals the potential spectral representations across different bands. Currently, the understanding of high-dimensional images remains limited to a single-domain perspective with performance degradation. Motivated by the masking texture effect observed in the human visual system, we present a multi-domain diffusion-driven feature learning network (MDFL) , a scheme to redefine the effective information domain that the model really focuses on. This method employs diffusion-based posterior sampling to explicitly consider joint information interactions between the high-dimensional manifold structures in the spectral, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby eliminating the influence of masking texture effects in visual models. Additionally, we introduce a feature reuse mechanism to gather deep and raw features of high-dimensional data. We demonstrate that MDFL significantly improves the feature extraction performance of high-dimensional data, thereby providing a powerful aid for revealing the intrinsic patterns and structures of such data. The experimental results on three multi-modal remote sensing datasets show that MDFL reaches an average overall accuracy of 98.25%, outperforming various state-of-the-art baseline schemes.

Towards this end, this paper focuses on improving grounding from a holistic perspective with a novel framework, AGREE, Adaptation of LLMs for GRounding EnhancEment. We start with the design of an iterative test-time adaptation (TTA) capability that takes into account the support information generated in self-grounded responses. To effectively enable this capability, we tune LLMs to ground the claims in their responses to retrieved documents by providing citations. This tuning on top of the pre-trained LLMs requires a small amount of data that needs to be constructed in a particular way to learn the grounding information, for which we introduce a data construction method. Our results show that the tuning-based AGREE framework generates better grounded responses with more accurate citations compared to prompting-based approaches. "

Backdoor-based watermarking is a viable approach to protect the copyright of classification datasets.

To address these issues, we propose FunctionMarker, a novel copyright protection method for language datasets via knowledge injection. FunctionMarker enables LLMs to learn specific knowledge through fine-tuning on watermarked datasets, and we can extract the embedded watermark by obtaining the responses of LLMs to specific knowledge-related queries. Considering watermark capacity and stealthness, we select customizable functions as specific knowledge for LLMs to learn and embed the watermark into them. Moreover, FunctionMarker can embed multi-bit watermarks while preserving the original semantic information, thereby increasing the difficulty of adaptive attacks. We take mathematical functions as an instance to evaluate the effectiveness of FunctionMarker, and experiments show that only 0.3% of watermarked text achieves a 90% watermark extraction accuracy in most cases, validating our method's effectiveness.

In this paper, we propose a Temporal-Aware Refining Network (TAR), to synchronously explore temporal-aware global and local image features for accurate pose and shape recovery. First, a global transformer encoder is introduced to obtain temporal global features from static feature sequences. Second, a bidirectional ConvGRU network takes the sequence of high-resolution feature maps as input, and outputs temporal local feature maps that maintain high resolution and capture the local motion of the human body. Finally, a recurrent refinement module iteratively updates estimated SMPL parameters by leveraging both global and local temporal information to achieve accurate and smooth results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TAR obtains more accurate results than previous state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, i.e., 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M. "

Despite many proposed reasoning methods aimed at enhancing performance in downstream tasks, two fundamental questions persist: Does reasoning genuinely support predictions, and how reliable is the quality of reasoning? In this paper, we propose a framework \\textsc{SCORE} to analyze how well LLMs can reason. Specifically, we focus on self-contradictory reasoning, where reasoning does not support the prediction. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves when performing reasoning tasks that involve contextual information and commonsense. The model may miss evidence or use shortcuts, thereby exhibiting self-contradictory behaviors. We also employ the Point-of-View (POV) method, which probes models to generate reasoning from multiple perspectives, as a diagnostic tool for further analysis. We find that though LLMs may appear to perform well in one-perspective settings, they fail to stabilize such behavior in multi-perspectives settings. Even for correct predictions, the reasoning may be messy and incomplete, and LLMs can easily be led astray from good reasoning. \\textsc{SCORE}'s results underscore the lack of robustness required for trustworthy reasoning and the urgency for further research to establish best practices for a comprehensive evaluation of reasoning beyond accuracy-based metrics.

        "abstract": "The inevitable appearance of spurious correlations in training datasets hurts the generalization of NLP models on unseen data. Previous work has found that datasets with paired inputs are prone to correlations between a specific part of the input (e.g., the hypothesis in NLI) and the label; consequently, models trained only on those outperform chance. Are these correlations picked up by models trained on the full input data? To address this question, we propose a new evaluation method, Counterfactual Attentiveness Test (CAT). CAT uses counterfactuals by replacing part of the input with its counterpart from a different example (subject to some restrictions), expecting an attentive model to change its prediction. Using CAT, we systematically investigate established supervised and in-context learning models on ten datasets spanning four tasks: natural language inference, reading comprehension, paraphrase detection, and visual & language reasoning. CAT reveals that reliance on such correlations is mainly data-dependent. Surprisingly, we find that GPT3 becomes less attentive with an increased number of demonstrations, while its accuracy on the test data improves. Our results demonstrate that augmenting training or demonstration data with counterfactuals is effective in improving models' attentiveness. We show that models' attentiveness measured by CAT reveals different conclusions from solely measuring correlations in data. "

We propose a novel metric, GistScore, based on Example Gisting, a novel approach for training example retrievers for ICL using an attention bottleneck via Gisting, a recent technique for compressing task instructions. To tradeoff performance with ease of use, we experiment with both fine-tuning gist models on each dataset and multi-task training a single model on a large collection of datasets. On 21 diverse datasets spanning 9 tasks, we show that our fine-tuned models get state-of-the-art ICL performance with 20% absolute average gain over off-the-shelf retrievers and 7% over the best prior methods. Our multi-task model generalizes well out-of-the-box to new task categories, datasets, and prompt templates with retrieval speeds that are consistently thousands of times faster than the best prior training-free method.

        "abstract": "Understanding visually situated language requires recognizing text and visual elements, and interpreting complex layouts. State-of-the-art methods commonly use specialized pre-processing tools, such as optical character recognition (OCR) systems, that map document image inputs to extracted information in the space of textual tokens, and sometimes also employ large language models (LLMs) to reason in text token space. However, the gains from external tools and LLMs come at the cost of increased computational and engineering complexity. In this paper, we ask whether small pretrained image-to-text models can learn selective text or layout recognition and reasoning as an intermediate inference step in an end-to-end model for pixel-level visual language understanding. We incorporate the outputs of such OCR tools, LLMs, and larger multimodal models as intermediate ``rationales'' on training data, and train a small student model to predict both rationales and answers for input questions based on those training examples. A student model based on Pix2Struct (282M parameters) achieves consistent improvements on three visual document understanding benchmarks representing infographics, scanned documents, and figures, with improvements of more than 4\\% absolute over a comparable Pix2Struct model that predicts answers directly.

        "abstract": "While LLMs can provide reasoned explanations along with their answers, the nature and quality of those explanations are still poorly understood. In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critiquing model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models. "

        "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) is an emergent capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Only a few demonstrations enable LLMs to be used as blackbox for new tasks. Previous studies have shown that using LLMs' outputs as labels is effective in training models to select demonstrations. Such a label is expected to estimate utility of a demonstration in ICL; however, it has not been well understood how different labeling strategies affect results on target tasks. This paper presents an analysis on different utility functions by focusing on LLMs' output probability given ground-truth output, and task-specific reward given LLMs' prediction. Unlike the previous work, we introduce a novel labeling method, incremental utility, which estimates how much incremental knowledge is brought into the LLMs by a demonstration. We conduct experiments with instruction-tuned LLMs on binary/multi-class classification, segmentation, and translation across Arabic, English, Finnish, Japanese, and Spanish. Our results show that (1) the probability is effective when the probability values are distributed across the whole value range (on the classification tasks), and (2) the downstream metric is more robust when nuanced reward values are provided with long outputs (on the segmentation and translation tasks). We then show that the proposed incremental utility further helps ICL by contrasting how the LLMs perform with and without the demonstrations. "

To address these issues, we propose DECDM, an end-to-end document-level image translation method inspired by recent advances in diffusion models. Our method overcomes the limitations of paired training by independently training the source (noisy input) and target (clean output) models, making it possible to apply domain-specific diffusion models to other pairs. DECDM trains on one dataset at a time, eliminating the need to scan both datasets concurrently, and effectively preserving data privacy from the source or target domain. We also introduce simple data augmentation strategies to improve character-glyph conservation during translation. We compare DECDM with state-of-the-art methods on multiple synthetic data and benchmark datasets, such as document denoising and {\\color{black}shadow} removal, and demonstrate the superiority of performance quantitatively and qualitatively.

Our empirical evaluation, conducted using a variety of state-of-the-art methods, establishes robust base-lines for OCKL.

These results raise several open questions: whether demonstrations of library usage is required, whether smaller (and more open) models also possess such capabilities, etc. In this work, we take a broader approach by systematically evaluating a diverse array of LLMs across three scenarios reflecting varying levels of domain specialization to understand their abilities and limitations in generating code based on libraries defined in-context. Our results show that even smaller open-source LLMs like Llama-2 and StarCoder demonstrate an adept understanding of novel code libraries based on specification presented in-context. Our findings further reveal that LLMs exhibit a surprisingly high proficiency in learning novel library modules even when provided with just natural language descriptions or raw code implementations of the functions, which are often cheaper to obtain than demonstrations. Overall, our results pave the way for harnessing LLMs in more adaptable and dynamic coding environments. "

To assess the red-teaming of RLHF against human preference data poisoning, we propose RankPoison, a poisoning attack method on candidates' selection of preference rank flipping to reach certain malicious behaviors (e.g., generating longer sequences, which can increase the computational cost). With poisoned dataset generated by RankPoison, we can perform poisoning attacks on LLMs to generate longer tokens without hurting the original safety alignment performance. Moreover, applying RankPoison, we also successfully implement a backdoor attack where LLMs can generate longer answers under questions with the trigger word.

Our method takes the best of two worlds: joint aperture-exposure coding for compressive light-field acquisition, and a neural radiance field (NeRF) for view synthesis. Joint aperture-exposure coding implemented in a camera enables effective embedding of 3-D scene information into an observed image, but in previous works, it was used only for reconstructing discretized light-field views. NeRF-based neural rendering enables high quality view synthesis of a 3-D scene from continuous viewpoints, but when only a single image is given as the input, it struggles to achieve satisfactory quality. Our method integrates these two techniques into an efficient and end-to-end trainable pipeline. Trained on a wide variety of scenes, our method can reconstruct continuous light fields accurately and efficiently without any test time optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first work to bridge two worlds: camera design for efficiently acquiring 3-D information and neural rendering. "

We design specific prompts for extracting event causal relations from GPT. Against human-annotated event causal relations in the GLUCOSE dataset, our technique performs on par with supervised models, while being easily generalizable to stories of different types and lengths.

In this paper, we introduce sparsity in both keypoint token attention and visual token attention to improve human pose estimation. Experimental results on the MPII dataset demonstrate that our model has a higher level of accuracy and proved the feasibility of the method, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

We propose InstructChem, a new structured reasoning approach that substantially boosts the LLMs' chemical reasoning capabilities. InstructChem explicitly decomposes the reasoning into three critical phrases, including chemical formulae generation by LLMs that offers the basis for subsequent grounded reasoning, step-by-step reasoning that makes multi-step derivations with the identified formulae for a preliminary answer, and iterative review-and-refinement that steers LLMs to progressively revise the previous phases for increasing confidence, leading to the final high-confidence answer. We conduct extensive experiments on four different chemistry challenges, including quantum chemistry, quantum mechanics, physical chemistry, and chemistry kinetics. Our approach significantly enhances GPT-4 on chemistry reasoning, yielding an 8% average absolute improvement and a 30% peak improvement. We further use the generated reasoning by GPT-4 to fine-tune smaller LMs (e.g., Vicuna) and observe strong improvement of the smaller LMs. This validates our approach and enables LLMs to generate high-quality reasoning.

In this work, we propose to improve the quality of texts generated by a watermarked language model by Watermarking with Importance Scoring (WIS). At each generation step, we estimate the importance of the token to generate, and prevent it from being impacted by watermarking if it is important for the semantic correctness of the output. We further propose three methods to predict importance scoring, including a perturbation-based method and two model-based methods.

A predominant issue is the propensity for these models to generate non-existent facts, a concern termed hallucination. Our research is motivated by the observation that previous instruction tuning methods force the model to complete a sentence no matter whether the model knows the knowledge or not. When the question is out of the parametric knowledge, it will try to make up something and fail to indicate when it lacks knowledge. In this paper, we present a new approach called Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning). This approach is formalized by first identifying the knowledge gap between parametric knowledge and the instruction tuning data. Then, we construct the refusal-aware data based on the knowledge intersection, to tune LLMs to refrain from responding to questions beyond its parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate this new instruction tuning approach effectively improves a model's ability to answer known questions and refrain from answering unknown questions. Furthermore, when tested on out-of-domain datasets, the refusal ability was found to be a meta-skill that could be generalized to other tasks. Further analysis surprisingly finds that learning the uncertainty during training displays a better ability to estimate uncertainty than uncertainty-based testing.

The setting requires circumventing a cognitive bias known in psychology as ''functional fixedness'' to use familiar objects in innovative or unconventional ways. To this end, we create MacGyver, an automatically generated dataset consisting of 1,600 real-world problems that deliberately trigger functional fixedness and require thinking 'out-of-the-box'. We then present our collection of problems to both LLMs and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. We show that MacGyver is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For example, humans typically excel in solving problems that they are familiar with but may struggle with tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. On the other hand, LLMs, being exposed to a variety of highly specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but are prone to overconfidence and propose actions that are physically infeasible or inefficient. We also provide a detailed error analysis of LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking. This work provides insight into the creative problem-solving capabilities of humans and AI and illustrates how psychological paradigms can be extended into large-scale tasks for comparing humans and machines.

While lexical shortlisting is well-explored in tasks like machine translation, it requires modifications before being suitable for LLMs as the intended applications vary significantly. Our work studies two heuristics to shortlist sub-vocabulary at LLM inference time: Unicode-based script filtering and corpus-based selection. We explore different LLM families and sizes, and we find that lexical shortlisting can reduce the memory usage of some models by nearly 50\\% and has an upper bound of 25\\% improvement in generation speed. In this pilot study, we also identify the drawbacks of such vocabulary selection methods and propose avenues for future research. "

        "abstract": "The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) on natural language understanding tasks has made them popular for research in social sciences. In particular, to properly understand the properties and innate personas of LLMs, researchers have performed studies that involve using prompts in the form of questions that ask LLMs of particular opinions. In this study, we take a cautionary step back and examine whether the current format of prompting enables LLMs to provide responses in a consistent and robust manner. We first construct a dataset that contains 693 questions encompassing 39 different instruments of persona measurement on 115 persona axes. Additionally, we design a set of prompts containing minor variations and examine LLM's capabilities to generate accurate answers, as well as consistency variations to examine their consistency towards simple perturbations such as switching the option order. Our experiments on 15 different open-source LLMs reveal that even simple perturbations are sufficient to significantly downgrade a model's question-answering ability, and that most LLMs have low negation consistency. Our results suggest that the currently widespread practice of prompting is insufficient to accurately capture model perceptions, and we discuss potential alternatives to improve such issues. "

        "abstract": "This study introduces a new long-form database question answering dataset designed to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with a SQL interpreter. The task necessitates LLMs to strategically generate multiple SQL queries to retrieve sufficient data from a database, to reason with the acquired context, and to synthesize them into a comprehensive analytical narrative. Our findings highlight that this task poses great challenges even for the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model. We propose and evaluate two interaction strategies, and provide a fine-grained analysis of the individual stages within the interaction. A key discovery is the identification of two primary bottlenecks hindering effective interaction: the capacity for planning and the ability to generate multiple SQL queries. To address the challenge of accurately assessing answer quality, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates the academic peer-review process, enhancing the precision and reliability of our evaluations. This framework allows for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in complex retrieval and reasoning tasks. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining accuracy across a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps in mathematical reasoning, leading to error propagation that undermines the final result. The current methodology to mitigate this issue primarily involves using a verifier model to assess the correctness of generated solution candidates, focusing either on the overall reasoning path or on an incomplete reasoning path. By rethinking this approach, we argue that assessing potentials of incomplete reasoning paths could be more advantageous as it guides towards correct final answers, transforming the task into a \\textit{planning} problem. Our proposed verifier, the Outcome-supervision Value Model (OVM), employs outcome supervision for training, offering an efficient and intuitive method for \\textit{planning} by prioritizing steps that lead to accurate conclusions over mere per-step correctness. Furthermore, the OVM eschews the need for labor-intensive annotations on step-level correctness, enhancing its scalability. Our experiments on two multi-step mathematical reasoning datasets, GSM8K and Game of 24, demonstrate the superior performance of the OVM model. Notably, in GSM8K, our \\textbf{OVM-7B model achieves state-of-the-art results among LLMs up to 13B parameters}; especially it does not utilize GPT-4 or code execution. These findings offer a novel perspective on the role of outcome supervision in training verifiers for multi-step reasoning tasks and provide theoretical justification for its advantage in value estimation for planning.

        "abstract": "Fully supervised change detection methods have achieved significant advancements in performance, yet they depend severely on acquiring costly pixel-level labels. Considering that the patch-level annotations also contain abundant information corresponding to both changed and unchanged objects in bi-temporal images, an intuitive solution is to segment the changes with patch-level annotations. How to capture the semantic variations associated with the changed and unchanged regions from the patch-level annotations to obtain promising change results is the critical challenge for the weakly supervised change detection task. In this paper, we propose a memory-supported transformer (MS-Former), a novel framework consisting of a bi-directional attention block (BAB) and a patch-level supervision scheme (PSS) tailored for weakly supervised change detection with patch-level annotations. More specifically, the BAM captures contexts associated with the changed and unchanged regions from the temporal difference features to construct informative prototypes stored in the memory bank. On the other hand, the BAM extracts useful information from the prototypes as supplementary contexts to enhance the temporal difference features, thereby better distinguishing changed and unchanged regions. After that, the PSS guides the network learning valuable knowledge from the patch-level annotations, thus further elevating the performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in the change detection task. The demo code for our work will be publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/guanyuezhen/MS-Former}. "

        "abstract": "Human perception of language depends on personal backgrounds like gender and ethnicity. While existing studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) hold values that are closer to certain societal groups, it is unclear whether their prediction behaviors on subjective NLP tasks also exhibit a similar bias. In this study, leveraging the POPQUORN dataset which contains annotations of diverse demographic backgrounds, we conduct a series of experiments on four popular LLMs to investigate their capability to understand group differences and potential biases in their predictions for politeness and offensiveness. We find that for both tasks, model predictions are closer to the labels from White and female participants. We further explore prompting with the target demographic labels and show that including the target demographic in the prompt actually worsens the model's performance. More specifically, when being prompted to respond from the perspective of \"Black\" and \"Asian\" individuals, models show lower performance in predicting both overall scores as well as the scores from corresponding groups. Our results suggest that LLMs hold gender and racial biases for subjective NLP tasks and that demographic-infused prompts alone may be insufficient to mitigate such effects.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle when faced with situations where they lack the prerequisite knowledge to generate a sensical response. In these cases, models tend to fabricate and hallucinate, rather than appropriately signaling uncertainty as humans would. This behavior misaligns with human conversational norms and presents challenges surrounding responsible and ethical AI development. This work aims to systematically investigate LLMs' behaviors in such situations. We curate an adversarial question-answering benchmark containing unanswerable questions targeting information absent from the LLM's training data. Concretely, these unanswerable questions contain non-existent concepts or false premises. When presented with such unanswerable questions, an LLM should appropriately convey uncertainty, and be able to challenge the premise and refuse to generate a response. While facing answerable valid questions, a model should demonstrate a positive correlation between accuracy and confidence. Using a model-agnostic unified confidence elicitation approach, we observe that LLMs that have gone through instruction finetuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) perform significantly better than their counterparts that do not. Moreover, uncertainty expression 1 through our elicitation method does not always stay consistent with the perceived confidence of the direct response of an LLM. Our findings call for further research into teaching LLMs to proactively and reliably express uncertainty. "

Moral theories have been applied to news analysis studying moral values in isolation, while the intricate dynamics among participating entities in shaping moral events have been overlooked.

To study this phenomenon, we first annotate a new dataset, MORAL EVENTS, consisting of 5,494 structured annotations on 474 news articles by diverse US media across the political spectrum. We further propose MOKA, a moral event extraction framework with MOral Knowledge Augmentation, that leverages knowledge derived from moral words and moral scenarios. Experimental results show that MOKA outperforms competitive baselines across three moral event understanding tasks. Further analyses illuminate the selective reporting of moral events by media outlets of different ideological leanings, suggesting the significance of event-level morality analysis in news.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of Generative Engines (GEs), has the potential to generate accurate and personalized responses, and is rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them with the help of LLMs. While this shift significantly improves \\textit{user} utility and \\textit{generative search engine} traffic, it results in a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of Generative Engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, the right tools should be provided to ensure that creator economy is not severely disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), a novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving the visibility of their content in Generative Engine responses through a black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation in this new paradigm by introducing GEO-bench, a benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, coupled with sources required to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we show that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific methods.

Using this schema, we collect extensive annotations for 700 abstracts from two sources: clinical trials and case reports. We also benchmark the performance of various state-of-the-art IE systems on our dataset, including extractive models and generative LLMs in fully supervised and limited data settings.

        "abstract": "In this work, we take a first step towards designing summarization systems that are faithful to the author's opinions and perspectives. Focusing on a case study of preserving political perspectives in news summarization, we find that existing approaches alter the political opinions and stances of news articles in more than 50% of summaries, misrepresenting the intent and perspectives of the news authors. We thus propose P^3Sum, a diffusion model-based summarization approach controlled by political perspective classifiers. In P^3Sum, the political leaning of a generated summary is iteratively evaluated at each decoding step, and any drift from the article's original stance incurs a loss back-propagated to the embedding layers, steering the political stance of the summary at inference time. Extensive experiments on three news summarization datasets demonstrate that P^3Sum outperforms state-of-the-art summarization systems and large language models by up to 11.4% in terms of the success rate of stance preservation, with on-par performance on standard summarization utility metrics. These findings highlight the lacunae that even for state-of-the-art models it is still challenging to preserve author perspectives in news summarization, while P^3Sum presents an important first step towards evaluating and developing summarization systems that are faithful to author intent and perspectives.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have advanced generative AI significantly in terms of editing and creating naturalistic images. However, efficiently improving generated image quality is still of paramount interest. In this context, we propose a generic \"naturalness\" preserving loss function, viz., kurtosis concentration (KC) loss, which can be readily applied to any standard diffusion model pipeline to elevate the image quality. Our motivation stems from the projected kurtosis concentration property of natural images, which states that natural images have nearly constant kurtosis values across different band-pass versions of the image. To retain the \"naturalness\" of the generated images, we enforce reducing the gap between the highest and lowest kurtosis values across the band-pass versions (e.g., Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)) of images. Note that our approach does not require any additional guidance like classifier or classifier-free guidance to improve the image quality. We validate the proposed approach for three diverse tasks, viz., (1) personalized few-shot finetuning using text guidance, (2) unconditional image generation, and (3) image super-resolution. Integrating the proposed KC loss has improved the perceptual quality across all these tasks in terms of both FID, MUSIQ score, and user evaluation. "

We introduce the FairytaleCQA dataset, which is annotated by children education experts, to supplement 278 storybook narratives with educationally appropriate commonsense knowledge. The dataset has 5,868 QA pairs that not only originate from the storybook narrative but also contain the commonsense knowledge grounded by an external knowledge graph (i.e., ConceptNet). A follow-up experiment shows that a smaller model (T5-large) fine-tuned with FairytaleCQA reliably outperforms much larger prompt-engineered LLM (e.g., GPT-4) in this new QA-pair generation task (QAG). This result suggests that: 1) our dataset brings novel challenges to existing LLMs, and 2) human experts' data annotation are still critical as they have much nuanced knowledge that LLMs do not know in the children educational domain.

First, exemplar pools are created to represent the types of contexts where each LM provides a more reliable answer, leveraging a sentence embedding fine-tuned so that context similarity is close to dialogue state similarity. Then, during inference, the k-nearest exemplars to the testing instance are retrieved, and the instance is routed according to majority vote.

In this study, we leverage text-conditional diffusion models (DMs), known for their impressive text-to-image synthesis capabilities, for STISR tasks. Our experimental results revealed that text-conditional DMs notably surpass existing STISR methods. Especially when texts from LR text images are given as input, the text-conditional DMs are able to produce superior quality super-resolution text images. Utilizing this capability, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing LR-HR paired text image datasets. This framework consists of three specialized text-conditional DMs, each dedicated to text image synthesis, super-resolution, and image degradation. These three modules are vital for synthesizing distinct LR and HR paired images, which are more suitable for training STISR methods.

To address them, we propose a graph-guided CoT prompting method, which guides the LLMs to reach the correct answer with graph representation/verification steps. Specifically, we first leverage LLMs to construct a \"question/rationale graph\" by using knowledge extraction prompting given the initial question and the rationales generated in the previous steps. Then, the graph verification step diagnoses the current rationale triplet by comparing it with the existing question/rationale graph to filter out irrelevant rationales and generate follow-up questions to obtain relevant information. Additionally, we generate CoT paths that exclude the extracted graph information to represent the context information missed from the graph extraction. Our graph-guided reasoning method shows superior performance compared to previous CoT prompting and the variants on multi-hop question answering benchmark datasets. "

Defensive demonstrations are designed to counteract the adverse effects of triggers, aiming to recalibrate and correct the behavior of poisoned models during test-time evaluations. Extensive experiments show that defensive demonstrations are effective in defending both instance-level and instruction-level backdoor attacks, not only rectifying the behavior of poisoned models but also surpassing existing baselines in most scenarios.

This issue is especially critical for closed-source models and certain open-source models where training data transparency is lacking. In this paper we study data contamination by proposing two methods tailored for both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We first introduce a retrieval-based system to explore potential overlaps between evaluation benchmarks and pretraining corpora. We further present a novel investigation protocol named \\textbf{T}estset \\textbf{S}lot Guessing (\\textit{TS-Guessing}), applicable to both open and proprietary models. This approach entails masking a wrong answer in a multiple-choice question and prompting the model to fill in the gap. Additionally, it involves obscuring an unlikely word in an evaluation example and asking the model to produce it. We find that certain commercial LLMs could surprisingly guess the missing option in various test sets. Specifically, in the TruthfulQA benchmark, we find that LLMs exhibit notable performance improvement when provided with additional metadata in the benchmark. Further, in the MMLU benchmark, ChatGPT and GPT-4 demonstrated an exact match rate of 52\\% and 57\\%, respectively, in guessing the missing options in benchmark test data.

To alleviate this, we propose including some of a user's preferences and instructions in natural language -- collectively termed standing instructions -- as additional context for such interfaces. For example, when a user states I'm hungry, their previously expressed preference for Persian food will be automatically added to the LLM prompt, so as to influence the search for relevant restaurants. We develop NLSI, a language-to-program dataset consisting of over 2.4K dialogues spanning 17 domains, where each dialogue is paired with a user profile (a set of users specific standing instructions) and corresponding structured representations (API calls). A key challenge in NLSI is to identify which subset of the standing instructions is applicable to a given dialogue. NLSI contains diverse phenomena, from simple preferences to interdependent instructions such as triggering a hotel search whenever the user is booking tickets to an event. We conduct experiments on NLSI using prompting with large language models and various retrieval approaches, achieving a maximum of 44.7% exact match on API prediction.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09799",
        "abstract": "Collecting diverse human data on subjective NLP topics is costly and challenging. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed human-like capabilities, there is a recent trend in collaborative efforts between humans and LLMs for generating diverse data, offering potential scalable and efficient solutions. However, the extent of LLMs' capability to generate diverse perspectives on subjective topics remains an unexplored question. In this study, we investigate LLMs' capacity for generating diverse perspectives and rationales on subjective topics, such as social norms and argumentative texts. We formulate this problem as diversity extraction in LLMs and propose a criteria-based prompting technique to ground diverse opinions and measure perspective diversity from the generated criteria words. Our results show that measuring semantic diversity through sentence embeddings and distance metrics is not enough to measure perspective diversity. To see how far we can extract diverse perspectives from LLMs, or called diversity coverage, we employ a step-by-step recall prompting for generating more outputs from the model in an iterative manner. As we apply our prompting method to other tasks (hate speech labeling and story continuation), indeed we find that LLMs are able to generate diverse opinions according to the degree of task subjectivity.

However, most modern large language models suffer from hallucinations, that is, they generate responses not supported by or contradicting the knowledge source. To mitigate the issue and increase faithfulness of information-seeking dialogue systems, we introduce BeInfo, a simple yet effective method that applies behavioural tuning to aid information-seeking dialogue. Relying on three standard datasets, we show that models tuned with BeInfo} become considerably more faithful to the knowledge source both for datasets and domains seen during BeInfo-tuning, as well as on unseen domains, when applied in a zero-shot manner. In addition, we show that the models with 3B parameters (e.g., Flan-T5) tuned with BeInfo demonstrate strong performance on data from real `production' conversations and outperform GPT4 when tuned on a limited amount of such realistic in-domain dialogues.

Specifically, our customized meta-interpreters allow the production of reasoning proofs and support flexible search strategies. These reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable because of the deterministic executing nature of the symbolic solvers. Empirically, on ProofWriter, our method surpasses the CoT baseline by nearly double in accuracy and more than triple in proof similarity.

This paper introduces DocMath-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the numerical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing financial documents containing both text and tables. We evaluate a wide spectrum of 19 LLMs, including those specialized in coding and finance. We also incorporate different prompting strategies (i.e., Chain-of-Thoughts and Program-of-Thoughts) to comprehensively assess the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in DocMath-Eval. We found that, although the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4), can perform well on simple problems such as calculating the rate of increase in a financial metric within a short document context, it significantly lags behind human experts in more complex problems grounded in longer contexts. We believe DocMath-Eval can be used as a valuable benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities to solve challenging numerical reasoning problems in expert domains.

Ideally, 3D reconstruction methods should generate high-fidelity results with 3D consistency in real-time. Traditional methods match pixels between images using photo-consistency constraints or learned features, while differentiable rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) use surface-based representations or differentiable volume rendering to generate high-fidelity scenes. However, these methods require excessive runtime for rendering, making them impractical for daily applications. To address these challenges, we present $\\textbf{EvaSurf}$, an $\\textbf{E}$fficient $\\textbf{V}$iew-$\\textbf{A}$ware Implicit Textured $\\textbf{Surf}$ace Reconstruction method on Mobile Devices. In our method, we first employ an efficient surface-based model with a multi-view supervision module to ensure accurate mesh creation. To enable high-fidelity rendering, we learn an implicit texture embedded with a set of Gaussian lobes to capture view-dependent information. Furthermore, With the explicit geometry and the implicit texture, we can employ a lightweight neural shader to reduce the expense of computation and further support real-time rendering on common mobile devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-quality appearance and accurate mesh on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Moreover, our method can be trained in just 1-2 hours using a single GPU and run on mobile devices at over 40FPS (Frames Per Second), with a final package required for rendering taking up only 40-50 MB.

To assess this, we developed a set of novel metrics targeting lexical, syntactic, and semantic diversity, applying them in recursive fine-tuning experiments across various natural language generation tasks. Our findings reveal a marked decrease in the diversity of the models' outputs through successive iterations. This trend underscores the potential risks of training LLMs on predecessor-generated text, particularly concerning the preservation of linguistic richness. Our study highlights the need for careful consideration of the long-term effects of such training approaches on the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. "

Significant research efforts have been devoted to the first two scenarios compared to the latter. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the task of detecting propagandistic textual spans. We investigate whether large language models such as GPT-4 can be utilized to perform the task of an annotator. For the experiments, we used an in-house developed dataset consisting of annotations from multiple annotators. Our results suggest that providing more information to the model as prompts improves the annotation agreement and performance compared to human annotations.

        "abstract": "Amidst growing concerns of large language models (LLMs) being misused for generating misinformation or completing homework assignments, watermarking has emerged as an effective solution for distinguishing human-written and LLM-generated text. A prominent watermarking strategy is to embed a signal into generated text by upsampling a (pseudorandomly-chosen) subset of tokens at every generation step. Although this signal is imperceptible to a human reader, it is detectable through statistical testing. However, implanting such signals alters the model's output distribution and can have unintended effects when watermarked LLMs are used for downstream applications. In this work, we evaluate the performance of watermarked LLMs on a diverse suite of tasks, including text classification, textual entailment, reasoning, question answering, translation, summarization, and language modeling. We find that watermarking has negligible impact on the performance of tasks posed as k-class classification problems in the average case. However, the accuracy can plummet to that of a random classifier for some scenarios (that occur with non-negligible probability). Tasks that are cast as multiple-choice questions and short-form generation are surprisingly unaffected by watermarking. For long-form generation tasks, including summarization and translation, we see a drop of 15-20% in the performance due to watermarking. Our findings highlight the trade-offs that users should be cognizant of when using watermarked models, and point to cases where future research could improve existing trade-offs. "

Specifically, we modify the self-attention mechanism in vanilla Transformer, enabling it to reason over the <human, action, object> triplet and constitute novel interactions. Meanwhile, such reasoning process is guided by two crucial properties for understanding HOI: affordances (the potential actions an object can facilitate) and proxemics (the spatial relations between humans and objects). We formulate these two properties in first-order logic and ground them into continuous space to constrain the learning process of our approach, leading to improved performance and zero-shot generalization capabilities. We evaluate L OGIC HOI on V-COCO and HICO-DET under both normal and zero-shot setups, achieving significant improvements over existing methods. "

In this work, we conduct an empirical experiment on four datasets from three different domains comparing SOTA LLMs with small models trained on expert annotations with AL. We found that small models can outperform GPT-3.5 with a few hundreds of labeled data, and they achieve higher or similar performance with GPT-4 despite that they are hundreds time smaller. Based on these findings, we posit that LLM predictions can be used as a warmup method in real-world applications and human experts remain indispensable in tasks involving data annotation driven by domain-specific knowledge.

In this paper, we investigate a novel category of jailbreak attacks specifically designed to target the cognitive structure and processes of LLMs. Specifically, we analyze the safety vulnerability of LLMs in the face of (1) multilingual cognitive overload, (2) veiled expression, and (3) effect-to-cause reasoning. Different from previous jailbreak attacks, our proposed cognitive overload is a black-box attack with no need for knowledge of model architecture or access to model weights. Experiments conducted on AdvBench and MasterKey reveal that various LLMs, including both popular open-source model Llama 2 and the proprietary model ChatGPT, can be compromised through cognitive overload. Motivated by cognitive psychology work on managing cognitive load, we further investigate defending cognitive overload attack from two perspectives. Empirical studies show that our cognitive overload from three perspectives can jailbreak all studied LLMs successfully, while existing defense strategies can hardly mitigate the caused malicious uses effectively.

However, these benchmarks are limited to a single language and are constructed using automated approaches, which restricts their applicability and the quality of the test examples they contain. To bridge this gap, we introduce the FollowEval benchmark in this paper. This benchmark is composed of instances in both English and Chinese, and all test examples are crafted by human experts. Furthermore, the FollowEval benchmark is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions of instruction following: string manipulation, commonsense reasoning, logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, and response constraints. To enhance the complexity and present a sufficient challenge, each test example is designed to evaluate more than one dimension. We have evaluated various LLMs using the FollowEval benchmark and found that their performance significantly lags behind that of humans. This highlights the considerable room for improvement in the instruction-following ability of these models. "

We present theoretical analyses and empirical evidence demonstrating that XMark substantially enhances text generation fluency while maintaining watermark detectability.

Currently, however, generating language via BCIs has been previously successful only within a classification setup for selecting pre-generated sentence continuation candidates with the most likely cortical semantic representation. Inspired by recent research that revealed associations between the brain and the large computational language models, we propose a generative language BCI that utilizes the capacity of a large language model (LLM) jointly with a semantic brain decoder to directly generate language from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) input. The proposed model can generate coherent language sequences aligned with the semantic content of visual or auditory language stimuli perceived, without prior knowledge of any pre-generated candidates. We compare the language generated from the presented model with a random control, pre-generated language selection approach, and a standard LLM, which generates common coherent text solely based on the next word likelihood according to statistical language training data. The proposed model is found to generate language that is more aligned with semantic stimulus in response to which brain input is sampled. Our findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of employing BCIs in direct language generation. "

Specifically, we develop the \"Relevant Evidence Detection Directed Transformer\" (RED-DOT) and explore multiple architectural variants (e.g., single or dual-stage) and mechanisms (e.g., \"guided attention\"). Extensive ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate that RED-DOT achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on the VERITE benchmark by up to 28.5%. Furthermore, our evidence re-ranking and element-wise modality fusion led to RED-DOT achieving competitive and even improved performance on NewsCLIPings+, without the need for numerous evidence or multiple backbone encoders. Finally, our qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed \"guided attention\" module has the potential to enhance the architecture's interpretability.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09948",
        "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm leveraging LLMs for specific tasks by utilizing labeled examples as demonstrations in the precondition prompts. Despite its promising performance, ICL suffers from instability with the choice and arrangement of examples. Additionally, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of ICL. However, existing attacks are either easy to detect, rely on external models, or lack specificity towards ICL. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel transferable attack for ICL, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the targeted response. The proposed LLM hijacking attack leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demonstrations. Extensive experimental results on various tasks and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our LLM hijacking attack, resulting in a distracted attention towards adversarial tokens, consequently leading to the targeted unwanted outputs.

        "abstract": "Contrastive, self-supervised learning (SSL) is used to train a model that predicts cancer type from miRNA, mRNA or RPPA expression data. This model, a pretrained FT-Transformer, is shown to outperform XGBoost and CatBoost, standard benchmarks for tabular data, when labelled samples are scarce but the number of unlabelled samples is high. This is despite the fact that the datasets we use have $\\mathcal{O}(10^{1})$ classes and $\\mathcal{O}(10^{2})-\\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ features. After demonstrating the efficacy of our chosen method of self-supervised pretraining, we investigate SSL for multi-modal models. A late-fusion model is proposed, where each omics is passed through its own sub-network, the outputs of which are averaged and passed to the pretraining or downstream objective function. Multi-modal pretraining is shown to improve predictions from a single omics, and we argue that this is useful for datasets with many unlabelled multi-modal samples, but few labelled unimodal samples. Additionally, we show that pretraining each omics-specific module individually is highly effective. This enables the application of the proposed model in a variety of contexts where a large amount of unlabelled data is available from each omics, but only a few labelled samples. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09993",
        "abstract": "Automatic hate speech detection using deep neural models is hampered by the scarcity of labeled datasets, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this problem, generative AI has been utilized to generate large amounts of synthetic hate speech sequences from available labeled examples, leveraging the generated data in finetuning large pre-trained language models (LLMs). In this chapter, we provide a review of relevant methods, experimental setups and evaluation of this approach. In addition to general LLMs, such as BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT, we apply and evaluate the impact of train set augmentation with generated data using LLMs that have been already adapted for hate detection, including RoBERTa-Toxicity, HateBERT, HateXplain, ToxDect, and ToxiGen. An empirical study corroborates our previous findings, showing that this approach improves hate speech generalization, boosting recall performance across data distributions. In addition, we explore and compare the performance of the finetuned LLMs with zero-shot hate detection using a GPT-3.5 model. Our results demonstrate that while better generalization is achieved using the GPT-3.5 model, it achieves mediocre recall and low precision on most datasets. It is an open question whether the sensitivity of models such as GPT-3.5, and onward, can be improved using similar techniques of text generation. "

        "abstract": "The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is the measure of choice between point clouds. However the computational cost to compute it makes it prohibitive as a training loss, and the standard approach is to use a surrogate such as the Chamfer distance. We propose an attention-based model to compute an accurate approximation of the EMD that can be used as a training loss for generative models. To get the necessary accurate estimation of the gradients we train our model to explicitly compute the matching between point clouds instead of EMD itself. We cast this new objective as the estimation of an attention matrix that approximates the ground truth matching matrix. Experiments show that this model provides an accurate estimate of the EMD and its gradient with a wall clock speed-up of more than two orders of magnitude with respect to the exact Hungarian matching algorithm and one order of magnitude with respect to the standard approximate Sinkhorn algorithm, allowing in particular to train a point cloud VAE with the EMD itself. Extensive evaluation show the remarkable behaviour of this model when operating out-of-distribution, a key requirement for a distance surrogate. Finally, the model generalizes very well to point clouds during inference several times larger than during training. "

        "abstract": "Prompting serves as the major way humans interact with Large Language Models (LLM). Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses \"You are a helpful assistant\" as part of the default system prompt. But is \"a helpful assistant\" the best role for LLMs? In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of how social roles in system prompts affect model performance. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 types of occupations. Through extensive analysis of 3 popular LLMs and 2457 questions, we show that adding interpersonal roles in prompts consistently improves the models' performance over a range of questions. Moreover, while we find that using gender-neutral roles and specifying the role as the audience leads to better performances, predicting which role leads to the best performance remains a challenging task, and that frequency, similarity, and perplexity do not fully explain the effect of social roles on model performances. Our results can help inform the design of system prompts for AI systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Jiaxin-Pei/Prompting-with-Social-Roles. "

        "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image generation models have unlocked vast potential for visual creativity. However, these models struggle with generation of consistent characters, a crucial aspect for numerous real-world applications such as story visualization, game development asset design, advertising, and more. Current methods typically rely on multiple pre-existing images of the target character or involve labor-intensive manual processes. In this work, we propose a fully automated solution for consistent character generation, with the sole input being a text prompt. We introduce an iterative procedure that, at each stage, identifies a coherent set of images sharing a similar identity and extracts a more consistent identity from this set. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that our method strikes a better balance between prompt alignment and identity consistency compared to the baseline methods, and these findings are reinforced by a user study. To conclude, we showcase several practical applications of our approach. Project page is available at https://omriavrahami.com/the-chosen-one "

However, the metal teeth implants could bring annoying metal artifacts during the CBCT imaging process, interfering diagnosis and downstream processing such as tooth segmentation. In this paper, we develop an efficient Transformer to perform metal artifacts reduction (MAR) from dental CBCT images. The proposed MAR Transformer (MARformer) reduces computation complexity in the multihead self-attention by a new Dimension-Reduced Self-Attention (DRSA) module, based on that the CBCT images have globally similar structure. A Patch-wise Perceptive Feed Forward Network (P2FFN) is also proposed to perceive local image information for fine-grained restoration. Experimental results on CBCT images with synthetic and real-world metal artifacts show that our MARformer is efficient and outperforms previous MAR methods and two restoration Transformers. "

However, the automated computerized segmentation of the fetal head, abdomen, and femur from ultrasound images, along with the subsequent measurement of fetal biometrics, remains challenging. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning approach to classify the region into head, abdomen and femur as well as estimate the associated parameters. We were able to achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.08 mm on head circumference, 1.44 mm on abdomen circumference and 1.10 mm on femur length with a classification accuracy of 99.91\\% on a dataset of fetal Ultrasound images. To achieve this, we leverage a weighted joint classification and segmentation loss function to train a U-Net architecture with an added classification head.

However, the agent-based models (ABMs) commonly used for such simulations lack fidelity to human behavior. We propose a new approach to simulating opinion dynamics based on populations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our findings reveal a strong inherent bias in LLM agents towards accurate information, leading to consensus in line with scientific reality. However, this bias limits the simulation of individuals with resistant views on issues like climate change. After inducing confirmation bias through prompt engineering, we observed opinion fragmentation in line with existing agent-based research. These insights highlight the promise and limitations of LLM agents in this domain and suggest a path forward: refining LLMs with real-world discourse to better simulate the evolution of human beliefs.

        "abstract": "In this article we consider the filtering problem associated to partially observed diffusions, with observations following a marked point process. In the model, the data form a point process with observation times that have its intensity driven by a diffusion, with the associated marks also depending upon the diffusion process. We assume that one must resort to time-discretizing the diffusion process and develop particle and multilevel particle filters to recursively approximate the filter. In particular, we prove that our multilevel particle filter can achieve a mean square error (MSE) of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2)$ ($\\epsilon>0$ and arbitrary) with a cost of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5})$ versus using a particle filter which has a cost of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ to achieve the same MSE. We then show how this methodology can be extended to give unbiased (that is with no time-discretization error) estimators of the filter, which are proved to have finite variance and with high-probability have finite cost. Finally, we extend our methodology to the problem of online static-parameter estimation. "

We investigate the score model of a trained SBM through its linear approximations and subspaces spanned by local feature vectors. During diffusion as the noise decreases, the local dimensionality increases and becomes more varied between different sample sequences. Importantly, we find that the learned vector field mixes samples by a non-conservative field within the manifold, although it denoises with normal projections as if there is an energy function in off-manifold directions. At each noise level, the subspace spanned by the local features overlap with an effective density function. These observations suggest that SBMs can flexibly mix samples with the learned score field while carefully maintaining a manifold-like structure of the data distribution. "
