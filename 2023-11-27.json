        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13608",
        "abstract": "A sketch is one of the most intuitive and versatile tools humans use to convey their ideas visually. An animated sketch opens another dimension to the expression of ideas and is widely used by designers for a variety of purposes. Animating sketches is a laborious process, requiring extensive experience and professional design skills. In this work, we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence, \"breathing life into it\"), merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation, which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training, but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance, we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations. Surprisingly, we find that even models that struggle to generate sketch videos on their own can still serve as a useful backbone for animating abstract representations. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13612",
        "abstract": "Over the past year, a large body of multimodal research has emerged around zero-shot evaluation using GPT descriptors. These studies boost the zero-shot accuracy of pretrained VL models with an ensemble of label-specific text generated by GPT. A recent study, WaffleCLIP, demonstrated that similar zero-shot accuracy can be achieved with an ensemble of random descriptors. However, both zero-shot methods are un-trainable and consequently sub-optimal when some few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) training data is available. Inspired by these prior works, we present two more flexible methods called descriptor and word soups, which do not require an LLM at test time and can leverage training data to increase OOD target accuracy. Descriptor soup greedily selects a small set of textual descriptors using generic few-shot training data, then calculates robust class embeddings using the selected descriptors. Word soup greedily assembles a chain of words in a similar manner. Compared to existing few-shot soft prompt tuning methods, word soup requires fewer parameters by construction and less GPU memory, since it does not require backpropagation. Both soups outperform current published few-shot methods, even when combined with SoTA zero-shot methods, on cross-dataset and domain generalization benchmarks. Compared with SoTA prompt and descriptor ensembling methods, such as ProDA and WaffleCLIP, word soup achieves higher OOD accuracy with fewer ensemble members.

Many Transformer-based pose networks have been proposed recently, achieving encouraging progress in improving performance. However, the remarkable performance of pose networks is always accompanied by heavy computation costs and large network scale. In order to deal with this problem, this paper proposes a High-Efficiency Vision Transformer for Human Pose Estimation (HEViTPose). In HEViTPose, a Cascaded Group Spatial Reduction Multi-Head Attention Module (CGSR-MHA) is proposed, which reduces the computational cost through feature grouping and spatial degradation mechanisms, while preserving feature diversity through multiple low-dimensional attention heads. Moreover, a concept of Patch Embedded Overlap Width (PEOW) is defined to help understand the relationship between the amount of overlap and local continuity. By optimising PEOW, our model gains improvements in performance, parameters and GFLOPs. "

The point of this work is to solve the view consistency problem in single image-guided 3D generation by modeling a reasonable geometric structure. For this purpose, we propose to utilize better 3D prior to training the NeRF. More specifically, we train an object-level LoRA for the target object using original image and the rendering output of NeRF. And then we train the LoRA and NeRF using a progressive training strategy. The LoRA and NeRF will boost each other while training. After the progressive training, the LoRA learns the 3D information of the generated object and eventually turns to an object-level 3D prior. In the final stage, we extract the mesh from the trained NeRF and use the trained LoRA to optimize the structure and appearance of the mesh. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Boosting3D learns object-specific 3D prior which is beyond the ability of pre-trained diffusion priors and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single image-to-3d generation task. "

        "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image generators have led to substantial capabilities in image generation. However, the complexity of prompts acts as a bottleneck in the quality of images generated. A particular under-explored facet is the ability of generative models to create high-quality images comprising multiple components given as a prior. In this paper, we propose and validate a metric called Components Inclusion Score (CIS) to evaluate the extent to which a model can correctly generate multiple components. Our results reveal that the evaluated models struggle to incorporate all the visual elements from prompts with multiple components (8.53% drop in CIS per component for all evaluated models). We also identify a significant decline in the quality of the images and context awareness within an image as the number of components increased (15.91% decrease in inception Score and 9.62% increase in Frechet Inception Distance). To remedy this issue, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion V2 on a custom-created test dataset with multiple components, outperforming its vanilla counterpart. To conclude, these findings reveal a critical limitation in existing text-to-image generators, shedding light on the challenge of generating multiple components within a single image using a complex prompt.

Through meticulous examination, we showcase the capability to accurately recover data solely from gradients and rigorously investigate the conditions under which gradient attacks can be executed, providing compelling evidence. Furthermore, we reevaluate the approach of introducing additional noise on gradients as a protective measure against gradient attacks. To address this, we outline a theoretical proof that analyzes the associated privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Additionally, we affirm the convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm under perturbed gradients. The primary objective of this study is to augment the understanding of gradient leakage attack and defense strategies while actively contributing to the development of privacy-preserving techniques specifically tailored for transformer-based models. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with gradient leakage, this research aims to foster advancements in safeguarding sensitive data and upholding privacy in the context of transformer-based models.

While earlier approaches focus on end-to-end learning directly from video pixels, we propose to revisit text-based representations, such as discrete action labels, or free-form video captions, which are interpretable and can be directly consumed by large language models (LLMs). Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularities. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the \"reasoner\", and can flexibly leverage visual embeddings, action labels, and free-form descriptions extracted from videos as its input. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, Next-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era. We perform extensive ablation study and qualitative analysis to support our observations, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks. "

In this article, we assess the capabilities of diffusion models to erase the traces left by forgers and, therefore, deceive forensics methods. Such an approach has been recently introduced for adversarial purification, achieving significant performance. We show that diffusion purification methods are well suited for counter-forensics tasks. Such approaches outperform already existing counter-forensics techniques both in deceiving forensics methods and in preserving the natural look of the purified images.

        "abstract": "Digital humans and, especially, 3D facial avatars have raised a lot of attention in the past years, as they are the backbone of several applications like immersive telepresence in AR or VR. Despite the progress, facial avatars reconstructed from commodity hardware are incomplete and miss out on parts of the side and back of the head, severely limiting the usability of the avatar. This limitation in prior work stems from their requirement of face tracking, which fails for profile and back views. To address this issue, we propose to learn person-specific animatable avatars from images without assuming to have access to precise facial expression tracking. At the core of our method, we leverage a 3D-aware generative model that is trained to reproduce the distribution of facial expressions from the training data. To train this appearance model, we only assume to have a collection of 2D images with the corresponding camera parameters. For controlling the model, we learn a mapping from 3DMM facial expression parameters to the latent space of the generative model. This mapping can be learned by sampling the latent space of the appearance model and reconstructing the facial parameters from a normalized frontal view, where facial expression estimation performs well. With this scheme, we decouple 3D appearance reconstruction and animation control to achieve high fidelity in image synthesis. In a series of experiments, we compare our proposed technique to state-of-the-art monocular methods and show superior quality while not requiring expression tracking of the training data. "

Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%.

Although commonly deployed CNNs are limited in learning long-range semantic information, transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks such as object detection and image classification. We integrate the hierarchical Swin Transformer as the backbone of a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture for local-global semantic feature learning. Using a real-world case study in French Polynesia, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional CNN and attention-based models on pixel-wise classification of shallow reef imagery. "

We improve the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an encoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to our Langevin sampling and test three different objectives for doing so. Finally, to increase robustness to the sampling step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature, we validate a lightweight and easily computable form of preconditioning, inspired by Riemann Manifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. We compare against VAEs by training like-for-like generative models using our technique against those trained with standard reparameterisation-trick-based ELBOs. We observe our method out-performs or matches performance across a number of metrics, including sample quality, while converging in a fraction of the number of SGD training iterations. "

Existing optimization-based methods, which leverage the powerful 2D prior of diffusion models to handle various parametric images, have mainly focused on generation. Unlike generation, editing requires a balance between conforming to the target attribute and preserving the identity of the source content. Recent 2D image editing methods have achieved this balance by leveraging the stochastic latent encoded in the generative process of diffusion models. To extend the editing capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space, we reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS. PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target, enabling the sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired attribute while maintaining the source's identity. We demonstrate that this optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute, but aligning this process with the trajectory of the source's generative process. Extensive editing results in Neural Radiance Fields and Scalable Vector Graphics representations demonstrate that PDS is capable of sampling targets to fulfill the aforementioned balance across various parameter spaces.

However, inverting more general concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that current methods do not handle.

        "abstract": "The presence of adversarial examples poses a significant threat to deep learning models and their applications. Existing defense methods provide certain resilience against adversarial examples, but often suffer from decreased accuracy and generalization performance, making it challenging to achieve a trade-off between robustness and generalization. To address this, our paper interprets the adversarial example problem from the perspective of sample distribution and proposes a defense method based on distribution shift, leveraging the distribution transfer capability of a diffusion model for adversarial defense. The core idea is to exploit the discrepancy between normal and adversarial sample distributions to achieve adversarial defense using a pretrained diffusion model. Specifically, an adversarial sample undergoes a forward diffusion process, moving away from the source distribution, followed by a reverse process guided by the protected model (victim model) output to map it back to the normal distribution. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR10 and ImageNet30 datasets are conducted, comparing with adversarial training and input preprocessing methods. For infinite-norm attacks with 8/255 perturbation, accuracy rates of 78.1% and 83.5% are achieved, respectively. For 2-norm attacks with 128/255 perturbation, accuracy rates are 74.3% and 82.5%. Additional experiments considering perturbation amplitude, diffusion iterations, and adaptive attacks also validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that even when the attacker has knowledge of the defense, the proposed distribution-based method effectively withstands adversarial examples. It fills the gaps of traditional approaches, restoring high-quality original samples and showcasing superior performance in model robustness and generalization. "

Inspired by visual prompt tuning, we use LPM to extract prompts for input images and hidden features at the encoder side and decoder side, respectively, which are fed as additional information into the Swin Transformer layer of a pre-trained transformer-based image compression model to affect the allocation of attention region and the bits, which in turn changes the target compression ratio of the model. To ensure the network is more lightweight, we involves the integration of prompt networks with less convolutional layers. Exhaustive experiments show that compared to methods based on multiple models, which are optimized separately for different target rates, the proposed method arrives at the same performance with 80% savings in parameter storage and 90% savings in datasets. Meanwhile, our model outperforms all current variable bitrate image methods in terms of rate-distortion performance and approaches the state-of-the-art fixed bitrate image compression methods trained from scratch.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13847",
        "abstract": "The explosion of data has resulted in more and more associated text being transmitted along with images. Inspired by from distributed source coding, many works utilize image side information to enhance image compression. However, existing methods generally do not consider using text as side information to enhance perceptual compression of images, even though the benefits of multimodal synergy have been widely demonstrated in research. This begs the following question: How can we effectively transfer text-level semantic dependencies to help image compression, which is only available to the decoder? In this work, we propose a novel deep image compression method with text-guided side information to achieve a better rate-perception-distortion tradeoff. Specifically, we employ the CLIP text encoder and an effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block to fuse the text and image features. This is done by predicting a semantic mask to guide the learned text-adaptive affine transformation at the pixel level. Furthermore, we design a text-conditional generative adversarial networks to improve the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Extensive experiments involving four datasets and ten image quality assessment metrics demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results in terms of rate-perception trade-off and semantic distortion.

As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, large language models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating human-like text may be used in supporting or providing psychological counseling. However, the application of LLMs in the mental health domain raises concerns regarding the accuracy, effectiveness, and reliability of the information provided. This paper investigates the major challenges associated with the development of LLMs for psychological counseling, including model hallucination, interpretability, bias, privacy, and clinical effectiveness. We explore potential solutions to these challenges that are practical and applicable to the current paradigm of AI. From our experience in developing and deploying LLMs for mental health, AI holds a great promise for improving mental health care, if we can carefully navigate and overcome pitfalls of LLMs. "

        "abstract": "Specifying legal requirements for software systems to ensure their compliance with the applicable regulations is a major concern to requirements engineering (RE). Personal data which is collected by an organization is often shared with other organizations to perform certain processing activities. In such cases, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires issuing a data processing agreement (DPA) which regulates the processing and further ensures that personal data remains protected. Violating GDPR can lead to huge fines reaching to billions of Euros. Software systems involving personal data processing must adhere to the legal obligations stipulated in GDPR and outlined in DPAs. Requirements engineers can elicit from DPAs legal requirements for regulating the data processing activities in software systems. Checking the completeness of a DPA according to the GDPR provisions is therefore an essential prerequisite to ensure that the elicited requirements are complete. Analyzing DPAs entirely manually is time consuming and requires adequate legal expertise. In this paper, we propose an automation strategy to address the completeness checking of DPAs against GDPR. Specifically, we pursue ten alternative solutions which are enabled by different technologies, namely traditional machine learning, deep learning, language modeling, and few-shot learning. The goal of our work is to empirically examine how these different technologies fare in the legal domain. We computed F2 score on a set of 30 real DPAs. Our evaluation shows that best-performing solutions yield F2 score of 86.7% and 89.7% are based on pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa language models. Our analysis further shows that other alternative solutions based on deep learning (e.g., BiLSTM) and few-shot learning (e.g., SetFit) can achieve comparable accuracy, yet are more efficient to develop.

The two PDEs are coupled with a stiff system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), representing ionic currents through the cardiac membrane. Developing efficient and scalable preconditioners for the linear systems arising from the discretization of such computationally challenging model is crucial in order to reduce the computational costs required by the numerical simulations of cardiac electrophysiology. In this work, focusing on the Bidomain system as a model problem, we have benchmarked two popular implementations of the Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioner embedded in the PETSc library and we have studied the performance on the calibration of specific parameters. We have conducted our analysis on modern HPC architectures, performing scalability tests on multi-core and multi-GPUs setttings.

Continual learning would allow for incrementally learning new tasks and accumulating knowledge, thus reusing already trained models would be possible. One potentially suitable approach is generative replay, where a copy of a generative model trained on previous tasks produces synthetic data that are interleaved with data from the current task. However, standard generative replay applied to diffusion models results in a catastrophic loss in denoising capabilities. In this paper, we propose generative distillation, an approach that distils the entire reverse process of a diffusion model. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the continual learning performance of generative replay with only a moderate increase in the computational costs. "

Only activations are transmitted between the central cloud and edge devices to ensure data locality. Our core innovation, PrivateLoRA, addresses the challenging communication overhead by exploiting the low rank of residual activations, achieving over 95% communication reduction. Consequently, PrivateLoRA effectively maintains data locality and is extremely resource efficient. Under standard 5G networks, PrivateLoRA achieves throughput over 300% of device-only solutions for 7B models and over 80% of an A100 GPU for 33B models. PrivateLoRA also provides tuning performance comparable to LoRA for advanced personalization.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework (HGCLIP) that effectively combines CLIP with a deeper exploitation of the Hierarchical class structure via Graph representation learning. We explore constructing the class hierarchy into a graph, with its nodes representing the textual or image features of each category. After passing through a graph encoder, the textual features incorporate hierarchical structure information, while the image features emphasize class-aware features derived from prototypes through the attention mechanism.

As timestep increases, the upper bound accumulates previous consistency training losses. Therefore, larger batch sizes are needed to reduce both current and accumulated losses. We propose Adversarial Consistency Training (ACT), which directly minimizes the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between distributions at each timestep using a discriminator. Theoretically, ACT enhances generation quality, and convergence. By incorporating a discriminator into the consistency training framework, our method achieves improved FID scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64$\\times$64, retains zero-shot image inpainting capabilities, and uses less than $1/6$ of the original batch size and fewer than $1/2$ of the model parameters and training steps compared to the baseline method, this leads to a substantial reduction in resource consumption.

We propose an alternative interpretation which centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a density estimation problem. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution. Finally, we discuss and present findings on \"annotator misspecification\" -- failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator behavior, resulting in poorly-adapted models -- suggesting that approaches that learn from pairwise human preferences could have trouble learning from a population of annotators with diverse viewpoints.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14169",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in language models have showcased human-comparable performance in academic entrance exams. However, existing studies often overlook questions that require the integration of visual comprehension, thus compromising the full spectrum and complexity inherent in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive framework to evaluate language models on entrance exams, which incorporates both textual and visual elements. We evaluate the two most recent editions of Exame Nacional do Ensino M\\'edio (ENEM), the main standardized entrance examination adopted by Brazilian universities. Our study not only reaffirms the capabilities of GPT-4 as the state of the art for handling complex multidisciplinary questions, but also pioneers in offering a realistic assessment of multimodal language models on Portuguese examinations. One of the highlights is that text captions transcribing visual content outperform the direct use of images, suggesting that the vision model has room for improvement. Yet, despite improvements afforded by images or captions, mathematical questions remain a challenge for these state-of-the-art models. The code and data used on experiments are available at https://github.com/piresramon/gpt-4-enem. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14189",
        "abstract": "Reconstructing hand-held objects from a single RGB image without known 3D object templates, category prior, or depth information is a vital yet challenging problem in computer vision. In contrast to prior works that utilize deterministic modeling paradigms, which make it hard to account for the uncertainties introduced by hand- and self-occlusion, we employ a probabilistic point cloud denoising diffusion model to tackle the above challenge. In this work, we present Hand-Aware Conditional Diffusion for monocular hand-held object reconstruction (HACD), modeling the hand-object interaction in two aspects. First, we introduce hand-aware conditioning to model hand-object interaction from both semantic and geometric perspectives. Specifically, a unified hand-object semantic embedding compensates for the 2D local feature deficiency induced by hand occlusion, and a hand articulation embedding further encodes the relationship between object vertices and hand joints. Second, we propose a hand-constrained centroid fixing scheme, which utilizes hand vertices priors to restrict the centroid deviation of partially denoised point cloud during diffusion and reverse process. Removing the centroid bias interference allows the diffusion models to focus on the reconstruction of shape, thus enhancing the stability and precision of local feature projection. Experiments on the synthetic ObMan dataset and two real-world datasets, HO3D and MOW, demonstrate our approach surpasses all existing methods by a large margin. "

        "abstract": "Explicit feature-grid based NeRF models have shown promising results in terms of rendering quality and significant speed-up in training. However, these methods often require a significant amount of data to represent a single scene or object. In this work, we present a compression model that aims to minimize the entropy in the frequency domain in order to effectively reduce the data size. First, we propose using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the tensorial radiance fields to compress the feature-grid. This feature-grid is transformed into coefficients, which are then quantized and entropy encoded, following a similar approach to the traditional video coding pipeline. Furthermore, to achieve a higher level of sparsity, we propose using an entropy parameterization technique for the frequency domain, specifically for DCT coefficients of the feature-grid. Since the transformed coefficients are optimized during the training phase, the proposed model does not require any fine-tuning or additional information. Our model only requires a lightweight compression pipeline for encoding and decoding, making it easier to apply volumetric radiance field methods for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed frequency domain entropy model can achieve superior compression performance across various datasets. The source code will be made publicly available. "

        "abstract": "In the domain of 3D Human Pose Estimation, which finds widespread daily applications, the requirement for convenient acquisition equipment continues to grow. To satisfy this demand, we set our sights on a short-baseline binocular setting that offers both portability and a geometric measurement property that radically mitigates depth ambiguity. However, as the binocular baseline shortens, two serious challenges emerge: first, the robustness of 3D reconstruction against 2D errors deteriorates; and second, occlusion reoccurs due to the limited visual differences between two views. To address the first challenge, we propose the Stereo Co-Keypoints Estimation module to improve the view consistency of 2D keypoints and enhance the 3D robustness. In this module, the disparity is utilized to represent the correspondence of binocular 2D points and the Stereo Volume Feature is introduced to contain binocular features across different disparities. Through the regression of SVF, two-view 2D keypoints are simultaneously estimated in a collaborative way which restricts their view consistency. Furthermore, to deal with occlusions, a Pre-trained Pose Transformer module is introduced. Through this module, 3D poses are refined by perceiving pose coherence, a representation of joint correlations. This perception is injected by the Pose Transformer network and learned through a pre-training task that recovers iterative masked joints. Comprehensive experiments carried out on H36M and MHAD datasets, complemented by visualizations, validate the effectiveness of our approach in the short-baseline binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation and occlusion handling.

        "abstract": "Image super-resolution (SR) methods typically model degradation to improve reconstruction accuracy in complex and unknown degradation scenarios. However, extracting degradation information from low-resolution images is challenging, which limits the model performance. To boost image SR performance, one feasible approach is to introduce additional priors. Inspired by advancements in multi-modal methods and text prompt image processing, we introduce text prompts to image SR to provide degradation priors. Specifically, we first design a text-image generation pipeline to integrate text into SR dataset through the text degradation representation and degradation model. The text representation applies a discretization manner based on the binning method to describe the degradation abstractly. This representation method can also maintain the flexibility of language. Meanwhile, we propose the PromptSR to realize the text prompt SR. The PromptSR employs the diffusion model and the pre-trained language model (e.g., T5 and CLIP). We train the model on the generated text-image dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that introducing text prompts into image SR, yields excellent results on both synthetic and real-world images.

However, given a long paragraph (up to 512 words), these generation models still struggle to achieve strong alignment and are unable to generate images depicting complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively. The code and dataset will be released to foster community research on long-text alignment. "

Additionally, the efficiency of generating videos in pixel space is quite low.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by disentangling the target RGB pixels into two distinct components: spatial content and temporal motions. Specifically, we predict temporal motions which include motion vector and residual based on a 3D-UNet diffusion model. By explicitly modeling temporal motions and warping them to the starting image, we improve the temporal consistency of generated videos. This results in a reduction of spatial redundancy, emphasizing temporal details. Our proposed method achieves performance improvements by disentangling content and motion, all without introducing new structural complexities to the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets confirm our approach's superior performance over the majority of state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. "

Previous applications of the boundary element method to diffusion curves have relied on polygonal approximations, which either forfeit the high-order smoothness of B\\'ezier curves, or, when the polygonal approximation is extremely detailed, result in large and costly systems of equations that must be solved. In this paper, we utilize the boundary integral equation method to accurately and efficiently solve the underlying partial differential equation. Given a desired resolution and viewport, we then interpolate this solution and use the boundary element method to render it. We couple this hybrid approach with the fast multipole method on a non-uniform quadtree for efficient computation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive strategy to enable truly scalable infinite-resolution diffusion curves. "

More precisely, assuming H\\\"older regularity only on the initial condition, we prove convergence of the scheme, space-time H\\\"older regularity of the solution depending on the fractional orders of the operators, as well as specific blow up rates of the first time derivative. Finally, using the obtained regularity results, we are able to prove orders of convergence of the scheme in some cases. These results are consistent with previous studies. The schemes' performance is further numerically verified using both constructed exact solutions and realistic examples. Our experiments show that multithreaded implementation yields an efficient method to solve nonlocal equations numerically. "

Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks). "

However, the decoupling of uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) in FD-RAN makes the existing feedback mechanism ineffective. To this end, we propose an end-to-end data-driven MIMO solution without the conventional channel feedback procedure. Data-driven MIMO can alleviate the drawbacks of feedback including overheads and delay, and can provide customized precoding design for different BSs based on their historical channel data. It essentially learns a mapping from geolocation to MIMO transmission parameters. We first present a codebook-based approach, which selects transmission parameters from the statistics of discrete channel state information (CSI) values and utilizes integer interpolation for spatial inference. We further present a non-codebook-based approach, which 1) derives the optimal precoder from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel; 2) utilizes variational autoencoder (VAE) to select the representative precoder from the latent Gaussian representations; and 3) exploits Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict unknown precoders in the space domain. Extensive simulations are performed on a link-level 5G simulator using realistic ray-tracing channel data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven MIMO, showcasing its potential for application in FD-RAN and 6G. "

The objective of spatiotemporal imputation is to estimate these missing values by understanding the inherent spatial and temporal relationships in the observed multivariate time series. Traditionally, spatiotemporal imputation has relied on specific, intricate architectures designed for this purpose, which suffer from limited applicability and high computational complexity. In contrast, our approach integrates pre-trained large language models (LLMs) into spatiotemporal imputation, introducing a groundbreaking framework, GATGPT. This framework merges a graph attention mechanism with LLMs. We maintain most of the LLM parameters unchanged to leverage existing knowledge for learning temporal patterns, while fine-tuning the upper layers tailored to various applications. The graph attention component enhances the LLM's ability to understand spatial relationships. Through tests on three distinct real-world datasets, our innovative approach demonstrates comparable results to established deep learning benchmarks. "

In this paper, for the first time, we investigate how to search in a training-free manner with the help of teacher models and devise an effective Training-free ViT (TVT) search framework. Firstly, we observe that the similarity of attention maps between ViT and ConvNet teachers affects distill accuracy notably.

Such information sharing ensures that a consensus, in terms of the overall structure and color distribution, among frames can be reached in the early stage of the denoising process before it is too late. The optical flow from the original video serves as the connection, and hence the venue for information sharing, among frames.

Using model arithmetic, we can express prior CTG techniques as simple formulas and naturally extend them to new and more effective formulations. Further, we show that speculative sampling, a technique for efficient LLM sampling, extends to our setting. This enables highly efficient text generation with multiple composed models with only marginal overhead over a single model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that model arithmetic allows fine-grained control of generated text while outperforming state-of-the-art on the task of toxicity reduction. "

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) continue to demonstrate their utility in a variety of emergent capabilities in different fields. An area that could benefit from effective language understanding in cybersecurity is the analysis of log files. This work explores LLMs with different architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-Neo) that are benchmarked for their capacity to better analyze application and system log files for security. Specifically, 60 fine-tuned language models for log analysis are deployed and benchmarked. The resulting models demonstrate that they can be used to perform log analysis effectively with fine-tuning being particularly important for appropriate domain adaptation to specific log types. The best-performing fine-tuned sequence classification model (DistilRoBERTa) outperforms the current state-of-the-art; with an average F1-Score of 0.998 across six datasets from both web application and system log sources. To achieve this, we propose and implement a new experimentation pipeline (LLM4Sec) which leverages LLMs for log analysis experimentation, evaluation, and analysis. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14521",
        "abstract": "3D editing plays a crucial role in many areas such as gaming and virtual reality. Traditional 3D editing methods, which rely on representations like meshes and point clouds, often fall short in realistically depicting complex scenes. On the other hand, methods based on implicit 3D representations, like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), render complex scenes effectively but suffer from slow processing speeds and limited control over specific scene areas. In response to these challenges, our paper presents GaussianEditor, an innovative and efficient 3D editing algorithm based on Gaussian Splatting (GS), a novel 3D representation. GaussianEditor enhances precision and control in editing through our proposed Gaussian semantic tracing, which traces the editing target throughout the training process. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian splatting (HGS) to achieve stabilized and fine results under stochastic generative guidance from 2D diffusion models. We also develop editing strategies for efficient object removal and integration, a challenging task for existing methods. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate GaussianEditor's superior control, efficacy, and rapid performance, marking a significant advancement in 3D editing.

In this work, we explore various methods to improve Ge'ez MT, including transfer-learning from related languages, optimizing shared vocabulary and token segmentation approaches, finetuning large pre-trained models, and using large language models (LLMs) for few-shot translation with fuzzy matches. We develop a multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) model based on languages relatedness, which brings an average performance improvement of about 4 BLEU compared to standard bilingual models. We also attempt to finetune the NLLB-200 model, one of the most advanced translation models available today, but find that it performs poorly with only 4k training samples for Ge'ez. Furthermore, we experiment with using GPT-3.5, a state-of-the-art LLM, for few-shot translation with fuzzy matches, which leverages embedding similarity-based retrieval to find context examples from a parallel corpus. We observe that GPT-3.5 achieves a remarkable BLEU score of 9.2 with no initial knowledge of Ge'ez, but still lower than the MNMT baseline of 15.2. Our work provides insights into the potential and limitations of different approaches for low-resource and ancient language MT. "

Each stage is meticulously formulated for efficiency and accuracy, surpassing Stable-Diffusion (LDM). Extensive experiments on datasets like LSUN-Churches and COCO validate our approach, consistently outperforming existing methods. ToddlerDiffusion achieves notable efficiency, matching LDM performance on LSUN-Churches while operating three times faster with a 3.76 times smaller architecture.

        "abstract": "Learning from human feedback is a prominent technique to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human expectations. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preference signals that are in the form of ranking of response pairs to perform this alignment. However, human preference on LLM outputs can come in much richer forms including natural language, which may provide detailed feedback on strengths and weaknesses of a given response. In this work we investigate data efficiency of modeling human feedback that is in natural language. Specifically, we fine-tune an open-source LLM, e.g., Falcon-40B-Instruct, on a relatively small amount (1000 records or even less) of human feedback in natural language in the form of critiques and revisions of responses. We show that this model is able to improve the quality of responses from even some of the strongest LLMs such as ChatGPT, BARD, and Vicuna, through critique and revision of those responses. For instance, through one iteration of revision of ChatGPT responses, the revised responses have 56.6% win rate over the original ones, and this win rate can be further improved to 65.9% after applying the revision for five iterations.

Recent works add text as an extra modality to enhance the performance of these models. Most of these approaches treat text as an auxiliary modality without fully exploring its potential to elucidate the underlying class visual features distribution. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages text-derived statistics to predict the mean and covariance of the visual feature distribution for each class. This predictive framework enriches the latent space, yielding more robust and generalizable few-shot learning models. We demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both mean and covariance statistics in improving few-shot classification performance across various datasets. Our method shows that we can use text to predict the mean and covariance of the distribution offering promising improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. "

However, existing evaluation benchmarks, primarily relying on rigid, hand-crafted datasets to measure task-specific performance, face significant limitations in assessing the alignment of these increasingly anthropomorphic models with human intelligence. In this work, we address the limitations via Auto-Bench, which delves into exploring LLMs as proficient aligners, measuring the alignment between VLMs and human intelligence and value through automatic data curation and assessment. Specifically, for data curation, Auto-Bench utilizes LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to automatically generate a vast set of question-answer-reasoning triplets via prompting on visual symbolic representations (e.g., captions, object locations, instance relationships, and etc.). The curated data closely matches human intent, owing to the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs. Through this pipeline, a total of 28.5K human-verified and 3,504K unfiltered question-answer-reasoning triplets have been curated, covering 4 primary abilities and 16 sub-abilities. We subsequently engage LLMs like GPT-3.5 to serve as judges, implementing the quantitative and qualitative automated assessments to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs. Our validation results reveal that LLMs are proficient in both evaluation data curation and model assessment, achieving an average agreement rate of 85%. We envision Auto-Bench as a flexible, scalable, and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the evolving sophisticated VLMs. "

        "abstract": "The importance of systems that can extract structured information from textual data becomes increasingly pronounced given the ever-increasing volume of text produced on a daily basis. Having a system that can effectively extract such information in an interoperable manner would be an asset for several domains, be it finance, health, or legal. Recent developments in natural language processing led to the production of powerful language models that can, to some degree, mimic human intelligence. Such effectiveness raises a pertinent question: Can these models be leveraged for the extraction of structured information? In this work, we address this question by evaluating the capabilities of two state-of-the-art language models -- GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, commonly known as ChatGPT -- in the extraction of narrative entities, namely events, participants, and temporal expressions. This study is conducted on the Text2Story Lusa dataset, a collection of 119 Portuguese news articles whose annotation framework includes a set of entity structures along with several tags and attribute values. We first select the best prompt template through an ablation study over prompt components that provide varying degrees of information on a subset of documents of the dataset. Subsequently, we use the best templates to evaluate the effectiveness of the models on the remaining documents. The results obtained indicate that GPT models are competitive with out-of-the-box baseline systems, presenting an all-in-one alternative for practitioners with limited resources. By studying the strengths and limitations of these models in the context of information extraction, we offer insights that can guide future improvements and avenues to explore in this field. "

Our 4D generation leverages an advanced 4D grid dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model, optimized in three distinct stages using multiple diffusion priors. Initially, a static model is optimized using the reference image, guided by 2D and 3D diffusion priors, which serves as the initialization for the dynamic NeRF. Subsequently, a video diffusion model is employed to learn the motion specific to the subject. However, the object in the 3D videos tends to drift away from the reference image over time. This drift is mainly due to the misalignment between the text prompt and the reference image in the video diffusion model. In the final stage, a personalized diffusion prior is therefore utilized to address the semantic drift. As the pioneering image-text-to-4D generation framework, our method demonstrates significant advancements over existing baselines, evidenced by comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments.

An optimization-based technique utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to accurately estimate the cumulative number of molecules received. This technique yields nearly constant correction parameters and demonstrates a significant improvement of 5 times in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). The estimated channel model provides an approximate analytical impulse response; hence, it is used for estimating channel parameters such as distance, diffusion coefficient, or a combination of both. We apply iterative maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the parameter estimation, which gives consistent errors compared to the estimated Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CLRB). "

Subsequently, users can utilize text prompts to generate images that embody the personalized concept, thereby achieving text-to-image personalization. In contrast to existing approaches that emphasize word embedding learning or parameter fine-tuning for the diffusion model, which potentially causes concept dilution or overfitting, our method concatenates embeddings on the feature-dense space of the text encoder in the diffusion model to learn the gap between the personalized concept and its base class, aiming to maximize the preservation of prior knowledge in diffusion models while restoring the personalized concepts. To this end, we first dissect the text encoder's integration in the image generation process to identify the feature-dense space of the encoder. Afterward, we concatenate embeddings on the Keys and Values in this space to learn the gap between the personalized concept and its base class. In this way, the concatenated embeddings ultimately manifest as a residual on the original attention output. To more accurately and unbiasedly quantify the results of personalized image generation, we improve the CLIP image alignment score based on masks. Qualitatively and quantitatively, CatVersion helps to restore personalization concepts more faithfully and enables more robust editing. "

For \"arbitrary\" facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data, we show that hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition appropriate for generative language models. Specifically, if the maximum probability of any fact is bounded, we show that the probability of generating a hallucination is close to the fraction of facts that occur exactly once in the training data (a \"Good-Turing\" estimate), even assuming ideal training data without errors.

        "abstract": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications that involve long contexts, particularly for extended dialogues and text analysis, is of paramount importance but presents two significant challenges. Firstly, the memory consumption is substantial during the decoding phase due to the caching of Key and Value states (KV) of previous tokens. Secondly, attention computation is time-consuming with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for the generation of each token. In recent OpenAI DevDay (Nov 6, 2023), OpenAI released a new model that is able to support a 128K-long document, in our paper, we focus on the memory-efficient issue when context length $n$ is much greater than 128K ($n \\gg 2^d$). Considering a single-layer self-attention with Query, Key, and Value matrices $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, the polynomial method approximates the attention output $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. It accomplishes this by constructing $U_1, U_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times t}$ to expedite attention ${\\sf Attn}(Q, K, V)$ computation within $n^{1+o(1)}$ time executions. Despite this, storing the Key and Value matrices $K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ still necessitates $O( n d)$ space, leading to significant memory usage. In response to these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm that only reads one pass of the data in streaming fashion. This method employs sublinear space $o(n)$ to store three sketch matrices, alleviating the need for exact $K, V$ storage. Notably, our algorithm exhibits exceptional memory-efficient performance with super-long tokens. As the token length $n$ increases, our error guarantee diminishes while the memory usage remains nearly constant. This unique attribute underscores the potential of our technique in efficiently handling LLMs in streaming applications. "

To aid radiologists detect these subtle fractures, we need to develop a model that can flag abnormal distal tibial radiographs (i.e. those with CMLs). Unfortunately, the development of such a model requires a large and diverse training database, which is often not available. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative model for data augmentation. Unlike previous models that fail to generate data that span the diverse radiographic appearance of the distal tibial CML, our proposed masked conditional diffusion model (MaC-DM) not only generates realistic-appearing and wide-ranging synthetic images of the distal tibial radiographs with and without CMLs, it also generates their associated segmentation labels. To achieve these tasks, MaC-DM combines the weighted segmentation masks of the tibias and the CML fracture sites as additional conditions for classifier guidance. The augmented images from our model improved the performances of ResNet-34 in classifying normal radiographs and those with CMLs. Further, the augmented images and their associated segmentation masks enhanced the performance of the U-Net in labeling areas of the CMLs on distal tibial radiographs. "

Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare \\textsc{FinMe} with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks and funds. We then fine-tuned the agent's perceptual spans to achieve a significant trading performance.

In this paper, we consider the semantic communication (SemCom) system with multiple users, where there is a limited number of training samples and unexpected interference. To improve the model generalization ability and reduce the model size, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) based system where Transformer based encoder-decoder is implemented as the semantic encoder-decoder and fully connected neural networks are implemented as the channel encoder-decoder. Specifically, four types of knowledge transfer and model compression are analyzed. Important system and model parameters are considered, including the level of noise and interference, the number of interfering users and the size of the encoder and decoder. Numerical results demonstrate that KD significantly improves the robustness and the generalization ability when applied to unexpected interference, and it reduces the performance loss when compressing the model size.

This allows us to rigorously study the steady states of this crossdiffusion system much more extensively than what previously possible with purely pen-and-paper techniques. Our computer-assisted argument makes use of Fourier series decomposition, which is common in the literature, but usually restricted to systems with polynomial nonlinearities.
