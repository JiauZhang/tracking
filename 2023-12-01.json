        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17937",
        "abstract": "We propose CompFuser, an image generation pipeline that enhances spatial comprehension and attribute assignment in text-to-image generative models. Our pipeline enables the interpretation of instructions defining spatial relationships between objects in a scene, such as `An image of a gray cat on the left of an orange dog', and generate corresponding images. This is especially important in order to provide more control to the user. CompFuser overcomes the limitation of existing text-to-image diffusion models by decoding the generation of multiple objects into iterative steps: first generating a single object and then editing the image by placing additional objects in their designated positions. To create training data for spatial comprehension and attribute assignment we introduce a synthetic data generation process, that leverages a frozen large language model and a frozen layout-based diffusion model for object placement. We compare our approach to strong baselines and show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art image generation models in spatial comprehension and attribute assignment, despite being 3x to 5x smaller in parameters.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17938",
        "abstract": "Active recognition, which allows intelligent agents to explore observations for better recognition performance, serves as a prerequisite for various embodied AI tasks, such as grasping, navigation and room arrangements. Given the evolving environment and the multitude of object classes, it is impractical to include all possible classes during the training stage. In this paper, we aim at advancing active open-vocabulary recognition, empowering embodied agents to actively perceive and classify arbitrary objects. However, directly adopting recent open-vocabulary classification models, like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), poses its unique challenges. Specifically, we observe that CLIP's performance is heavily affected by the viewpoint and occlusions, compromising its reliability in unconstrained embodied perception scenarios. Further, the sequential nature of observations in agent-environment interactions necessitates an effective method for integrating features that maintains discriminative strength for open-vocabulary classification. To address these issues, we introduce a novel agent for active open-vocabulary recognition. The proposed method leverages inter-frame and inter-concept similarities to navigate agent movements and to fuse features, without relying on class-specific knowledge. Compared to baseline CLIP model with 29.6% accuracy on ShapeNet dataset, the proposed agent could achieve 53.3% accuracy for open-vocabulary recognition, without any fine-tuning to the equipped CLIP model. Additional experiments conducted with the Habitat simulator further affirm the efficacy of our method. "

        "abstract": "Handling the ever-increasing scale of contemporary deep learning and transformer-based models poses a significant challenge. Although great strides have been made in optimizing model compression techniques such as model architecture search and knowledge distillation, the availability of data and computational resources remains a considerable hurdle for these optimizations. This paper introduces LayerCollapse, a novel alternative adaptive model compression methodology. LayerCollapse works by eliminating non-linearities within the network and collapsing two consecutive fully connected layers into a single linear transformation. This approach simultaneously reduces both the number of layers and the parameter count, thereby enhancing model efficiency. We also introduce a compression aware regularizer, which compresses the model in alignment with the dataset quality and model expressiveness, consequently reducing overfitting across tasks. Our results demonstrate LayerCollapse's effective compression and regularization capabilities in multiple fine-grained classification benchmarks, achieving up to 74% post training compression with minimal accuracy loss. We compare this method with knowledge distillation on the same target network, showcasing a five-fold increase in computational efficiency and 8% improvement in overall accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17945",
        "abstract": "We study the task of extending the large language model (LLM) into a vision-language instruction-following model. This task is crucial but challenging since the LLM is trained on text modality only, making it hard to effectively digest the visual modality. To address this, existing methods typically train a visual adapter to align the representation between a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) and the LLM by a generative image captioning loss. However, we find that the generative objective can only produce weak alignment for vision and language, making the aligned vision-language model very hungry for the instruction fine-tuning data. In this paper, we propose CG-VLM that applies both Contrastive and Generative alignment objectives to effectively align the representation of ViT and LLM. Different from image level and sentence level alignment in common contrastive learning settings, CG-VLM aligns the image-patch level features and text-token level embeddings, which, however, is very hard to achieve as no explicit grounding patch-token relation provided in standard image captioning datasets. To address this issue, we propose to maximize the averaged similarity between pooled image-patch features and text-token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CG-VLM produces strong vision-language alignment and is an efficient instruction learner. For example, using only 10% instruction tuning data, we reach 95% performance of state-of-the-art method LLaVA [29] on the zero-shot ScienceQA-Image benchmark. "

        "abstract": "Despite their wide-spread success, Text-to-Image models (T2I) still struggle to produce images that are both aesthetically pleasing and faithful to the user's input text. We introduce DreamSync, a model-agnostic training algorithm by design that improves T2I models to be faithful to the text input. DreamSync builds off a recent insight from TIFA's evaluation framework -- that large vision-language models (VLMs) can effectively identify the fine-grained discrepancies between generated images and the text inputs. DreamSync uses this insight to train T2I models without any labeled data; it improves T2I models using its own generations. First, it prompts the model to generate several candidate images for a given input text. Then, it uses two VLMs to select the best generation: a Visual Question Answering model that measures the alignment of generated images to the text, and another that measures the generation's aesthetic quality. After selection, we use LoRA to iteratively finetune the T2I model to guide its generation towards the selected best generations. DreamSync does not need any additional human annotation. model architecture changes, or reinforcement learning. Despite its simplicity, DreamSync improves both the semantic alignment and aesthetic appeal of two diffusion-based T2I models, evidenced by multiple benchmarks (+1.7% on TIFA, +2.9% on DSG1K, +3.4% on VILA aesthetic) and human evaluation.

C3Net adapts the ControlNet architecture to jointly train and make inferences on a production-ready diffusion model and its trainable copies. Specifically, C3Net first aligns the conditions from multi-modalities to the same semantic latent space using modality-specific encoders based on contrastive training. Then, it generates multimodal outputs based on the aligned latent space, whose semantic information is combined using a ControlNet-like architecture called Control C3-UNet. Correspondingly, with this system design, our model offers an improved solution for joint-modality generation through learning and explaining multimodal conditions instead of simply taking linear interpolations on the latent space. Meanwhile, as we align conditions to a unified latent space, C3Net only requires one trainable Control C3-UNet to work on multimodal semantic information. Furthermore, our model employs unimodal pretraining on the condition alignment stage, outperforming the non-pretrained alignment even on relatively scarce training data and thus demonstrating high-quality compound condition generation. We contribute the first high-quality tri-modal validation set to validate quantitatively that C3Net outperforms or is on par with first and contemporary state-of-the-art multimodal generation. Our codes and tri-modal dataset will be released. "

        "abstract": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment target objects expressed in natural language within a scene at the pixel level. Various recent RIS models have achieved state-of-the-art performance by generating contextual tokens to model multimodal features from pretrained encoders and effectively fusing them using transformer-based cross-modal attention. While these methods match language features with image features to effectively identify likely target objects, they often struggle to correctly understand contextual information in complex and ambiguous sentences and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel bidirectional token-masking autoencoder (BTMAE) inspired by the masked autoencoder (MAE). The proposed model learns the context of image-to-language and language-to-image by reconstructing missing features in both image and language features at the token level. In other words, this approach involves mutually complementing across the features of images and language, with a focus on enabling the network to understand interconnected deep contextual information between the two modalities. This learning method enhances the robustness of RIS performance in complex sentences and scenes. Our BTMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular datasets, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through various ablation studies. "

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the field of image search for e-commerce applications. Traditional image-to-image retrieval models, which focus solely on image details such as texture, tend to overlook useful semantic information contained within the images. As a result, the retrieved products might possess similar image details, but fail to fulfil the user's search goals. Moreover, the use of image-to-image retrieval models for products containing multiple images results in significant online product feature storage overhead and complex mapping implementations. In this paper, we report the design and deployment of the proposed Multi-modal Item Embedding Model (MIEM) to address these limitations. It is capable of utilizing both textual information and multiple images about a product to construct meaningful product features. By leveraging semantic information from images, MIEM effectively supplements the image search process, improving the overall accuracy of retrieval results. MIEM has become an integral part of the Shopee image search platform. Since its deployment in March 2023, it has achieved a remarkable 9.90% increase in terms of clicks per user and a 4.23% boost in terms of orders per user for the image search feature on the Shopee e-commerce platform.

Two factors in scene text images, semantic information and visual structure, affect the recognition performance significantly.

Specifically, a diffusion-based module is developed to enhance the text prior, hence offering better guidance for the SR network to generate SR images with higher semantic accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed PEAN leverages an attention-based modulation module to understand scene text images by neatly perceiving the local and global dependence of images, despite the shape of the text. A multi-task learning paradigm is employed to optimize the network, enabling the model to generate legible SR images. As a result, PEAN establishes new SOTA results on the TextZoom benchmark. Experiments are also conducted to analyze the importance of the enhanced text prior as a means of improving the performance of the SR network.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic images but suffer from generating accurate human hands, such as incorrect finger counts or irregular shapes. This difficulty arises from the complex task of learning the physical structure and pose of hands from training images, which involves extensive deformations and occlusions. For correct hand generation, our paper introduces a lightweight post-processing solution called $\\textbf{HandRefiner}$. HandRefiner employs a conditional inpainting approach to rectify malformed hands while leaving other parts of the image untouched. We leverage the hand mesh reconstruction model that consistently adheres to the correct number of fingers and hand shape, while also being capable of fitting the desired hand pose in the generated image. Given a generated failed image due to malformed hands, we utilize ControlNet modules to re-inject such correct hand information. Additionally, we uncover a phase transition phenomenon within ControlNet as we vary the control strength. It enables us to take advantage of more readily available synthetic data without suffering from the domain gap between realistic and synthetic hands. Experiments demonstrate that HandRefiner can significantly improve the generation quality quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/HandRefiner . "

        "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation by distilling pretrained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has shown great promise but still suffers from inconsistent 3D geometric structures (Janus problems) and severe artifacts. The aforementioned problems mainly stem from 2D diffusion models lacking 3D awareness during the lifting. In this work, we present GeoDream, a novel method that incorporates explicit generalized 3D priors with 2D diffusion priors to enhance the capability of obtaining unambiguous 3D consistent geometric structures without sacrificing diversity or fidelity. Specifically, we first utilize a multi-view diffusion model to generate posed images and then construct cost volume from the predicted image, which serves as native 3D geometric priors, ensuring spatial consistency in 3D space. Subsequently, we further propose to harness 3D geometric priors to unlock the great potential of 3D awareness in 2D diffusion priors via a disentangled design. Notably, disentangling 2D and 3D priors allows us to refine 3D geometric priors further. We justify that the refined 3D geometric priors aid in the 3D-aware capability of 2D diffusion priors, which in turn provides superior guidance for the refinement of 3D geometric priors. Our numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate that GeoDream generates more 3D consistent textured meshes with high-resolution realistic renderings (i.e., 1024 $\\times$ 1024) and adheres more closely to semantic coherence.

However, vision transformers still struggle with geometric variations prevalent in video data. This paper proposes a novel approach, GeoDeformer, designed to capture the variations inherent in action video by integrating geometric comprehension directly into the ViT architecture. Specifically, at the core of GeoDeformer is the Geometric Deformation Predictor, a module designed to identify and quantify potential spatial and temporal geometric deformations within the given video. Spatial deformations adjust the geometry within individual frames, while temporal deformations capture the cross-frame geometric dynamics, reflecting motion and temporal progression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we incorporate it into the established MViTv2 framework, replacing the standard self-attention blocks with GeoDeformer blocks. Our experiments at UCF101, HMDB51, and Mini-K200 achieve significant increases in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results with only a marginal increase in computational cost.

The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate normal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians.

Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting in PSNR on specular object datasets, exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB.

        "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for various vision tasks. One reason behind the success lies in their ability to provide plausible innate explanations for the behavior of neural architectures. However, ViTs suffer from issues with explanation faithfulness, as their focal points are fragile to adversarial attacks and can be easily changed with even slight perturbations on the input image. In this paper, we propose a rigorous approach to mitigate these issues by introducing Faithful ViTs (FViTs). Briefly speaking, an FViT should have the following two properties: (1) The top-$k$ indices of its self-attention vector should remain mostly unchanged under input perturbation, indicating stable explanations; (2) The prediction distribution should be robust to perturbations. To achieve this, we propose a new method called Denoised Diffusion Smoothing (DDS), which adopts randomized smoothing and diffusion-based denoising. We theoretically prove that processing ViTs directly with DDS can turn them into FViTs. We also show that Gaussian noise is nearly optimal for both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$-norm cases. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments and evaluations. Specifically, we compare our FViTs with other baselines through visual interpretation and robustness accuracy under adversarial attacks. Results show that FViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks while maintaining the explainability of attention, indicating higher faithfulness. "

However, current text-to-4D methods face a three-way tradeoff between the quality of scene appearance, 3D structure, and motion. For example, text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure -- but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion, but poorer appearance and 3D structure. While these models have complementary strengths, they also have opposing weaknesses, making it difficult to combine them in a way that alleviates this three-way tradeoff. Here, we introduce hybrid score distillation sampling, an alternating optimization procedure that blends supervision signals from multiple pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates benefits of each for high-fidelity text-to-4D generation. Using hybrid SDS, we demonstrate synthesis of 4D scenes with compelling appearance, 3D structure, and motion. "

The inclusion of additional visual information in the demonstrations motivates the following research questions: which of the two modalities in the demonstration is more significant? How can we select effective multimodal demonstrations to enhance ICL performance? This study investigates the significance of both visual and language information. Our findings indicate that ICL in VLMs is predominantly driven by the textual information in the demonstrations whereas the visual information in the demonstrations barely affects the ICL performance.

Motivated by our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach, termed Mixed Modality In-Context Example Selection (MMICES), which considers both visual and language modalities when selecting demonstrations and shows better ICL performance.

In one case (XLM-RoBERTa), embeddings encode language: tokens in different writing systems can be linearly separated with an average of 99.2% accuracy. Another family (mT5) represents cross-lingual semantic similarity: the 50 nearest neighbors for any token represent an average of 7.61 writing systems, and are frequently translations. This result is surprising given that there is no explicit parallel cross-lingual training corpora and no explicit incentive for translations in pre-training objectives.

        "abstract": "Bias analysis is a crucial step in the process of creating fair datasets for training and evaluating computer vision models. The bottleneck in dataset analysis is annotation, which typically requires: (1) specifying a list of attributes relevant to the dataset domain, and (2) classifying each image-attribute pair. While the second step has made rapid progress in automation, the first has remained human-centered, requiring an experimenter to compile lists of in-domain attributes. However, an experimenter may have limited foresight leading to annotation \"blind spots,\" which in turn can lead to flawed downstream dataset analyses. To combat this, we propose GELDA, a nearly automatic framework that leverages large generative language models (LLMs) to propose and label various attributes for a domain. GELDA takes a user-defined domain caption (e.g., \"a photo of a bird,\" \"a photo of a living room\") and uses an LLM to hierarchically generate attributes. In addition, GELDA uses the LLM to decide which of a set of vision-language models (VLMs) to use to classify each attribute in images. Results on real datasets show that GELDA can generate accurate and diverse visual attribute suggestions, and uncover biases such as confounding between class labels and background features. Results on synthetic datasets demonstrate that GELDA can be used to evaluate the biases of text-to-image diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Overall, we show that while GELDA is not accurate enough to replace human annotators, it can serve as a complementary tool to help humans analyze datasets in a cheap, low-effort, and flexible manner.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18071",
        "abstract": "The goal of test-time adaptation is to adapt a source-pretrained model to a continuously changing target domain without relying on any source data. Typically, this is either done by updating the parameters of the model (model adaptation) using inputs from the target domain or by modifying the inputs themselves (input adaptation). However, methods that modify the model suffer from the issue of compounding noisy updates whereas methods that modify the input need to adapt to every new data point from scratch while also struggling with certain domain shifts. We introduce an approach that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to project the target domain images closer to the source domain and iteratively updates the model via pseudo-label ensembling. Our method combines the advantages of model and input adaptations while mitigating their shortcomings. Our experiments on CIFAR-10C demonstrate the superiority of our approach, outperforming the strongest baseline by an average of 1.7% across 15 diverse corruptions and surpassing the strongest input adaptation baseline by an average of 18%.

        "abstract": "Super-Resolution for remote sensing has the potential for huge impact on planet monitoring by producing accurate and realistic high resolution imagery on a frequent basis and a global scale. Despite a lot of attention, several inconsistencies and challenges have prevented it from being deployed in practice. These include the lack of effective metrics, fragmented and relatively small-scale datasets for training, insufficient comparisons across a suite of methods, and unclear evidence for the use of super-resolution outputs for machine consumption. This work presents a new metric for super-resolution, CLIPScore, that corresponds far better with human judgments than previous metrics on an extensive study. We use CLIPScore to evaluate four standard methods on a new large-scale dataset, S2-NAIP, and three existing benchmark datasets, and find that generative adversarial networks easily outperform more traditional L2 loss-based models and are more semantically accurate than modern diffusion models. We also find that using CLIPScore as an auxiliary loss can speed up the training of GANs by 18x and lead to improved outputs, resulting in an effective model in diverse geographies across the world which we will release publicly. The dataset, pre-trained model weights, and code are available at https://github.com/allenai/satlas-super-resolution/. "

        "abstract": "Due to an alarming trend related to obesity affecting 93.3 million adults in the United States alone, body mass index (BMI) and body weight have drawn significant interest in various health monitoring applications. Consequently, several studies have proposed self-diagnostic facial image-based BMI prediction methods for healthy weight monitoring. These methods have mostly used convolutional neural network (CNN) based regression baselines, such as VGG19, ResNet50, and Efficient-NetB0, for BMI prediction from facial images. However, the high computational requirement of these heavy-weight CNN models limits their deployment to resource-constrained mobile devices, thus deterring weight monitoring using smartphones. This paper aims to develop a lightweight facial patch-based ensemble (PatchBMI-Net) for BMI prediction to facilitate the deployment and weight monitoring using smartphones. Extensive experiments on BMI-annotated facial image datasets suggest that our proposed PatchBMI-Net model can obtain Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the range [3.58, 6.51] with a size of about 3.3 million parameters. On cross-comparison with heavyweight models, such as ResNet-50 and Xception, trained for BMI prediction from facial images, our proposed PatchBMI-Net obtains equivalent MAE along with the model size reduction of about 5.4x and the average inference time reduction of about 3x when deployed on Apple-14 smartphone. Thus, demonstrating performance efficiency as well as low latency for on-device deployment and weight monitoring using smartphone applications. "

Using this computational method, we propose a policy for the original (pre-limit) call center scheduling problem. Finally, the performance of this policy is assessed using test problems based on publicly available call center data. For the test problems considered so far, our policy does as well as the best benchmark we could find. Moreover, our method is computationally feasible at least up to dimension 100, that is, for call centers with 100 or more distinct customer classes. "

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation, but their real-world applications are hampered by the extensive time needed for hundreds of diffusion steps. Although progressive distillation has been proposed to speed up diffusion sampling to 2-8 steps, it still falls short in one-step generation, and necessitates training multiple student models, which is highly parameter-extensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce High-frequency-Promoting Adaptation (HiPA), a parameter-efficient approach to enable one-step text-to-image diffusion. Grounded in the insight that high-frequency information is essential but highly lacking in one-step diffusion, HiPA focuses on training one-step, low-rank adaptors to specifically enhance the under-represented high-frequency abilities of advanced diffusion models. The learned adaptors empower these diffusion models to generate high-quality images in just a single step. Compared with progressive distillation, HiPA achieves much better performance in one-step text-to-image generation (37.3 $\\rightarrow$ 23.8 in FID-5k on MS-COCO 2017) and 28.6x training speed-up (108.8 $\\rightarrow$ 3.8 A100 GPU days), requiring only 0.04% training parameters (7,740 million $\\rightarrow$ 3.3 million). We also demonstrate HiPA's effectiveness in text-guided image editing, inpainting and super-resolution tasks, where our adapted models consistently deliver high-quality outputs in just one diffusion step. The source code will be released. "

However, it comes with a drawback in the much larger storage demand compared to NeRF methods since it needs to store the parameters for several 3D Gaussians. We notice that many Gaussians may share similar parameters, so we introduce a simple vector quantization method based on \\kmeans algorithm to quantize the Gaussian parameters. Then, we store the small codebook along with the index of the code for each Gaussian. Moreover, we compress the indices further by sorting them and using a method similar to run-length encoding. We do extensive experiments on standard benchmarks as well as a new benchmark which is an order of magnitude larger than the standard benchmarks. We show that our simple yet effective method can reduce the storage cost for the original 3D Gaussian Splatting method by a factor of almost $20\\times$ with a very small drop in the quality of rendered images.

However, this can easily result in overfitting. In other words, they manage to adapt the style but fail to preserve the content, where \\textit{style} denotes the specific properties that defines a domain while \\textit{content} denotes the domain-irrelevant information that represents diversity. Recent works try to maintain a pre-defined correspondence to preserve the content, however, the diversity is still not enough and it may affect style adaptation. In this work, we propose a paired image reconstruction approach for content preservation. We propose to introduce an image translation module to GAN transferring, where the module teaches the generator to separate style and content, and the generator provides training data to the translation module in return. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in few shot setting. "

Despite the impressive ICL ability of LLMs, it has also been found that ICL in LLMs is sensitive to input demonstrations and limited to short context lengths. To understand the limitations and principles for successful ICL, we conduct an investigation with ICL linear regression of transformers. We characterize several Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases for ICL inspired by realistic LLM ICL failures and compare transformers with DeepSet, a simple yet powerful architecture for ICL. Surprisingly, DeepSet outperforms transformers across a variety of distribution shifts, implying that preserving permutation invariance symmetry to input demonstrations is crucial for OOD ICL. The phenomenon specifies a fundamental requirement by ICL, which we termed as ICL invariance. Nevertheless, the positional encodings in LLMs will break ICL invariance. To this end, we further evaluate transformers with identical positional encodings and find preserving ICL invariance in transformers achieves state-of-the-art performance across various ICL distribution shifts "

        "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of subsets with positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data manifold. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a valid solution to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences, we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11, on par with the performance of one-step consistency model.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) provide excellent text-generation capabilities, but standard prompting and generation methods generally do not lead to intentional or goal-directed agents and might necessitate considerable prompt tuning. This becomes particularly apparent in multi-turn conversations: even the best current LLMs rarely ask clarifying questions, engage in explicit information gathering, or take actions now that lead to better decisions after multiple turns. Reinforcement learning has the potential to leverage the powerful modeling capabilities of LLMs, as well as their internal representation of textual interactions, to create capable goal-directed language agents. This can enable intentional and temporally extended interactions, such as with humans, through coordinated persuasion and carefully crafted questions, or in goal-directed play through text games to bring about desired final outcomes. However, enabling this requires the community to develop stable and reliable reinforcement learning algorithms that can effectively train LLMs. Developing such algorithms requires tasks that can gauge progress on algorithm design, provide accessible and reproducible evaluations for multi-turn interactions, and cover a range of task properties and challenges in improving reinforcement learning algorithms. Our paper introduces the LMRL-Gym benchmark for evaluating multi-turn RL for LLMs, together with an open-source research framework containing a basic toolkit for getting started on multi-turn RL with offline value-based and policy-based RL methods. Our benchmark consists of 8 different language tasks, which require multiple rounds of language interaction and cover a range of tasks in open-ended dialogue and text games. "

In this work, we answer this question by proposing a simple and highly effective task-oriented knowledge transfer approach to leverage pretrained VFMs for effective training of small task-specific models. Our experimental results on four target tasks under limited labeled data settings show that the proposed knowledge transfer approach outperforms task-agnostic VFM distillation, web-scale CLIP pretraining and supervised ImageNet pretraining by 1-10.5%, 2-22% and 2-14%, respectively.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered a practical solution for endowing chatbots with anthropomorphic language capabilities. However, it takes more than LLMs to enable chatbots that can act as companions. Humans use their understanding of individual personalities to drive conversations. Chatbots also require this capability to enable human-like companionship. They should act based on personalized, real-time, and time-evolving knowledge of their owner. We define such essential knowledge as the \\textit{common ground} between chatbots and their owners, and we propose to build a common-ground-aware dialogue system from an LLM-based module, named \\textit{OS-1}, to enable chatbot companionship. Hosted by eyewear, OS-1 can sense the visual and audio signals the user receives and extract real-time contextual semantics. Those semantics are categorized and recorded to formulate historical contexts from which the user's profile is distilled and evolves over time, i.e., OS-1 gradually learns about its user. OS-1 combines knowledge from real-time semantics, historical contexts, and user-specific profiles to produce a common-ground-aware prompt input into the LLM module. The LLM's output is converted to audio, spoken to the wearer when appropriate.We conduct laboratory and in-field studies to assess OS-1's ability to build common ground between the chatbot and its user. The technical feasibility and capabilities of the system are also evaluated. OS-1, with its common-ground awareness, can significantly improve user satisfaction and potentially lead to downstream tasks such as personal emotional support and assistance. "

This approach effectively handles higher resolutions without resorting to global compression, thus preserving detailed image representation throughout the diffusion process. Our focus on FLOP-efficient architectures in diffusion training marks a significant step forward. Comprehensive evaluations on both ImageNet and LSUN datasets at two resolutions demonstrate that DiffuSSMs are on par or even outperform existing diffusion models with attention modules in FID and Inception Score metrics while significantly reducing total FLOP usage.

        "abstract": "Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success, as replaying the exemplars of old classes can significantly mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restrictions of CIL result in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity, leading to data imbalance and overfitting issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel exemplar super-compression and regeneration method, ESCORT, which substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars. Rather than storing past images, we compress images into visual and textual prompts, e.g., edge maps and class tags, and save the prompts instead, reducing the memory usage of each exemplar to 1/24 of the original size. In subsequent learning phases, diverse high-resolution exemplars are generated from the prompts by a pre-trained diffusion model, e.g., ControlNet. To minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images, we propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation, allowing us to utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model without fine-tuning it on the target dataset. Therefore, the same diffusion model can be downloaded whenever it is needed, incurring no memory consumption. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves model performance across multiple CIL benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 percentage points higher than the previous state-of-the-art on 10-phase Caltech-256 dataset.

We alternate between editing the video frames' dataset and updating the underlying 3D portrait until the edited frames reach 3D consistency.

Recently, Last Layer Retraining (LLR) with group-balanced datasets is known to be efficient in mitigating the spurious correlation of classifiers. However, the acquisition of group-balanced datasets is costly, which hinders the applicability of the LLR method. In this work, we propose to perform LLR based on text datasets built with large language models for a general image classifier. We demonstrate that text can be a proxy for its corresponding image beyond the image-text joint embedding space, such as CLIP. Based on this, we use generated texts to train the final layer in the embedding space of the arbitrary image classifier. In addition, we propose a method of filtering the generated words to get rid of noisy, imprecise words, which reduces the effort of inspecting each word. We dub these procedures as TLDR (\\textbf{T}ext-based \\textbf{L}ast layer retraining for \\textbf{D}ebiasing image classifie\\textbf{R}s) and show our method achieves the performance that is comparable to those of the LLR methods that also utilize group-balanced image dataset for retraining.

We present Categorical Traffic Transformer (CTT), a traffic model that outputs both continuous trajectory predictions and tokenized categorical predictions (lane modes, homotopies, etc.). The most outstanding feature of CTT is its fully interpretable latent space, which enables direct supervision of the latent variable from the ground truth during training and avoids mode collapse completely. As a result, CTT can generate diverse behaviors conditioned on different latent modes with semantic meanings while beating SOTA on prediction accuracy. In addition, CTT's ability to input and output tokens enables integration with LLMs for common-sense reasoning and zero-shot generalization. "

        "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive view synthesis results by learning an implicit volumetric representation from multi-view images. To project the implicit representation into an image, NeRF employs volume rendering that approximates the continuous integrals of rays as an accumulation of the colors and densities of the sampled points. Although this approximation enables efficient rendering, it ignores the direction information in point intervals, resulting in ambiguous features and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose an anisotropic neural representation learning method that utilizes learnable view-dependent features to improve scene representation and reconstruction. We model the volumetric function as spherical harmonic (SH)-guided anisotropic features, parameterized by multilayer perceptrons, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the rendering efficiency. To achieve robust scene reconstruction without anisotropy overfitting, we regularize the energy of the anisotropic features during training. Our method is flexiable and can be plugged into NeRF-based frameworks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representation can boost the rendering quality of various NeRFs and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on both synthetic and real-world scenes.

        "abstract": "Semantic representations of text, i.e. representations of natural language which capture meaning by geometry, are essential for areas such as information retrieval and document grouping. High-dimensional trained dense vectors have received much attention in recent years as such representations. We investigate the structure of semantic spaces that arise from embeddings made with Sentence-BERT and find that the representations suffer from a well-known problem in high dimensions called hubness. Hubness results in asymmetric neighborhood relations, such that some texts (the hubs) are neighbours of many other texts while most texts (so-called anti-hubs), are neighbours of few or no other texts. We quantify the semantic quality of the embeddings using hubness scores and error rate of a neighbourhood based classifier. We find that when hubness is high, we can reduce error rate and hubness using hubness reduction methods. We identify a combination of two methods as resulting in the best reduction. For example, on one of the tested pretrained models, this combined method can reduce hubness by about 75% and error rate by about 9%. Thus, we argue that mitigating hubness in the embedding space provides better semantic representations of text. "

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by incorporating external knowledge with parametric memory of language models, has become the state-of-the-art architecture for open-domain QA tasks. However, common knowledge bases are inherently constrained by limited coverage and noisy information, making retrieval-based approaches inadequate to answer implicit reasoning questions. In this paper, we propose an Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework that utilizes inductive knowledge along with the retrieved documents for implicit reasoning. We leverage large language models (LLMs) for deriving such knowledge via a novel prompting method based on inductive reasoning patterns. On top of this, we implement two versions of IAG named IAG-GPT and IAG-Student, respectively. IAG-GPT directly utilizes the knowledge generated by GPT-3 for answer prediction, while IAG-Student gets rid of dependencies on GPT service at inference time by incorporating a student inductor model. The inductor is firstly trained via knowledge distillation and further optimized by back-propagating the generator feedback via differentiable beam scores. Experimental results show that IAG outperforms RAG baselines as well as ChatGPT on two Open-Domain QA tasks. Notably, our best models have won the first place in the official leaderboards of CSQA2.0 (since Nov 1, 2022) and StrategyQA (since Jan 8, 2023). "

Due to the lack of comparable pre-trained models for 3D shapes, recent methods utilize language-image pre-training to realize zero-shot 3D shape recognition. However, due to the modality gap, pretrained language-image models are not confident enough in the generalization to 3D shape recognition. Consequently, this paper aims to improve the confidence with view selection and hierarchical prompts. Leveraging the CLIP model as an example, we employ view selection on the vision side by identifying views with high prediction confidence from multiple rendered views of a 3D shape. On the textual side, the strategy of hierarchical prompts is proposed for the first time. The first layer prompts several classification candidates with traditional class-level descriptions, while the second layer refines the prediction based on function-level descriptions or further distinctions between the candidates. Remarkably, without the need for additional training, our proposed method achieves impressive zero-shot 3D classification accuracies of 84.44\\%, 91.51\\%, and 66.17\\% on ModelNet40, ModelNet10, and ShapeNet Core55, respectively.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) dominate the research field in image-based virtual try-on, but have not resolved problems such as unnatural deformation of garments and the blurry generation quality. Recently, diffusion models have emerged with surprising performance across various image generation tasks. While the generative quality of diffusion models is impressive, achieving controllability poses a significant challenge when applying it to virtual try-on tasks and multiple denoising iterations limit its potential for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model called CAT-DM. To enhance the controllability, a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed, which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration, CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models, CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the in-shop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAT-DM against both GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in producing more realistic images and accurately reproducing garment patterns.

The LRDiff framework constructs an image-rendering process with multiple layers, each of which applies the vision guidance to instructively estimate the denoising direction for a single object. Such a layered rendering strategy effectively prevents issues like unintended conceptual blending or mismatches, while allowing for more coherent and contextually accurate image synthesis. The proposed method provides a more efficient and accurate means of synthesising images that align with specific spatial and contextual requirements. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method provides better results than existing techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. We apply our method to three practical applications: bounding box-to-image, semantic mask-to-image and image editing. "

We have shown in our initial experimental analysis for simple software (e.g., Snake Game, Tic-Tac-Toe, Notepad) that multiple GPT agents can produce high-quality code and document it carefully.

To understand the distribution of climate risk and inform adaptation policies, scientists need to simulate a large number of physically realistic and spatially coherent events. Current methods are limited by computational constraints and the probabilistic spatial distribution of compound events is not given sufficient attention. The bottleneck in current approaches lies in modelling the dependence structure between variables, as inference on parametric models suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are well-suited to such a problem due to their ability to implicitly learn the distribution of data in high-dimensional settings. We employ a GAN to model the dependence structure for daily maximum wind speed, significant wave height, and total precipitation over the Bay of Bengal, combining this with traditional extreme value theory for controlled extrapolation of the tails. Once trained, the model can be used to efficiently generate thousands of realistic compound hazard events, which can inform climate risk assessments for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness. The method developed is flexible and transferable to other multivariate and spatial climate datasets. "

A fundamental workload in this setting is dynamic link prediction: using a history of graph updates to predict whether a given pair of vertices will become connected. Recent schemes for link prediction in such dynamic settings employ Transformers, modeling individual graph updates as single tokens. In this work, we propose HOT: a model that enhances this line of works by harnessing higher-order (HO) graph structures; specifically, k-hop neighbors and more general subgraphs containing a given pair of vertices. Harnessing such HO structures by encoding them into the attention matrix of the underlying Transformer results in higher accuracy of link prediction outcomes, but at the expense of increased memory pressure. To alleviate this, we resort to a recent class of schemes that impose hierarchy on the attention matrix, significantly reducing memory footprint. The final design offers a sweetspot between high accuracy and low memory utilization. HOT outperforms other dynamic GRL schemes, for example achieving 9%, 7%, and 15% higher accuracy than - respectively - DyGFormer, TGN, and GraphMixer, for the MOOC dataset. Our design can be seamlessly extended towards other dynamic GRL workloads. "

In this work, we present MaXTron, a general framework that exploits Mask XFormer with Trajectory Attention to tackle the task. MaXTron enriches an off-the-shelf mask transformer by leveraging trajectory attention. The deployed mask transformer takes as input a short clip consisting of only a few frames and predicts the clip-level segmentation. To enhance the temporal consistency, MaXTron employs within-clip and cross-clip tracking modules, efficiently utilizing trajectory attention. Originally designed for video classification, trajectory attention learns to model the temporal correspondences between neighboring frames and aggregates information along the estimated motion paths. However, it is nontrivial to directly extend trajectory attention to the per-pixel dense prediction tasks due to its quadratic dependency on input size. To alleviate the issue, we propose to adapt the trajectory attention for both the dense pixel features and object queries, aiming to improve the short-term and long-term tracking results, respectively. Particularly, in our within-clip tracking module, we propose axial-trajectory attention that effectively computes the trajectory attention for tracking dense pixels sequentially along the height- and width-axes. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense pixel features. In our cross-clip tracking module, since the object queries in mask transformer are learned to encode the object information, we are able to capture the long-term temporal connections by applying trajectory attention to object queries, which learns to track each object across different clips. Without bells and whistles, MaXTron demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on video segmentation benchmarks. "

Current methods typically employ backbone networks to individually extract the features of RGB frames and event streams, and subsequently fuse these features for pattern recognition. However, we posit that these methods may suffer from key issues like sematic gaps and small-scale backbone networks. In this study, we introduce a novel pattern recognition framework that consolidates the semantic labels, RGB frames, and event streams, leveraging pre-trained large-scale vision-language models. Specifically, given the input RGB frames, event streams, and all the predefined semantic labels, we employ a pre-trained large-scale vision model (CLIP vision encoder) to extract the RGB and event features. To handle the semantic labels, we initially convert them into language descriptions through prompt engineering, and then obtain the semantic features using the pre-trained large-scale language model (CLIP text encoder). Subsequently, we integrate the RGB/Event features and semantic features using multimodal Transformer networks. The resulting frame and event tokens are further amplified using self-attention layers. Concurrently, we propose to enhance the interactions between text tokens and RGB/Event tokens via cross-attention. Finally, we consolidate all three modalities using self-attention and feed-forward layers for recognition.

A promising recent approach in this realm is Delta Denoising Score (DDS) - an image editing technique based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. However, relying solely on the difference between scoring functions is insufficient for preserving specific structural elements from the original image, a crucial aspect of image editing. Inspired by the similarity and importance differences between DDS and the contrastive learning for unpaired image-to-image translation (CUT), here we present an embarrassingly simple yet very powerful modification of DDS, called Contrastive Denoising Score (CDS), for latent diffusion models (LDM). Specifically, to enforce structural correspondence between the input and output while maintaining the controllability of contents, we introduce a straightforward approach to regulate structural consistency using CUT loss within the DDS framework. To calculate this loss, instead of employing auxiliary networks, we utilize the intermediate features of LDM, in particular, those from the self-attention layers, which possesses rich spatial information. Our approach enables zero-shot image-to-image translation and neural radiance field (NeRF) editing, achieving a well-balanced interplay between maintaining the structural details and transforming content.

We thus propose DiffCAD, the first weakly-supervised probabilistic approach to CAD retrieval and alignment from an RGB image. We formulate this as a conditional generative task, leveraging diffusion to learn implicit probabilistic models capturing the shape, pose, and scale of CAD objects in an image. This enables multi-hypothesis generation of different plausible CAD reconstructions, requiring only a few hypotheses to characterize ambiguities in depth/scale and inexact shape matches. Our approach is trained only on synthetic data, leveraging monocular depth and mask estimates to enable robust zero-shot adaptation to various real target domains.

It is a widely researched area as obtaining labeled datasets are expensive. While previous works in the field demonstrated a gradual improvement in segmentation performance, most of them required neural network training. This made segmentation equally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. We thereby propose a lightweight clustering framework for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Attention features of the self-supervised vision transformer exhibit strong foreground-background differentiability. By clustering these features into a small number of clusters, we could separate foreground and background image patches into distinct groupings. In our clustering framework, we first obtain attention features from the self-supervised vision transformer. Then we extract Dataset-level, Category-level and Image-level masks by clustering features within the same dataset, category and image. We further ensure multilevel clustering consistency across the three levels and this allows us to extract patch-level binary pseudo-masks. Finally, the pseudo-mask is upsampled, refined and class assignment is performed according to the CLS token of object regions. Our framework demonstrates great promise in unsupervised semantic segmentation and achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. "

Motivated by this, we introduce a new stochastic vision transformer that integrates uncertainty and distance awareness into self-supervised learning (SSL) pipelines. Instead of the conventional deterministic vector embedding, our novel stochastic vision transformer encodes image patches into elliptical Gaussian distributional embeddings. Notably, the attention matrices of these stochastic representational embeddings are computed using Wasserstein distance-based attention, effectively capitalizing on the distributional nature of these embeddings. Additionally, we propose a regularization term based on Wasserstein distance for both pre-training and fine-tuning processes, thereby incorporating distance awareness into latent representations. We perform extensive experiments across different tasks such as in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection, dataset corruption, semi-supervised settings, and transfer learning to other datasets and tasks. Our proposed method achieves superior accuracy and calibration, surpassing the self-supervised baseline in a wide range of experiments on a variety of datasets. "

While using additional spatial controls with corresponding texts has improved the controllability of large scene synthesis, it is still challenging to faithfully reflect detailed text descriptions without user-provided controls. Here, we propose DetText2Scene, a novel text-driven large-scale image synthesis with high faithfulness, controllability, and naturalness in a global context for the detailed human-centric text description. Our DetText2Scene consists of 1) hierarchical keypoint-box layout generation from the detailed description by leveraging large language model (LLM), 2) view-wise conditioned joint diffusion process to synthesize a large scene from the given detailed text with LLM-generated grounded keypoint-box layout and 3) pixel perturbation-based pyramidal interpolation to progressively refine the large scene for global coherence. Our DetText2Scene significantly outperforms prior arts in text-to-large scene synthesis qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating strong faithfulness with detailed descriptions, superior controllability, and excellent naturalness in a global context.

        "abstract": "In light of the rapidly evolving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), it becomes imperative to develop rigorous domain-specific evaluation benchmarks to accurately assess their capabilities. In response to this need, this paper introduces ArcMMLU, a specialized benchmark tailored for the Library & Information Science (LIS) domain in Chinese. This benchmark aims to measure the knowledge and reasoning capability of LLMs within four key sub-domains: Archival Science, Data Science, Library Science, and Information Science. Following the format of MMLU/CMMLU, we collected over 6,000 high-quality questions for the compilation of ArcMMLU. This extensive compilation can reflect the diverse nature of the LIS domain and offer a robust foundation for LLM evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while most mainstream LLMs achieve an average accuracy rate above 50% on ArcMMLU, there remains a notable performance gap, suggesting substantial headroom for refinement in LLM capabilities within the LIS domain. Further analysis explores the effectiveness of few-shot examples on model performance and highlights challenging questions where models consistently underperform, providing valuable insights for targeted improvements. ArcMMLU fills a critical gap in LLM evaluations within the Chinese LIS domain and paves the way for future development of LLMs tailored to this specialized area. "

In this paper, a multi-agent route planning system capable of solving the Team Orienteering Problem in a very fast and accurate manner is presented. The proposed system is based on a centralized Transformer neural network that can learn to encode the scenario (modeled as a graph) and the context of the agents to provide fast and accurate solutions.

Despite state-of-the-art batching and scheduling, the token generation phase underutilizes compute resources. Specifically, unlike compute-intensive prompt computation phases, token generation phases do not require the compute capability of the latest GPUs, and can be run with lower power and cost. "

We argue that a comprehensive investigation on the key factor of LLM-based evaluation models, such as scaling properties, is lacking, so that it is still inconclusive whether these models have potential to replace GPT-4's evaluation in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new critique generation model called CritiqueLLM, which includes a dialogue-based prompting method for high-quality referenced / reference-free evaluation data. Experimental results show that our model can achieve comparable evaluation performance to GPT-4 especially in system-level correlations, and even outperform GPT-4 in 3 out of 8 tasks in a challenging reference-free setting. We conduct detailed analysis to show promising scaling properties of our model in the quality of generated critiques. We also demonstrate that our generated critiques can act as scalable feedback to directly improve the generation quality of LLMs. "

In this work, we study group-wise sparse, non-linear, multi-layered and learnable mixing schemes of inputs and find that they are complementary to many standard neural architectures. Following our observations and drawing inspiration from the Fast Fourier Transform, we generalize Butterfly Structure to use non-linear mixer function allowing for MLP as mixing function called Butterfly MLP. We were also able to mix along sequence dimension for Transformer-based architectures called Butterfly Attention. Experiments on CIFAR and LRA datasets demonstrate that the proposed Non-Linear Butterfly Mixers are efficient and scale well when the host architectures are used as mixing function.

Here, the two-stream domain adaptation architecture with correlation alignment (CORAL) loss is used as a core model and is equipped with transformer, which provides insights about the learned features and allow efficient parallelization during training. Thanks to the domain adaptation capability of the proposed model, the domain shift between the source and target domain is minimized. Therefore, the model exhibits good generalization where the source and target do not follow the same distribution, and a limited amount of target labeled instances exist. Furthermore, we employ Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide more insight into the model prediction and identify the key features contributing to supply chain credit assessment decisions. The proposed model addresses four significant supply chain credit assessment challenges: domain shift, cold start, imbalanced-class and interpretability.

However, there lacks a systematic and standardized benchmark to foster the development of LLMs in task automation. To this end, we introduce TaskBench to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation. Specifically, task automation can be formulated into three critical stages: task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction to fulfill user intent. This complexity makes data collection and evaluation more challenging compared to common NLP tasks. To generate high-quality evaluation datasets, we introduce the concept of Tool Graph to represent the decomposed tasks in user intent, and adopt a back-instruct method to simulate user instruction and annotations. Furthermore, we propose TaskEval to evaluate the capability of LLMs from different aspects, including task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that TaskBench can effectively reflects the capability of LLMs in task automation. Benefiting from the mixture of automated data construction and human verification, TaskBench achieves a high consistency compared to the human evaluation, which can be utilized as a comprehensive and faithful benchmark for LLM-based autonomous agents.

        "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated a remarkable ability to customize text-to-image diffusion models to multiple, fine-grained concepts in a sequential (i.e., continual) manner while only providing a few example images for each concept. This setting is known as continual diffusion. Here, we ask the question: Can we scale these methods to longer concept sequences without forgetting? Although prior work mitigates the forgetting of previously learned concepts, we show that its capacity to learn new tasks reaches saturation over longer sequences. We address this challenge by introducing a novel method, STack-And-Mask INcremental Adapters (STAMINA), which is composed of low-ranked attention-masked adapters and customized MLP tokens. STAMINA is designed to enhance the robust fine-tuning properties of LoRA for sequential concept learning via learnable hard-attention masks parameterized with low rank MLPs, enabling precise, scalable learning via sparse adaptation. Notably, all introduced trainable parameters can be folded back into the model after training, inducing no additional inference parameter costs. We show that STAMINA outperforms the prior SOTA for the setting of text-to-image continual customization on a 50-concept benchmark composed of landmarks and human faces, with no stored replay data. Additionally, we extended our method to the setting of continual learning for image classification, demonstrating that our gains also translate to state-of-the-art performance in this standard benchmark.

Concretely, at the beginning of each layer, time series data is encoded into several parallel branches, each using a detected periodicity, before going through the transformer encoder block. We conduct extensive evaluations on long- and short-term forecasting datasets comparing MultiResFormer with state-of-the-art baselines.

To investigate this, we first propose the Scrambled Bench, a suite designed to measure the capacity of LLMs to handle scrambled input, in terms of both recovering scrambled sentences and answering questions given scrambled context. The experimental results indicate that most powerful LLMs demonstrate the capability akin to typoglycemia, a phenomenon where humans can understand the meaning of words even when the letters within those words are scrambled, as long as the first and last letters remain in place. More surprisingly, we found that only GPT-4 nearly flawlessly processes inputs with unnatural errors, even under the extreme condition, a task that poses significant challenges for other LLMs and often even for humans. Specifically, GPT-4 can almost perfectly reconstruct the original sentences from scrambled ones, decreasing the edit distance by 95%, even when all letters within each word are entirely scrambled.

We first validate our probe on three pair preference tasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association test (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a relative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best represented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless tasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare ethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender. We observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral model implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and left-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer.

The difficulty is partly because of the degradation of underwater images caused by light selective absorption and scattering. Intuitively, enhancing underwater images can benefit high-level applications like underwater object detection. However, it is still unclear whether all object detectors need underwater image enhancement as pre-processing. We therefore pose the questions \"Does underwater image enhancement really improve underwater object detection?\" and \"How does underwater image enhancement contribute to underwater object detection?\". With these two questions, we conduct extensive studies. Specifically, we use 18 state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement algorithms, covering traditional, CNN-based, and GAN-based algorithms, to pre-process underwater object detection data. Then, we retrain 7 popular deep learning-based object detectors using the corresponding results enhanced by different algorithms, obtaining 126 underwater object detection models. Coupled with 7 object detection models retrained using raw underwater images, we employ these 133 models to comprehensively analyze the effect of underwater image enhancement on underwater object detection.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18829",
        "abstract": "We present MicroCinema, a straightforward yet effective framework for high-quality and coherent text-to-video generation. Unlike existing approaches that align text prompts with video directly, MicroCinema introduces a Divide-and-Conquer strategy which divides the text-to-video into a two-stage process: text-to-image generation and image\\&text-to-video generation. This strategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full advantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALLE, to generate photorealistic and highly detailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image, the model can allocate less focus to fine-grained appearance details, prioritizing the efficient learning of motion dynamics. To implement this strategy effectively, we introduce two core designs. First, we propose the Appearance Injection Network, enhancing the preservation of the appearance of the given image. Second, we introduce the Appearance Noise Prior, a novel mechanism aimed at maintaining the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models. These design elements empower MicroCinema to generate high-quality videos with precise motion, guided by the provided text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Concretely, MicroCinema achieves SOTA zero-shot FVD of 342.86 on UCF-101 and 377.40 on MSR-VTT.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18830",
        "abstract": "Existing diffusion-based video editing models have made gorgeous advances for editing attributes of a source video over time but struggle to manipulate the motion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and background. To address this, we propose MotionEditor, a diffusion model for video motion editing. MotionEditor incorporates a novel content-aware motion adapter into ControlNet to capture temporal motion correspondence. While ControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses, it encounters challenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to contradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference). Our adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer adapted control signals seamlessly. Further, we build up a two-branch architecture (a reconstruction branch and an editing branch) with a high-fidelity attention injection mechanism facilitating branch interaction. This mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the reconstruction branch in a decoupled manner, making the editing branch retain the original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton alignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position. Experiments demonstrate the promising motion editing ability of MotionEditor, both qualitatively and quantitatively. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18832",
        "abstract": "Contents generated by recent advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are sometimes too imaginative for existing off-the-shelf property semantic predictors to estimate due to the immitigable domain gap. We introduce DMP, a pipeline utilizing pre-trained T2I models as a prior for pixel-level semantic prediction tasks. To address the misalignment between deterministic prediction tasks and stochastic T2I models, we reformulate the diffusion process through a sequence of interpolations, establishing a deterministic mapping between input RGB images and output prediction distributions. To preserve generalizability, we use low-rank adaptation to fine-tune pre-trained models. Extensive experiments across five tasks, including 3D property estimation, semantic segmentation, and intrinsic image decomposition, showcase the efficacy of the proposed method. Despite limited-domain training data, the approach yields faithful estimations for arbitrary images, surpassing existing state-of-the-art algorithms. "

        "abstract": "We present ART$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}$V, an efficient framework for auto-regressive video generation with diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that generate entire videos in one-shot, ART$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}$V generates a single frame at a time, conditioned on the previous ones. The framework offers three distinct advantages. First, it only learns simple continual motions between adjacent frames, therefore avoiding modeling complex long-range motions that require huge training data. Second, it preserves the high-fidelity generation ability of the pre-trained image diffusion models by making only minimal network modifications. Third, it can generate arbitrarily long videos conditioned on a variety of prompts such as text, image or their combinations, making it highly versatile and flexible. To combat the common drifting issue in AR models, we propose masked diffusion model which implicitly learns which information can be drawn from reference images rather than network predictions, in order to reduce the risk of generating inconsistent appearances that cause drifting. Moreover, we further enhance generation coherence by conditioning it on the initial frame, which typically contains minimal noise. This is particularly useful for long video generation. When trained for only two weeks on four GPUs, ART$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}$V already can generate videos with natural motions, rich details and a high level of aesthetic quality. Besides, it enables various appealing applications, e.g., composing a long video from multiple text prompts. "

        "abstract": "Empowering models to dynamically accomplish tasks specified through natural language instructions represents a promising path toward more capable and general artificial intelligence. In this work, we introduce InstructSeq, an instruction-conditioned multi-modal modeling framework that unifies diverse vision tasks through flexible natural language control and handling of both visual and textual data. InstructSeq employs a multimodal transformer architecture encompassing visual, language, and sequential modeling. We utilize a visual encoder to extract image features and a text encoder to encode instructions. An autoregressive transformer fuses the representations and generates sequential task outputs. By training with LLM-generated natural language instructions, InstructSeq acquires a strong comprehension of free-form instructions for specifying visual tasks. This provides an intuitive interface for directing capabilities using flexible natural instructions. Without any task-specific tuning, InstructSeq achieves compelling performance on semantic segmentation, referring expression segmentation/comprehension, and image captioning. The flexible control and multi-task unification empower the model with more human-like versatility and generalizability for computer vision. The code will be released soon at https://github.com/rongyaofang/InstructSeq. "

        "abstract": "We introduce PoseGPT, a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and reason about 3D human poses from images or textual descriptions. Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description, a process that intertwines image interpretation, world knowledge, and an understanding of body language. Traditional human pose estimation methods, whether image-based or text-based, often lack holistic scene comprehension and nuanced reasoning, leading to a disconnect between visual data and its real-world implications. PoseGPT addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token within a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. This approach not only simplifies pose prediction but also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human poses, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods. Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing multimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks. Furthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based on complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis. "

We are the first to propose Video Instruction Diffusion (VIDiff), a unified foundation model designed for a wide range of video tasks. These tasks encompass both understanding tasks (such as language-guided video object segmentation) and generative tasks (video editing and enhancement). Our model can edit and translate the desired results within seconds based on user instructions. Moreover, we design an iterative auto-regressive method to ensure consistency in editing and enhancing long videos. We provide convincing generative results for diverse input videos and written instructions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

        "abstract": "Video transformers have become the de facto standard for human action recognition, yet their exclusive reliance on the RGB modality still limits their adoption in certain domains. One such domain is Activities of Daily Living (ADL), where RGB alone is not sufficient to distinguish between visually similar actions, or actions observed from multiple viewpoints. To facilitate the adoption of video transformers for ADL, we hypothesize that the augmentation of RGB with human pose information, known for its sensitivity to fine-grained motion and multiple viewpoints, is essential. Consequently, we introduce the first Pose Induced Video Transformer: PI-ViT (or $\\pi$-ViT), a novel approach that augments the RGB representations learned by video transformers with 2D and 3D pose information. The key elements of $\\pi$-ViT are two plug-in modules, 2D Skeleton Induction Module and 3D Skeleton Induction Module, that are responsible for inducing 2D and 3D pose information into the RGB representations. These modules operate by performing pose-aware auxiliary tasks, a design choice that allows $\\pi$-ViT to discard the modules during inference. Notably, $\\pi$-ViT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three prominent ADL datasets, encompassing both real-world and large-scale RGB-D datasets, without requiring poses or additional computational overhead at inference.

Research in speech-related paradigms has significantly expanded, with a critical impact on the advancement of assistive technologies and communication support for individuals with speech impairments. In this study, GANs were investigated, particularly for the BCI field, and applied to generate text from EEG signals. The GANs could generalize all subjects and decode unseen words, indicating its ability to capture underlying speech patterns consistent across different individuals.

        "abstract": "Micro RNAs (miRNA) are a type of non-coding RNA, which are involved in gene regulation and can be associated with diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. As such, identifying the entire genome of miRNA can be of great relevance. Since experimental methods for novel precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) detection are complex and expensive, computational detection using ML could be useful. Existing ML methods are often complex black boxes, which do not create an interpretable structural description of pre-miRNA. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, which makes use of generative modeling through Variational Auto-Encoders to uncover the generative factors of pre-miRNA. After training the VAE, the pre-miRNA description is developed using a decision tree on the lower dimensional latent space. Applying the framework to miRNA classification, we obtain a high reconstruction and classification performance, while also developing an accurate miRNA description. "

        "abstract": "In the framework of learned image compression, the context model plays a pivotal role in capturing the dependencies among latent representations. To reduce the decoding time resulting from the serial autoregressive context model, the parallel context model has been proposed as an alternative that necessitates only two passes during the decoding phase, thus facilitating efficient image compression in real-world scenarios. However, performance degradation occurs due to its incomplete casual context. To tackle this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance degradation observed in existing parallel context models, focusing on two aspects: the Quantity and Quality of information utilized for context prediction and decoding. Based on such analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Corner-to-Center transformer-based Context Model (C$^3$M)} designed to enhance context and latent predictions and improve rate-distortion performance. Specifically, we leverage the logarithmic-based prediction order to predict more context features from corner to center progressively. In addition, to enlarge the receptive field in the analysis and synthesis transformation, we use the Long-range Crossing Attention Module (LCAM) in the encoder/decoder to capture the long-range semantic information by assigning the different window shapes in different channels. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel methods. Finally, according to the subjective analysis, we suggest that improving the detailed representation in transformer-based image compression is a promising direction to be explored. "

This study examines how training can improve the performance of different age groups in completing a random dot motion (RDM) task. The participants are divided into two groups: old and young. They undergo a three-phase training and then repeat the same RDM task. The hierarchical drift-diffusion model analyzes the subjects' responses and determines how the model's parameters change after training for both age groups. The results show that after training, the participants were able to accumulate sensory information faster, and the model drift rate increased. However, their decision boundary decreased as they became more confident and had a lower decision-making threshold. Additionally, the old group had a higher boundary and lower drift rate in both pre and post-training, and there was less difference between the two group parameters after training. "

        "abstract": "Machine learning prediction of organic materials properties is an efficient virtual screening method ahead of more expensive screening methods. However, this approach has suffered from insufficient labeled data on organic materials to train state-of-the-art machine learning models. In this study, we demonstrate that drug-like small molecule and chemical reaction databases can be used to pretrain the BERT model for the virtual screening of organic materials. Among the BERT models fine-tuned by five virtual screening tasks on organic materials, the USPTO-SMILES pretrained BERT model had R2 > 0.90 for two tasks and R2 > 0.82 for one, which was generally superior to the same models pretrained by the small molecule or organic materials databases, as well as to the other three traditional machine learning models trained directly on the virtual screening task data. The superior performance of the USPTO-SMILES pretrained BERT model is due to the greater variety of organic building blocks in the USPTO database and the broader coverage of the chemical space. The even better performance of the BERT model pretrained externally from a chemical reaction database with additional sources of chemical reactions strengthens our proof of concept that transfer learning across different chemical domains is practical for the virtual screening of organic materials.

It involves adapting the diffusion process in generative diffusion models for improving the calibration of the discriminator during training motivated by the successes of data augmentation schemes in the field to achieve good calibration.

Due to recent successes in leveraging machine learning for clinical decision support, there has been significant interest in the development of deep neural networks for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. A major challenge hindering widespread adoption in clinical use is poor generalization of such networks due to scarcity of large-scale, diverse, balanced prostate imaging datasets for training such networks. In this study, we explore the efficacy of latent diffusion for generating realistic prostate DWI data through the introduction of an anatomic-conditional controlled latent diffusion strategy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to leverage conditioning for synthesis of prostate cancer imaging. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy, which we call Cancer-Net PCa-Gen, enhances synthesis of diverse prostate images through controllable tumour locations and better anatomical and textural fidelity. These crucial features make it well-suited for augmenting real patient data, enabling neural networks to be trained on a more diverse and comprehensive data distribution. The Cancer-Net PCa-Gen framework and sample images have been made publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deetsadi/cancer-net-pca-gen-dataset as a part of a global open-source initiative dedicated to accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid clinicians in the fight against cancer.
