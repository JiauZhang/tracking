        "abstract": "In this research, the application of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model is explored to solve transport equation-based Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The primary objective is to analyze the impact of different activation functions incorporated within the PINN model on its predictive performance, specifically assessing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The dataset used in the study consists of a varied set of input parameters related to strut diameter, unit cell size, and the corresponding yield stress values. Through this investigation the aim is to understand the effectiveness of the PINN model and the significance of choosing appropriate activation functions for solving complex PDEs in real-world applications. The outcomes suggest that the choice of activation function may have minimal influence on the model's predictive accuracy for this particular problem. The PINN model showcases exceptional generalization capabilities, indicating its capacity to avoid overfitting with the provided dataset. The research underscores the importance of striking a balance between performance and computational efficiency while selecting an activation function for specific real-world applications. These valuable findings contribute to advancing the understanding and potential adoption of PINN as an effective tool for solving challenging PDEs in diverse scientific and engineering domains. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00022",
        "abstract": "We present a finite element approach for diffusion problems with thermal fluctuations based on a fluctuating hydrodynamics model. The governing transport equations are stochastic partial differential equations with a fluctuating forcing term. We propose a discrete formulation of the stochastic forcing term that has the correct covariance matrix up to a standard discretization error. Furthermore, to obtain a numerical solution with spatial correlations that converge to those of the continuum equation, we derive a linear mapping to transform the finite element solution into an equivalent discrete solution that is free from the artificial correlations introduced by the spatial discretization. The method is validated by applying it to two diffusion problems: a second-order diffusion equation and a fourth-order diffusion equation. The theoretical (continuum) solution to the first case presents spatially decorrelated fluctuations, while the second case presents fluctuations correlated over a finite length. In both cases, the numerical solution presents a structure factor that approximates well the continuum one. "

Nonetheless, similar to human developers, these models might generate code that contains security vulnerabilities and flaws. Writing secure code remains a substantial challenge, as vulnerabilities often arise during interactions between programs and external systems or services, such as databases and operating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Feedback-Driven Solution Synthesis (FDSS), designed to explore the use of LLMs in receiving feedback from Bandit, which is a static code analysis tool, and then the LLMs generate potential solutions to resolve security vulnerabilities. Each solution, along with the vulnerable code, is then sent back to the LLM for code refinement. Our approach shows a significant improvement over the baseline and outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, PythonSecurityEval, collected from real-world scenarios on Stack Overflow to evaluate the LLMs' ability to generate secure code.

        "abstract": "Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have manifested significant advancements. To facilitate safeguards against malicious exploitation, a body of research has concentrated on aligning LLMs with human preferences and inhibiting their generation of inappropriate content. Unfortunately, such alignments are often vulnerable: fine-tuning with a minimal amount of harmful data can easily unalign the target LLM. While being effective, such fine-tuning-based unalignment approaches also have their own limitations: (1) non-stealthiness, after fine-tuning, safety audits or red-teaming can easily expose the potential weaknesses of the unaligned models, thereby precluding their release/use. (2) non-persistence, the unaligned LLMs can be easily repaired through re-alignment, i.e., fine-tuning again with aligned data points. In this work, we show that it is possible to conduct stealthy and persistent unalignment on large language models via backdoor injections. We also provide a novel understanding on the relationship between the backdoor persistence and the activation pattern and further provide guidelines for potential trigger design. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed stealthy and persistent unalignment can successfully pass the safety evaluation while maintaining strong persistence against re-alignment defense.

To help mitigate this issue, we introduce Bergeron, a framework designed to improve the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks. Bergeron employs a two-tiered architecture. Here, a secondary LLM serves as a simulated conscience that safeguards a primary LLM. We do this by monitoring for and correcting potentially harmful text within both the prompt inputs and the generated outputs of the primary LLM. Empirical evaluation shows that Bergeron can improve the alignment and robustness of several popular LLMs without costly fine-tuning. It aids both open-source and black-box LLMs by complementing and reinforcing their existing alignment training. "

Facing various model attacks, unauthorized use and abuse from the network that threaten the interests of model owners, in addition to considering legal and other administrative measures, it is equally important to protect the model's copyright from the technical means. By using the model watermarking technology, we point out the possibility of building a unified platform for model ownership verification. Given the application history of blockchain in copyright verification and the drawbacks of a centralized third-party, this paper considers combining model watermarking technology and blockchain to build a unified model copyright protection platform. By a new solution we called Tokenized Model, it protects the model's copyright by reliable ownership record and verification mechanism. It also promotes the financial value of model by constructing the model's transaction process and contribution shares of a model.

However, they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks as reported by recent studies. When a data input (e.g., some Gaussian noise) is stamped with a trigger (e.g., a white patch), the backdoored model always generates the target image (e.g., an improper photo). However, effective defense strategies to mitigate backdoors from DMs are underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the first backdoor detection and removal framework for DMs. We evaluate our framework Elijah on hundreds of DMs of 3 types including DDPM, NCSN and LDM, with 13 samplers against 3 existing backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments show that our approach can have close to 100% detection accuracy and reduce the backdoor effects to close to zero without significantly sacrificing the model utility. "

        "abstract": "We introduce MoMask, a novel masked modeling framework for text-driven 3D human motion generation. In MoMask, a hierarchical quantization scheme is employed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with high-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer, with a sequence of motion tokens obtained by vector quantization, the residual tokens of increasing orders are derived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierarchy. This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens, a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i.e. inference) stage, starting from an empty sequence, our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently, a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMask outperforms the state-of-art methods on the text-to-motion generation task, with an FID of 0.045 (vs e.g. 0.141 of T2M-GPT) on the HumanML3D dataset, and 0.228 (vs 0.514) on KIT-ML, respectively. MoMask can also be seamlessly applied in related tasks without further model fine-tuning, such as text-guided temporal inpainting. "

To do so, we simply optimize the text embedding such that the cross-attention maps within the denoising network are localized as Gaussians with small standard deviations. We validate our performance on multiple datasets: the CelebA, CUB-200-2011, Tai-Chi-HD, DeepFashion, and Human3.6m datasets. We achieve significantly improved accuracy, sometimes even outperforming supervised ones, particularly for data that is non-aligned and less curated.

While previous approaches have made significant strides in generating versatile scenes based on text descriptions and a few input images, challenges persist in maintaining the subject fidelity within the generated images. In this work, we introduce an innovative algorithm named HiFi Tuner to enhance the appearance preservation of objects during personalized image generation. Our proposed method employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, comprising a denoising process and a pivotal inversion process. Key enhancements include the utilization of mask guidance, a novel parameter regularization technique, and the incorporation of step-wise subject representations to elevate the sample fidelity. Additionally, we propose a reference-guided generation approach that leverages the pivotal inversion of a reference image to mitigate unwanted subject variations and artifacts. We further extend our method to a novel image editing task: substituting the subject in an image through textual manipulations. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DreamBooth dataset using the Stable Diffusion model showcase promising results. Fine-tuning solely on textual embeddings improves CLIP-T score by 3.6 points and improves DINO score by 9.6 points over Textual Inversion. When fine-tuning all parameters, HiFi Tuner improves CLIP-T score by 1.2 points and improves DINO score by 1.2 points over DreamBooth, establishing a new state of the art. "

        "abstract": "Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. Recently, DETR-like approaches have shown notable progress by decoding the center and length of a target moment from learnable queries. However, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the inherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation. In our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but instead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which the onset and offset are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a Boundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer (BAM-DETR), equipped with a dual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and boundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused attention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on desirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further, we propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high localization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones. Extensive experiments verify the advantages of our methods, where our model records new state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks. Code is at https://github.com/Pilhyeon/BAM-DETR. "

Some recent fine-tuning methods have made it feasible for individuals to implant personalized concepts onto the basic Stable Diffusion model with minimal computational costs on small datasets. However, these innovations have also given rise to issues like facial privacy forgery and artistic copyright infringement. In recent studies, researchers have explored the addition of imperceptible adversarial perturbations to images to prevent potential unauthorized exploitation and infringements when personal data is used for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion. Although these studies have demonstrated the ability to protect images, it is essential to consider that these methods may not be entirely applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the use of perturbations to protect images within a practical threat model. The results suggest that these approaches may not be sufficient to safeguard image privacy and copyright effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a purification method capable of removing protected perturbations while preserving the original image structure to the greatest extent possible. Experiments reveal that Stable Diffusion can effectively learn from purified images over all protective methods. "

        "abstract": "In recent times, automatic text-to-3D content creation has made significant progress, driven by the development of pretrained 2D diffusion models. Existing text-to-3D methods typically optimize the 3D representation to ensure that the rendered image aligns well with the given text, as evaluated by the pretrained 2D diffusion model. Nevertheless, a substantial domain gap exists between 2D images and 3D assets, primarily attributed to variations in camera-related attributes and the exclusive presence of foreground objects. Consequently, employing 2D diffusion models directly for optimizing 3D representations may lead to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we present X-Dreamer, a novel approach for high-quality text-to-3D content creation that effectively bridges the gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. The key components of X-Dreamer are two innovative designs: Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) Loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera information into the pretrained diffusion models by employing camera-dependent generation for trainable parameters. This integration enhances the alignment between the generated 3D assets and the camera's perspective. AMA loss guides the attention map of the pretrained diffusion model using the binary mask of the 3D object, prioritizing the creation of the foreground object. This module ensures that the model focuses on generating accurate and detailed foreground objects.

Most of the existing methods generate a holistic 3D model from a plain text input. This can be problematic when the text describes a complex scene with multiple objects, because the vectorized text embeddings are inherently unable to capture a complex description with multiple entities and relationships. Holistic 3D modeling of the entire scene further prevents accurate grounding of text entities and concepts. To address this limitation, we propose GraphDreamer, a novel framework to generate compositional 3D scenes from scene graphs, where objects are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges. By exploiting node and edge information in scene graphs, our method makes better use of the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is able to fully disentangle different objects without image-level supervision. To facilitate modeling of object-wise relationships, we use signed distance fields as representation and impose a constraint to avoid inter-penetration of objects. To avoid manual scene graph creation, we design a text prompt for ChatGPT to generate scene graphs based on text inputs. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of GraphDreamer in generating high-fidelity compositional 3D scenes with disentangled object entities. "

Recently, various fast samplers utilizing higher-order ODE solvers have emerged and achieved better performance than the initial first-order one. However, these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors, which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g., around 5).

Besides, our method can be easily used as a plugin to further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 256 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors.

Robustness against these attacks is of the utmost importance when designing computer vision applications, especially for safety-critical domains such as CCTV systems. In most practical situations, monitoring open spaces requires multi-view systems to overcome acquisition challenges such as occlusion handling. Multiview object systems are able to combine data from multiple views, and reach reliable detection results even in difficult environments. Despite its importance in real-world vision applications, the vulnerability of multiview systems to adversarial patches is not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we raise the following question: Does the increased performance and information sharing across views offer as a by-product robustness to adversarial patches? We first conduct a preliminary analysis showing promising robustness against off-the-shelf adversarial patches, even in an extreme setting where we consider patches applied to all views by all persons in Wildtrack benchmark. However, we challenged this observation by proposing two new attacks: (i) In the first attack, targeting a multiview CNN, we maximize the global loss by proposing gradient projection to the different views and aggregating the obtained local gradients. (ii) In the second attack, we focus on a Transformer-based multiview framework. In addition to the focal loss, we also maximize the transformer-specific loss by dissipating its attention blocks. Our results show a large degradation in the detection performance of victim multiview systems with our first patch attack reaching an attack success rate of 73% , while our second proposed attack reduced the performance of its target detector by 62% "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00194",
        "abstract": "Distributed representations provide a vector space that captures meaningful relationships between data instances. The distributed nature of these representations, however, entangles together multiple attributes or concepts of data instances (e.g., the topic or sentiment of a text, characteristics of the author (age, gender, etc), etc). Recent work has proposed the task of concept erasure, in which rather than making a concept predictable, the goal is to remove an attribute from distributed representations while retaining other information from the original representation space as much as possible. In this paper, we propose a new distance metric learning-based objective, the Kernelized Rate-Distortion Maximizer (KRaM), for performing concept erasure. KRaM fits a transformation of representations to match a specified distance measure (defined by a labeled concept to erase) using a modified rate-distortion function. Specifically, KRaM's objective function aims to make instances with similar concept labels dissimilar in the learned representation space while retaining other information. We find that optimizing KRaM effectively erases various types of concepts: categorical, continuous, and vector-valued variables from data representations across diverse domains. We also provide a theoretical analysis of several properties of KRaM's objective. To assess the quality of the learned representations, we propose an alignment score to evaluate their similarity with the original representation space. Additionally, we conduct experiments to showcase KRaM's efficacy in various settings, from erasing binary gender variables in word embeddings to vector-valued variables in GPT-3 representations. "

        "abstract": "The problem of novel view synthesis has grown significantly in popularity recently with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and other implicit scene representation methods. A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360 scenes from sparse training views. We find that using naive depth priors is not sufficient and integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by up to 30.5% and NeRF-based methods by up to 15.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost. "

        "abstract": "Testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) under various environmental scenarios that lead the vehicles to unsafe situations is known to be challenging. Given the infinite possible environmental scenarios, it is essential to find critical scenarios efficiently. To this end, we propose a novel testing method, named EpiTESTER, by taking inspiration from epigenetics, which enables species to adapt to sudden environmental changes. In particular, EpiTESTER adopts gene silencing as its epigenetic mechanism, which regulates gene expression to prevent the expression of a certain gene, and the probability of gene expression is dynamically computed as the environment changes. Given different data modalities (e.g., images, lidar point clouds) in the context of AV, EpiTESTER benefits from a multi-model fusion transformer to extract high-level feature representations from environmental factors and then calculates probabilities based on these features with the attention mechanism. To assess the cost-effectiveness of EpiTESTER, we compare it with a classical genetic algorithm (GA) (i.e., without any epigenetic mechanism implemented) and EpiTESTER with equal probability for each gene. We evaluate EpiTESTER with four initial environments from CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, and an end-to-end AV controller, Interfuser. Our results show that EpiTESTER achieved a promising performance in identifying critical scenarios compared to the baselines, showing that applying epigenetic mechanisms is a good option for solving practical problems.

Experiments demonstrate DREAM's superiority over standard diffusion-based SR methods, showing a $2$ to $3\\times $ faster training convergence and a $10$ to $20\\times$ reduction in necessary sampling steps to achieve comparable or superior results.

The interaction with these systems is mediated by prompting, a process in which users write a short text to describe the desired image's content and style. The study of prompts offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain insight into the process of human creativity, yet our understanding of how people use them remains limited. We analyze more than 145,000 prompts from the logs of two Generative AI platforms (Stable Diffusion and Pick-a-Pic) to shed light on how people explore new concepts over time, and how their exploration might be influenced by different design choices in human-computer interfaces to Generative AI. We find that users exhibit a tendency towards exploration of new topics over exploitation of concepts visited previously. However, a comparative analysis of the two platforms, which differ both in scope and functionalities, reveals that the introduction of features diverting user focus from prompting and providing instead shortcuts for generating new image variants with simple clicks is associated with a considerable reduction in both exploration of novel concepts and detail in the submitted prompts. These results carry direct implications for the design of human interfaces to Generative AI and raise new questions regarding how the process of prompting should be aided in ways that best support creativity.

We propose a simple modification to grid-based models by training model heads at different spatial grid resolutions. At render time, we simply use coarser grids to render samples that cover larger volumes. Our method can be easily applied to existing accelerated NeRF methods and significantly improves rendering quality (reducing error rates by 20-90% across synthetic and unbounded real-world scenes) while incurring minimal performance overhead (as each model head is quick to evaluate).

        "abstract": "Hypergraphs as an expressive and general structure have attracted considerable attention from various research domains. Most existing hypergraph node representation learning techniques are based on graph neural networks, and thus adopt the two-stage message passing paradigm (i.e. node -> hyperedge -> node). This paradigm only focuses on local information propagation and does not effectively take into account global information, resulting in less optimal representations. Our theoretical analysis of representative two-stage message passing methods shows that, mathematically, they model different ways of local message passing through hyperedges, and can be unified into one-stage message passing (i.e. node -> node). However, they still only model local information. Motivated by this theoretical analysis, we propose a novel one-stage message passing paradigm to model both global and local information propagation for hypergraphs. We integrate this paradigm into HGraphormer, a Transformer-based framework for hypergraph node representation learning. HGraphormer injects the hypergraph structure information (local information) into Transformers (global information) by combining the attention matrix and hypergraph Laplacian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGraphormer outperforms recent hypergraph learning methods on five representative benchmark datasets on the semi-supervised hypernode classification task, setting new state-of-the-art performance, with accuracy improvements between 2.52% and 6.70%.

Similarly, visually-conditioned Language Modelling is also used to train Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with ICL ability. However, such VLMs typically exhibit weaker classification abilities compared to contrastive learning-based models like CLIP, since the Language Modelling objective does not directly contrast whether an object is paired with a text. To improve the ICL of classification, using more ICEs to provide more knowledge is a straightforward way. However, this may largely increase the selection time, and more importantly, the inclusion of additional in-context images tends to extend the length of the in-context sequence beyond the processing capacity of a VLM. To alleviate these limitations, we propose to manipulate the label space of each ICE to increase its knowledge density, allowing for fewer ICEs to convey as much information as a larger set would. Specifically, we propose two strategies which are Label Distribution Enhancement and Visual Descriptions Enhancement to improve In-context classification performance on diverse datasets, including the classic ImageNet and more fine-grained datasets like CUB-200. Specifically, using our approach on ImageNet, we increase accuracy from 74.70\\% in a 4-shot setting to 76.21\\% with just 2 shots. surpassing CLIP by 0.67\\%.

        "abstract": "Information retrieval in real-time search presents unique challenges distinct from those encountered in classical web search. These challenges are particularly pronounced due to the rapid change of user search intent, which is influenced by the occurrence and evolution of breaking news events, such as earthquakes, elections, and wars. Previous dense retrieval methods, which primarily focused on static semantic representation, lack the capacity to capture immediate search intent, leading to inferior performance in retrieving the most recent event-related documents in time-sensitive scenarios. To address this issue, this paper expands the query with event information that represents real-time search intent. The Event information is then integrated with the query through a cross-attention mechanism, resulting in a time-context query representation. We further enhance the model's capacity for event representation through multi-task training. Since publicly available datasets such as MS-MARCO do not contain any event information on the query side and have few time-sensitive queries, we design an automatic data collection and annotation pipeline to address this issue, which includes ModelZoo-based Coarse Annotation and LLM-driven Fine Annotation processes. In addition, we share the training tricks such as two-stage training and hard negative sampling. Finally, we conduct a set of offline experiments on a million-scale production dataset to evaluate our approach and deploy an A/B testing in a real online system to verify the performance.

However, it is still unknown whether low-rank adapters can be exploited to control LLMs. To address this gap, we demonstrate that an infected adapter can induce, on specific triggers, an LLM to output content defined by an adversary and to even maliciously use tools. To train a Trojan adapter, we propose two novel attacks, POLISHED and FUSION, that improve over prior approaches. POLISHED uses LLM-enhanced paraphrasing to polish benchmark poisoned datasets. In contrast, in the absence of a dataset, FUSION leverages an over-poisoning procedure to transform a benign adaptor. Our experiments validate that our attacks provide higher attack effectiveness than the baseline and, for the purpose of attracting downloads, preserves or improves the adapter's utility. Finally, we provide two case studies to demonstrate that the Trojan adapter can lead a LLM-powered autonomous agent to execute unintended scripts or send phishing emails. Our novel attacks represent the first study of supply chain threats for LLMs through the lens of Trojan plugins. "

In the editing stage, we first employ a pre-trained diffusion model to update facial geometry or texture based on the texts. To enable sequential editing, we introduce a UV domain consistency preservation regularization, preventing unintentional changes to irrelevant facial attributes.

A key problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the token space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very efficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method, executed in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper we focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete tokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large language model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a black-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model as a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on the optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete prompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily become intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic applications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian optimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box optimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and versatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization research built on top of pyTorch.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00508",
        "abstract": "Detecting malicious URLs is a crucial aspect of web search and mining, significantly impacting internet security. Though advancements in machine learning have improved the effectiveness of detection methods, these methods still face significant challenges in their capacity to generalize and their resilience against evolving threats. In this paper, we propose PyraTrans, an approach that combines the strengths of pretrained Transformers and pyramid feature learning for improving malicious URL detection. We implement PyraTrans by leveraging a pretrained CharBERT as the base and augmenting it with 3 connected feature modules: 1) The Encoder Feature Extraction module, which extracts representations from each encoder layer of CharBERT to obtain multi-order features; 2) The Multi-Scale Feature Learning Module, which captures multi-scale local contextual insights and aggregate information across different layer-levels; and 3) The Pyramid Spatial Attention Module, which learns hierarchical and spatial feature attentions, highlighting critical classification signals while reducing noise. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of the Transformer in local feature learning and spatial awareness, and enabling us to extract multi-order, multi-scale URL feature representations with enhanced attentional focus. PyraTrans is evaluated using 4 benchmark datasets, where it demonstrated significant advancements over prior baseline methods. Particularly, on the imbalanced dataset, our method, with just 10% of the data for training, the TPR is 3.3-6.5 times and the F1-score is 2.9-4.5 times that of the baseline. Our approach also demonstrates robustness against adversarial attacks. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/Alixyvtte/PyraTrans. "

        "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of multivariate traffic flow time series remains challenging due to substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity and complex long-range correlative patterns. To address this, we propose Spatio-Temporal-Decoupled Masked Pre-training (STD-MAE), a novel framework that employs masked autoencoders to learn and encode complex spatio-temporal dependencies via pre-training. Specifically, we use two decoupled masked autoencoders to reconstruct the traffic data along spatial and temporal axes using a self-supervised pre-training approach. These mask reconstruction mechanisms capture the long-range correlations in space and time separately. The learned hidden representations are then used to augment the downstream spatio-temporal traffic predictor. A series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four widely-used traffic benchmarks (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08) are conducted to verify the state-of-the-art performance, with STD-MAE explicitly enhancing the downstream spatio-temporal models' ability to capture long-range intricate spatial and temporal patterns.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel application of Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) to study visual aspects of social processes. I train a a StyleGAN2-model on a custom dataset of 14,564 images of London, sourced from Google Streetview taken in London. After training, I invert the images in the training set, finding points in the model's latent space that correspond to them, and compare results from three inversion techniques. I connect each data point with metadata from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, describing income, health and environmental quality in the area where the photographs were taken. It is then possible to map which parts of the model's latent space encode visual features that are distinctive for health, income and environmental quality, and condition the synthesis of new images based on these factors. The synthetic images created reflect visual features of social processes that were previously unknown and difficult to study, describing recurring visual differences between deprived and privileged areas in London. GANs are known for their capability to produce a continuous range of images that exhibit visual differences. The paper tests how to exploit this ability through visual comparisons in still images as well as through an interactive website where users can guide image synthesis with sliders. Though conditioned synthesis has its limitations and the results are difficult to validate, the paper points to the potential for generative models to be repurposed to be parts of social scientific methods.

        "abstract": "Instruction-tuning is a widely adopted method of finetuning that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate output that more closely resembles human responses to natural language queries, in many cases leading to human-level performance on diverse testbeds. However, it remains unclear whether instruction-tuning truly makes LLMs more similar to how humans process language. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on LLM-human similarity in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs across three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences. We discover that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment by an average of 6%, but does not have a similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify the factors underlying LLM-brain alignment, we compute correlations between the brain alignment of LLMs and various model properties, such as model size, various problem-solving abilities, and performance on tasks requiring world knowledge spanning various domains. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain.

However, this capability remains largely under explored within existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hindering their capacity to learn the fundamental principles of how things operate and the intentions behind the observed subjects. To address this issue, we introduce the integration of future modeling into the existing learning frameworks of MLLMs. By utilizing the subject trajectory, a highly structured representation of a consecutive frame sequence, as a learning objective, we aim to bridge the gap between the past and the future. We propose two innovative methods to empower MLLMs with foresight minds, Foresight Pre-Training (FPT) and Foresight Instruction-Tuning (FIT), which are inspired by the modern learning paradigm of LLMs. Specifically, FPT jointly training various tasks centered on trajectories, enabling MLLMs to learn how to attend and predict entire trajectories from a given initial observation. Then, FIT requires MLLMs to first predict trajectories of related objects and then reason about potential future events based on them. Aided by FPT and FIT, we build a novel and unified MLLM named Merlin that supports multi-images input and analysis about potential actions of multiple objects for the future reasoning. Experimental results show Merlin powerful foresight minds with impressive performance on both future reasoning and visual comprehension tasks. "

To validate the precision of our annotations, we assess event recognition performance using several CNN-RNN architectures. Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate a hybrid transformer architecture coupled with a customized training-inference framework to recognize four specific events in laparoscopic surgery videos. Leveraging the Transformer networks, our proposed architecture harnesses inter-frame dependencies to counteract the adverse effects of relevant content occlusion, motion blur, and surgical scene variation, thus significantly enhancing event recognition accuracy. Moreover, we present a frame sampling strategy designed to manage variations in surgical scenes and the surgeons' skill level, resulting in event recognition with high temporal resolution. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in event recognition compared to conventional CNN-RNN architectures through a series of extensive experiments. "

However, the effectiveness of popular normalization technologies is typically limited to specific areas. Unlike the standard Batch Normalization (BN) and Layer Normalization (LN), where BN computes the mean and variance along the (N,H,W) dimensions and LN computes the mean and variance along the (C,H,W) dimensions (N, C, H and W are the batch, channel, spatial height and width dimension, respectively), this paper presents a novel normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN). To exploit both the channel and batch dependence and adaptively and combine the advantages of BN and LN based on specific datasets or tasks, BCN separately normalizes inputs along the (N, H, W) and (C, H, W) axes, then combines the normalized outputs based on adaptive parameters. As a basic block, BCN can be easily integrated into existing models for various applications in the field of computer vision. Empirical results show that the proposed technique can be seamlessly applied to various versions of CNN or Vision Transformer architecture.

Despite the demonstrated improvements in accuracy and velocity estimation compared to perspective view methods, the deployment of BEV-based techniques in real-world autonomous vehicles remains challenging. This is primarily due to their reliance on vision-transformer (ViT) based architectures, which introduce quadratic complexity with respect to the input resolution. To address this issue, we propose an efficient BEV-based 3D detection framework called BEVENet, which leverages a convolutional-only architectural design to circumvent the limitations of ViT models while maintaining the effectiveness of BEV-based methods. Our experiments show that BEVENet is 3$\\times$ faster than contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the NuScenes challenge, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.456 and a nuScenes detection score (NDS) of 0.555 on the NuScenes validation dataset, with an inference speed of 47.6 frames per second. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as the first to achieve such significant efficiency improvements for BEV-based methods, highlighting their enhanced feasibility for real-world autonomous driving applications.

TrackDiffusion represents a significant departure from the traditional layout-to-image (L2I) generation and copy-paste synthesis focusing on static image elements like bounding boxes by empowering image diffusion models to encompass dynamic and continuous tracking trajectories, thereby capturing complex motion nuances and ensuring instance consistency among video frames. For the first time, we demonstrate that the generated video sequences can be utilized for training multi-object tracking (MOT) systems, leading to significant improvement in tracker performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly enhances instance consistency in generated video sequences, leading to improved perceptual metrics. Our approach achieves an improvement of 8.7 in TrackAP and 11.8 in TrackAP$_{50}$ on the YTVIS dataset, underscoring its potential to redefine the standards of video data generation for MOT tasks and beyond.

However, such large models are susceptible to overfitting to their training data, and as a result the models perform poorly when the domain changes. Also, due to the model's scale, the cost of fine-tuning the model to the new domain is large. Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) has been proposed as a regulariser for training cross-attention in Transformers, potentially addressing the overfitting problem. We extend the NVIB framework to replace all types of attention functions in Transformers, and show that existing pretrained Transformers can be reinterpreted as Nonparametric Variational (NV) models using a proposed identity initialisation. We then show that changing the initialisation introduces a novel, information-theoretic post-training regularisation in the attention mechanism, which improves out-of-domain generalisation without any training. This success supports the hypothesis that pretrained Transformers are implicitly NV Bayesian models. "

Most of the existing CLIP-alike works usually adopt relatively large image encoders like ResNet50 and ViT, while the lightweight counterparts are rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a multi-level interaction paradigm for training lightweight CLIP models. Firstly, to mitigate the problem that some image-text pairs are not strictly one-to-one correspondence, we improve the conventional global instance-level alignment objective by softening the label of negative samples progressively. Secondly, a relaxed bipartite matching based token-level alignment objective is introduced for finer-grained alignment between image patches and textual words. Moreover, based on the observation that the accuracy of CLIP model does not increase correspondingly as the parameters of text encoder increase, an extra objective of masked language modeling (MLM) is leveraged for maximizing the potential of the shortened text encoder. In practice, an auxiliary fusion module injecting unmasked image embedding into masked text embedding at different network stages is proposed for enhancing the MLM. Extensive experiments show that without introducing additional computational cost during inference, the proposed method achieves a higher performance on multiple downstream tasks. "

In this paper we propose a transparent, interpretable, and linguistically motivated strategy for encoding the contextual sense of words by modeling semantic compositionality. Particular attention is given to dependency relations and semantic notions such as selection preferences and paradigmatic classes. A partial implementation of the proposed model is carried out and compared with Transformer-based architectures for a given semantic task, namely the similarity calculation of word senses in context.

One type of popular solution is using detection models to detect components of a table, such as columns and rows, then applying a rule-based post-processing method to convert detection results into HTML sequences. However, existing detection-based studies often have the following limitations. First, these studies usually pay more attention to improving the detection performance, which does not necessarily lead to better performance regarding cell-level metrics, such as TEDS. Second, some solutions over-simplify the problem and can miss some critical information. Lastly, even though some studies defined the problem to detect more components to provide as much information as other types of solutions, these studies ignore the fact this problem definition is a multi-label detection because row, projected row header and column header can share identical bounding boxes. Besides, there is often a performance gap between two-stage and transformer-based detection models regarding the structure-only TEDS, even though they have similar performance regarding the COCO metrics. Therefore, we revisit the limitations of existing detection-based solutions, compare two-stage and transformer-based detection models, and identify the key design aspects for the success of a two-stage detection model for the TSR task, including the multi-class problem definition, the aspect ratio for anchor box generation, and the feature generation of the backbone network.

For the former, we select the final projection (linear) layer in the multi-head self-attention of a Transformer model, and verify its effectiveness.

We then propose a novel regularizer that penalizes the norm of the difference between the smooth output tokens from self-attention and the input tokens to preserve the fidelity of the tokens. Minimizing the resulting regularized energy functional, we derive the Neural Transformer with a Regularized Nonlocal Functional (NeuTRENO), a novel class of transformer models that can mitigate the over-smoothing issue. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of NeuTRENO over the baseline transformers and state-of-the-art methods in reducing the over-smoothing of token representations on various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling.

        "abstract": "Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00761",
        "abstract": "Machine unlearning has emerged as a prominent and challenging area of interest, driven in large part by the rising regulatory demands for industries to delete user data upon request and the heightened awareness of privacy. Existing approaches either retrain models from scratch or use several finetuning steps for every deletion request, often constrained by computational resource limitations and restricted access to the original training data. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate an entire class or a group of classes from the learned model. To that end, our algorithm first estimates the Retain Space and the Forget Space, representing the feature or activation spaces for samples from classes to be retained and unlearned, respectively. To obtain these spaces, we propose a novel singular value decomposition-based technique that requires layer wise collection of network activations from a few forward passes through the network. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space for unlearning. Finally, we project the model weights in the orthogonal direction of the class-discriminatory space to obtain the unlearned model. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only $\\sim$1.5% drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under 1% accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Further, our algorithm consistently performs well when subject to Membership Inference Attacks showing 7.8% improvement on average across a variety of image classification datasets and network architectures, as compared to other baselines while being $\\sim$6x more computationally efficient.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00763",
        "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) powered chatbots are primarily text-based today, and impose a large interactional cognitive load, especially for exploratory or sensemaking tasks such as planning a trip or learning about a new city. Because the interaction is textual, users have little scaffolding in the way of structure, informational \"scent\", or ability to specify high-level preferences or goals. We introduce ExploreLLM that allows users to structure thoughts, help explore different options, navigate through the choices and recommendations, and to more easily steer models to generate more personalized responses. We conduct a user study and show that users find it helpful to use ExploreLLM for exploratory or planning tasks, because it provides a useful schema-like structure to the task, and guides users in planning. The study also suggests that users can more easily personalize responses with high-level preferences with ExploreLLM. Together, ExploreLLM points to a future where users interact with LLMs beyond the form of chatbots, and instead designed to support complex user tasks with a tighter integration between natural language and graphical user interfaces.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00777",
        "abstract": "Text-driven video generation witnesses rapid progress. However, merely using text prompts is not enough to depict the desired subject appearance that accurately aligns with users' intents, especially for customized content creation. In this paper, we study the task of video generation with image prompts, which provide more accurate and direct content control beyond the text prompts. Specifically, we propose a feed-forward framework VideoBooth, with two dedicated designs: 1) We propose to embed image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse visual embeddings from image encoder provide high-level encodings of image prompts, while fine visual embeddings from the proposed attention injection module provide multi-scale and detailed encoding of image prompts. These two complementary embeddings can faithfully capture the desired appearance. 2) In the attention injection module at fine level, multi-scale image prompts are fed into different cross-frame attention layers as additional keys and values. This extra spatial information refines the details in the first frame and then it is propagated to the remaining frames, which maintains temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoBooth achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating customized high-quality videos with subjects specified in image prompts. Notably, VideoBooth is a generalizable framework where a single model works for a wide range of image prompts with feed-forward pass. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00778",
        "abstract": "Neural rendering has demonstrated remarkable success in dynamic scene reconstruction. Thanks to the expressiveness of neural representations, prior works can accurately capture the motion and achieve high-fidelity reconstruction of the target object. Despite this, real-world video scenarios often feature large unobserved regions where neural representations struggle to achieve realistic completion. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MorpheuS, a framework for dynamic 360{\\deg} surface reconstruction from a casually captured RGB-D video. Our approach models the target scene as a canonical field that encodes its geometry and appearance, in conjunction with a deformation field that warps points from the current frame to the canonical space. We leverage a view-dependent diffusion prior and distill knowledge from it to achieve realistic completion of unobserved regions. Experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method can achieve high-fidelity 360{\\deg} surface reconstruction of a deformable object from a monocular RGB-D video.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00258",
        "abstract": "Climate change has led to an increase in frequency of extreme weather events. Early warning systems can prevent disasters and loss of life. Managing such events remain a challenge for both public and private institutions. Precipitation nowcasting can help relevant institutions to better prepare for such events. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) has traditionally been used to make physics based forecasting, and recently deep learning based approaches have been used to reduce turn-around time for nowcasting. In this work, recently proposed Swin-UNETR (Swin UNEt TRansformer) is used for precipitation nowcasting for ten different regions of Europe. Swin-UNETR utilizes a U-shaped network within which a swin transformer-based encoder extracts multi-scale features from multiple input channels of satellite image, while CNN-based decoder makes the prediction. Trained model is capable of nowcasting not only for the regions for which data is available, but can also be used for new regions for which data is not available. "
