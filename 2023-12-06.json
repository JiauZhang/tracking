        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02168",
        "abstract": "The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in deep learning. Originally designed for digit classification tasks, the SVHN dataset has been widely used as a benchmark for various other tasks including generative modeling. However, with this work, we aim to warn the community about an issue of the SVHN dataset as a benchmark for generative modeling tasks: we discover that the official split into training set and test set of the SVHN dataset are not drawn from the same distribution. We empirically show that this distribution mismatch has little impact on the classification task (which may explain why this issue has not been detected before), but it severely affects the evaluation of probabilistic generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders and diffusion models. As a workaround, we propose to mix and re-split the official training and test set when SVHN is used for tasks other than classification. We publish a new split and the indices we used to create it at https://jzenn.github.io/svhn-remix/ . "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) solve problems more accurately and interpretably when instructed to work out the answer step by step using a ``chain-of-thought'' (CoT) prompt. One can also improve LLMs' performance on a specific task by supervised fine-tuning, i.e., by using gradient ascent on some tunable parameters to maximize the average log-likelihood of correct answers from a labeled training set. Naively combining CoT with supervised tuning requires supervision not just of the correct answers, but also of detailed rationales that lead to those answers; these rationales are expensive to produce by hand. Instead, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that tries to maximize the \\emph{marginal} log-likelihood of generating a correct answer using CoT prompting, approximately averaging over all possible rationales. The core challenge is sampling from the posterior over rationales conditioned on the correct answer; we address it using a simple Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm inspired by the self-taught reasoner (STaR), memoized wake-sleep, Markovian score climbing, and persistent contrastive divergence. This algorithm also admits a novel control-variate technique that drives the variance of our gradient estimates to zero as the model improves. Applying our technique to GSM8K and the tasks in BIG-Bench Hard, we find that this MCMC-EM fine-tuning technique typically improves the model's accuracy on held-out examples more than STaR or prompt-tuning with or without CoT.

        "abstract": "In the realm of text-to-3D generation, utilizing 2D diffusion models through score distillation sampling (SDS) frequently leads to issues such as blurred appearances and multi-faced geometry, primarily due to the intrinsically noisy nature of the SDS loss. Our analysis identifies the core of these challenges as the interaction among noise levels in the 2D diffusion process, the architecture of the diffusion network, and the 3D model representation. To overcome these limitations, we present StableDreamer, a methodology incorporating three advances. First, inspired by InstructNeRF2NeRF, we formalize the equivalence of the SDS generative prior and a simple supervised L2 reconstruction loss. This finding provides a novel tool to debug SDS, which we use to show the impact of time-annealing noise levels on reducing multi-faced geometries. Second, our analysis shows that while image-space diffusion contributes to geometric precision, latent-space diffusion is crucial for vivid color rendition. Based on this observation, StableDreamer introduces a two-stage training strategy that effectively combines these aspects, resulting in high-fidelity 3D models. Third, we adopt an anisotropic 3D Gaussians representation, replacing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), to enhance the overall quality, reduce memory usage during training, and accelerate rendering speeds, and better capture semi-transparent objects. StableDreamer reduces multi-face geometries, generates fine details, and converges stably. "

Diffusion Handles address a critically missing facet of generative image based creative design, and significantly advance the state-of-the-art in generative image editing. Our key insight is to lift diffusion activations for an object to 3D using a proxy depth, 3D-transform the depth and associated activations, and project them back to image space. The diffusion process applied to the manipulated activations with identity control, produces plausible edited images showing complex 3D occlusion and lighting effects. We evaluate Diffusion Handles: quantitatively, on a large synthetic data benchmark; and qualitatively by a user study, showing our output to be more plausible, and better than prior art at both, 3D editing and identity control.

To this end, we present a feasible way of exploiting the image priors captured by the pretrained diffusion model, through addressing the two challenges, i.e., degradation modeling and diffusion guidance. The former aims to simulate the process of the clean image degenerated by certain degradations, and the latter aims at guiding the diffusion model to generate the corresponding clean image. With the motivations, we propose a zero-shot framework for all-in-one image restoration, termed ZeroAIR, which alternatively performs the test-time degradation modeling (TDM) and the three-stage diffusion guidance (TDG) at each timestep of the reverse sampling. To be specific, TDM exploits the diffusion priors to learn a degradation model from a given degraded image, and TDG divides the timesteps into three stages for taking full advantage of the varying diffusion priors. Thanks to their degradation-agnostic property, the all-in-one image restoration could be achieved in a zero-shot way by ZeroAIR. Through extensive experiments, we show that our ZeroAIR achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods. The code will be available on Github. "

Despite the high-quality novel view rendering that NeRF provides, a critical limitation is that it relies on volume rendering that can be computationally expensive and does not utilize the advancements in modern graphics hardware. Existing methods for this problem fall short when it comes to modelling volumetric effects as they rely purely on surface rendering. We thus propose to model the scene with polygons, which can then be used to obtain the quadrature points required to model volumetric effects, and also their opacity and colour from the texture. To obtain such polygonal mesh, we train a specialized field whose zero-crossings would correspond to the quadrature points when volume rendering, and perform marching cubes on this field. We then rasterize the polygons and utilize the fragment shaders to obtain the final colour image. Our method allows rendering on various devices and easy integration with existing graphics frameworks while keeping the benefits of volume rendering alive. "

In this study, we identify principles that guide RMs to better align with human preferences, and then develop an axiomatic framework to generate a rich variety of preference signals to uphold them. We use these axiomatic signals to train a model for scoring answers to longform questions. Our approach yields a Preference Model with only about 220M parameters that agrees with gold human-annotated preference labels more often than GPT-4. The contributions of this work include: training a standalone preference model that can score human- and LLM-generated answers on the same scale; developing an axiomatic framework for generating training data pairs tailored to certain principles; and showing that a small amount of axiomatic signals can help small models outperform GPT-4 in preference scoring.

This framework leverages off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models, eliminating the need for fine-tuning specific examples. Specifically, the content and style images are first inverted into latent codes. Then, during image reconstruction using the corresponding latent code, the content and style features in the attention space are delicately blended through a modified self-attention operation called Style Attention Control. Additionally, a Chain-of-Painting method is proposed for the gradual redrawing of unsatisfactory areas from rough adjustments to fine-tuning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our Portrait Diffusion method and demonstrate the superiority of Chain-of-Painting in achieving precise face stylization.

The inverse discrete wavelet transform reconstructs N feature signals at varying detail, which are linearly decoded to approximate the color and density of volumes in a 4-D grid. Exploiting the sparsity of wavelet coefficients, we compress a Hash Map containing only non-zero coefficients and their locations on each plane. This results in a compressed model size of ~12 MB. Compared with state-of-the-art plane-based models, WavePlanes is up to 15x smaller, less computationally demanding and achieves comparable results in as little as one hour of training - without requiring custom CUDA code or high performance computing resources.

        "abstract": "Large Vision and Language Models have enabled significant advances in fully supervised and zero-shot vision tasks. These large pre-trained architectures serve as the baseline to what is currently known as Instruction Tuning Large Vision and Language models (IT-LVLMs). IT-LVLMs are general-purpose multi-modal assistants whose responses are modulated by natural language instructions and arbitrary visual data. Despite this versatility, IT-LVLM effectiveness in fundamental computer vision problems remains unclear, primarily due to the absence of a standardized evaluation benchmark. This paper introduces a Multi-modal Evaluation Benchmark named MERLIM, a scalable test-bed to assess the performance of IT-LVLMs on fundamental computer vision tasks. MERLIM contains over 279K image-question pairs, and has a strong focus on detecting cross-modal \"hallucination\" events in IT-LVLMs, where the language output refers to visual concepts that lack any effective grounding in the image. Our results show that state-of-the-art IT-LVMLs are still limited at identifying fine-grained visual concepts, object hallucinations are common across tasks, and their results are strongly biased by small variations in the input query, even if the queries have the very same semantics. Our findings also suggest that these models have weak visual groundings but they can still make adequate guesses by global visual patterns or textual biases contained in the LLM component. "

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant trend in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly transformer-based models, of developing ever-larger and more capable models. While they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, their growing scale requires increased computational resources (e.g., GPUs with greater memory capacity). To address this problem, quantization techniques (i.e., low-bit-precision representation and matrix multiplication) have been proposed. Most quantization techniques employ a static strategy in which the model parameters are quantized, either during training or inference, without considering the test-time sample. In contrast, dynamic quantization techniques, which have become increasingly popular, adapt during inference based on the input provided, while maintaining full-precision performance. However, their dynamic behavior and average-case performance assumption makes them vulnerable to a novel threat vector -- adversarial attacks that target the model's efficiency and availability. In this paper, we present QuantAttack, a novel attack that targets the availability of quantized models, slowing down the inference, and increasing memory usage and energy consumption. We show that carefully crafted adversarial examples, which are designed to exhaust the resources of the operating system, can trigger worst-case performance. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on vision transformers on a wide range of tasks, both uni-modal and multi-modal. We also examine the effect of different attack variants (e.g., a universal perturbation) and the transferability between different models. "

        "abstract": "We introduce multi-slice reasoning, a new notion for single-view 3D reconstruction which challenges the current and prevailing belief that multi-view synthesis is the most natural conduit between single-view and 3D. Our key observation is that object slicing is more advantageous than altering views to reveal occluded structures. Specifically, slicing is more occlusion-revealing since it can peel through any occluders without obstruction. In the limit, i.e., with infinitely many slices, it is guaranteed to unveil all hidden object parts. We realize our idea by developing Slice3D, a novel method for single-view 3D reconstruction which first predicts multi-slice images from a single RGB image and then integrates the slices into a 3D model using a coordinate-based transformer network for signed distance prediction. The slice images can be regressed or generated, both through a U-Net based network. For the former, we inject a learnable slice indicator code to designate each decoded image into a spatial slice location, while the slice generator is a denoising diffusion model operating on the entirety of slice images stacked on the input channels. We conduct extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art alternatives to demonstrate superiority of our method, especially in recovering complex and severely occluded shape structures, amid ambiguities. All Slice3D results were produced by networks trained on a single Nvidia A40 GPU, with an inference time less than 20 seconds. "

Specifically, we harness the knowledge in LLMs to produce a set of descriptive sentences that contain distinctive features for identifying given actions. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a multi-modal action knowledge alignment mechanism to align concepts in video and textual knowledge encapsulated within the prompts.

Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-costly and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results. "

This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context.

In this paper, we explore whether generative fine-tuning is essential for this improvement and whether it is possible to further scale up training using more synthetic data. We present a new framework leveraging off-the-shelf generative models to generate synthetic training images, addressing multiple challenges: class name ambiguity, lack of diversity in naive prompts, and domain shifts. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and CLIP to resolve class name ambiguity. To diversify images, we propose contextualized diversification (CD) and stylized diversification (SD) methods, also prompted by LLMs. Finally, to mitigate domain shifts, we leverage domain adaptation techniques with auxiliary batch normalization for synthetic images. Our framework consistently enhances recognition model performance with more synthetic data, up to 6x of original ImageNet size showcasing the potential of synthetic data for improved recognition models and strong out-of-domain generalization.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02255",
        "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable novel view synthesis capabilities even in large-scale, unbounded scenes, albeit requiring hundreds of views or introducing artifacts in sparser settings. Their optimization suffers from shape-radiance ambiguities wherever only a small visual overlap is available. This leads to erroneous scene geometry and artifacts. In this paper, we propose Re-Nerfing, a simple and general multi-stage approach that leverages NeRF's own view synthesis to address these limitations. With Re-Nerfing, we increase the scene's coverage and enhance the geometric consistency of novel views as follows: First, we train a NeRF with the available views. Then, we use the optimized NeRF to synthesize pseudo-views next to the original ones to simulate a stereo or trifocal setup. Finally, we train a second NeRF with both original and pseudo views while enforcing structural, epipolar constraints via the newly synthesized images. Extensive experiments on the mip-NeRF 360 dataset show the effectiveness of Re-Nerfing across denser and sparser input scenarios, bringing improvements to the state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF, even when trained with all views.

        "abstract": "We introduce Efficient Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM) for fast and high-quality human motion generation. Although previous motion diffusion models have shown impressive results, they struggle to achieve fast generation while maintaining high-quality human motions. Motion latent diffusion has been proposed for efficient motion generation. However, effectively learning a latent space can be non-trivial in such a two-stage manner. Meanwhile, accelerating motion sampling by increasing the step size, e.g., DDIM, typically leads to a decline in motion quality due to the inapproximation of complex data distributions when naively increasing the step size. In this paper, we propose EMDM that allows for much fewer sample steps for fast motion generation by modeling the complex denoising distribution during multiple sampling steps. Specifically, we develop a Conditional Denoising Diffusion GAN to capture multimodal data distributions conditioned on both control signals, i.e., textual description and denoising time step. By modeling the complex data distribution, a larger sampling step size and fewer steps are achieved during motion synthesis, significantly accelerating the generation process. To effectively capture the human dynamics and reduce undesired artifacts, we employ motion geometric loss during network training, which improves the motion quality and training efficiency. As a result, EMDM achieves a remarkable speed-up at the generation stage while maintaining high-quality motion generation in terms of fidelity and diversity. "

In our study, we introduce a cutting-edge framework, VaQuitA, designed to refine the synergy between video and textual information. At the data level, instead of sampling frames uniformly, we implement a sampling method guided by CLIP-score rankings, which enables a more aligned selection of frames with the given question. At the feature level, we integrate a trainable Video Perceiver alongside a Visual-Query Transformer (abbreviated as VQ-Former), which bolsters the interplay between the input question and the video features. We also discover that incorporating a simple prompt, \"Please be critical\", into the LLM input can substantially enhance its video comprehension capabilities. Our experimental results indicate that VaQuitA consistently sets a new benchmark for zero-shot video question-answering tasks and is adept at producing high-quality, multi-turn video dialogues with users.

First we propose a clustering-based algorithm for measuring distributional shifts in text data by exploiting such embeddings. Then we study the effectiveness of our approach when applied to text embeddings generated by both LLMs and classical embedding algorithms. Our experiments show that general-purpose LLM-based embeddings provide a high sensitivity to data drift compared to other embedding methods. We propose drift sensitivity as an important evaluation metric to consider when comparing language models.

        "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields have achieved remarkable results for novel view synthesis but still lack a crucial component: precise measurement of uncertainty in their predictions. Probabilistic NeRF methods have tried to address this, but their output probabilities are not typically accurately calibrated, and therefore do not capture the true confidence levels of the model. Calibration is a particularly challenging problem in the sparse-view setting, where additional held-out data is unavailable for fitting a calibrator that generalizes to the test distribution. In this paper, we introduce the first method for obtaining calibrated uncertainties from NeRF models. Our method is based on a robust and efficient metric to calculate per-pixel uncertainties from the predictive posterior distribution. We propose two techniques that eliminate the need for held-out data. The first, based on patch sampling, involves training two NeRF models for each scene. The second is a novel meta-calibrator that only requires the training of one NeRF model. Our proposed approach for obtaining calibrated uncertainties achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty in the sparse-view setting while maintaining image quality. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness in applications such as view enhancement and next-best view selection. "

Neural rendering methods based on point clouds do exist, but they do not perform well when the point cloud quality is low -- e.g., sparse or incomplete, which is often the case with real-world data. We overcome these problems with a simple representation that aggregates point clouds at multiple scale levels with sparse voxel grids at different resolutions. To deal with point cloud sparsity, we average across multiple scale levels -- but only among those that are valid, i.e., that have enough neighboring points in proximity to the ray of a pixel. To help model areas without points, we add a global voxel at the coarsest scale, thus unifying \"classical\" and point-based NeRF formulations. We validate our method on the NeRF Synthetic, ScanNet, and KITTI-360 datasets, outperforming the state of the art by a significant margin. "

Here we introduce two new easy-to-use methods for evaluating watermarking algorithms for LLMs: 1) evaluation by LLM-judger with specific guidelines; and 2) binary classification on text embeddings to distinguish between watermarked and unwatermarked text. We apply these methods to characterize the effectiveness of current watermarking techniques. Our experiments, conducted across various datasets, reveal that current watermarking methods are detectable by even simple classifiers, challenging the notion of watermarking subtlety. We also found, through the LLM judger, that watermarking impacts text quality, especially in degrading the coherence and depth of the response. Our findings underscore the trade-off between watermark robustness and text quality and highlight the importance of having more informative metrics to assess watermarking quality. "

We demonstrate the benefits of this synthetic corruption informed pruning (SCIP) approach on the well-established HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, outperforming existing embedding-based methods.

However, previous methods typically regard videos as instructions, simply dividing them into action sequences for robotic repetition, which poses obstacles to generalization to diverse tasks or object instances. In this paper, we propose a different perspective, considering human demonstration videos not as mere instructions, but as a source of knowledge for robots. Motivated by this perspective and the remarkable comprehension and generalization capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs), we propose DigKnow, a method that DIstills Generalizable KNOWledge with a hierarchical structure. Specifically, DigKnow begins by converting human demonstration video frames into observation knowledge. This knowledge is then subjected to analysis to extract human action knowledge and further distilled into pattern knowledge compassing task and object instances, resulting in the acquisition of generalizable knowledge with a hierarchical structure. In settings with different tasks or object instances, DigKnow retrieves relevant knowledge for the current task and object instances. Subsequently, the LLM-based planner conducts planning based on the retrieved knowledge, and the policy executes actions in line with the plan to achieve the designated task. Utilizing the retrieved knowledge, we validate and rectify planning and execution outcomes, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the success rate. Experimental results across a range of tasks and scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating real-world robots to accomplish tasks with the knowledge derived from human demonstrations.

However, LLMs under Scaling-Inputs tend to be overly sensitive to inputs, leading to misinterpretation or non-compliance with instructions. Conversely, Scaling Input-Free Tasks demands a substantial number of tasks but is less effective in instruction following when dealing with instances in Scaling-Inputs. This work introduces MUFFIN, a new scheme of instruction-following dataset curation. Specifically, we automatically Scale Tasks per Input by diversifying these tasks with various input facets.

While effective for logical tasks, CoT is not conducive to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and is crucial for innovation advancements. In this paper, we explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) abilities within LLMs -- a non-sequential, creative paradigm involving strong associations and knowledge leaps. To this end, we study LLMs on the popular Oogiri game which needs participants to have good creativity and strong associative thinking for responding unexpectedly and humorously to the given image, text, or both, and thus is suitable for LoT study. Then to investigate LLMs' LoT ability in the Oogiri game, we first build a multimodal and multilingual Oogiri-GO dataset which contains over 130,000 samples from the Oogiri game, and observe the insufficient LoT ability or failures of most existing LLMs on the Oogiri game. Accordingly, we introduce a creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability. CLoT first formulates the Oogiri-GO dataset into LoT-oriented instruction tuning data to train pretrained LLM for achieving certain LoT humor generation and discrimination abilities. Then CLoT designs an explorative self-refinement that encourages the LLM to generate more creative LoT data via exploring parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts and selects high-quality data to train itself for self-refinement. CLoT not only excels in humor generation in the Oogiri game but also boosts creative abilities in various tasks like cloud guessing game and divergent association task.

Since LLMs are designed for natural language tasks, existing recommendation approaches have predominantly transformed recommendation tasks into open-domain natural language generation tasks. However, this approach necessitates items to possess rich semantic information, often generates out-of-range results, and suffers from notably low efficiency and limited extensibility. Furthermore, practical ID-based recommendation strategies, reliant on a huge number of unique identities (IDs) to represent users and items, have gained prominence in real-world recommender systems due to their effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the incapacity of LLMs to model IDs presents a formidable challenge when seeking to leverage LLMs for personalized recommendations. In this paper, we introduce an Elegant Effective Efficient Extensible solution for large language models for Sequential Recommendation (E4SRec), which seamlessly integrates LLMs with traditional recommender systems that exclusively utilize IDs to represent items. Specifically, E4SRec takes ID sequences as inputs, ensuring that the generated outputs fall within the candidate lists. Furthermore, E4SRec possesses the capability to generate the entire ranking list in a single forward process, and demands only a minimal set of pluggable parameters, which are trained for each dataset while keeping the entire LLM frozen.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in exploring the potential of LLMs for sequential recommendation by framing it as a language modeling task. Prior works represent items in the textual prompts using either ID indexing or text indexing and feed the prompts into LLMs, but falling short of either encapsulating comprehensive world knowledge or exhibiting sufficient sequential understanding. To harness the complementary strengths of traditional recommenders (which encode user behavioral knowledge) and LLMs (which possess world knowledge about items), we propose LLaRA -- a Large Language and Recommendation Assistant framework. Specifically, LLaRA represents items in LLM's input prompts using a novel hybrid approach that integrates ID-based item embeddings from traditional recommenders with textual item features. Viewing the ``sequential behavior of the user'' as a new modality in recommendation, we employ an adapter to bridge the modality gap between ID embeddings of the traditional recommenders and the input space of LLMs. Furthermore, instead of directly exposing the hybrid prompt to LLMs, we apply a curriculum learning approach to gradually ramp up training complexity. We first warm up the LLM with text-only prompting, which aligns more naturally with the LLM's language modeling capabilities. Thereafter, we progressively transition to hybrid prompting, training the adapter to incorporate behavioral knowledge from the traditional sequential recommender into the LLM.

However, the high-dimensional spatial-temporal data of a complex combustion system typically poses considerable challenges to the dynamical mode recognition. Based on a two-layer bidirectional long short-term memory variational autoencoder (Bi-LSTM-VAE) dimensionality reduction model and a two-dimensional Wasserstein distance-based classifier (WDC), this study proposes a promising method (Bi-LSTM-VAE-WDC) for recognizing dynamical modes in oscillatory combustion systems. Specifically, the Bi-LSTM-VAE dimension reduction model was introduced to reduce the high-dimensional spatial-temporal data of the combustion system to a low-dimensional phase space; Gaussian kernel density estimates (GKDE) were computed based on the distribution of phase points in a grid; two-dimensional WD values were calculated from the GKDE maps to recognize the oscillation modes. The time-series data used in this study were obtained from numerical simulations of circular arrays of laminar flame oscillators. The results show that the novel Bi-LSTM-VAE method can produce a non-overlapping distribution of phase points, indicating an effective unsupervised mode recognition and classification.

Given the observation that humans perform creative tasks with the help of imagination, we propose a class of solutions for creative agents, where the controller is enhanced with an imaginator that generates detailed imaginations of task outcomes conditioned on language instructions.

To this end, we propose an anime figures dataset RetriBooru-V1, with enhanced identity and clothing labels. We state new tasks enabled by this dataset, and introduce a new diversity metric to measure success in completing these tasks, quantifying the flexibility of image generations. We establish an RAG-inspired baseline method, designed to retrieve precise conditional information from reference images. Then, we compare with current methods on existing task to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. Finally, we provide baseline experiment results on new tasks, and conduct ablation studies on the possible structural choices. "

        "abstract": "With the growing volume of diverse information, the demand for classifying arbitrary topics has become increasingly critical. To address this challenge, we introduce DRAFT, a simple framework designed to train a classifier for few-shot topic classification. DRAFT uses a few examples of a specific topic as queries to construct Customized dataset with a dense retriever model. Multi-query retrieval (MQR) algorithm, which effectively handles multiple queries related to a specific topic, is applied to construct the Customized dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tune a classifier using the Customized dataset to identify the topic. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conduct evaluations on both widely used classification benchmark datasets and manually constructed datasets with 291 diverse topics, which simulate diverse contents encountered in real-world applications. DRAFT shows competitive or superior performance compared to baselines that use in-context learning, such as GPT-3 175B and InstructGPT 175B, on few-shot topic classification tasks despite having 177 times fewer parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness.

        "abstract": "Dense retrieval methods have been mostly focused on unstructured text and less attention has been drawn to structured data with various aspects, e.g., products with aspects such as category and brand. Recent work has proposed two approaches to incorporate the aspect information into item representations for effective retrieval by predicting the values associated with the item aspects. Despite their efficacy, they treat the values as isolated classes (e.g., \"Smart Homes\", \"Home, Garden & Tools\", and \"Beauty & Health\") and ignore their fine-grained semantic relation. Furthermore, they either enforce the learning of aspects into the CLS token, which could confuse it from its designated use for representing the entire content semantics, or learn extra aspect embeddings only with the value prediction objective, which could be insufficient especially when there are no annotated values for an item aspect. Aware of these limitations, we propose a MUlti-granulaRity-aware Aspect Learning model (MURAL) for multi-aspect dense retrieval. It leverages aspect information across various granularities to capture both coarse and fine-grained semantic relations between values. Moreover, MURAL incorporates separate aspect embeddings as input to transformer encoders so that the masked language model objective can assist implicit aspect learning even without aspect-value annotations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets of products and mini-programs show that MURAL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly. "

        "abstract": "Remote sensing segmentation has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, and urban change detection, etc. Despite the success of deep learning-based remote sensing segmentation methods (e.g., CNN and Transformer), they are not flexible enough to model irregular objects. In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods. "

        "abstract": "Although vision models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) show impressive generalization performance, their zero-shot robustness is still limited under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios without fine-tuning. Instead of undesirably providing human supervision as commonly done, it is possible to take advantage of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that hold powerful visual understanding abilities. However, MLLMs are shown to struggle with vision problems due to the incompatibility of tasks, thus hindering their utilization. In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs to conduct Machine Vision Therapy which aims to rectify the noisy predictions from vision models. By fine-tuning with the denoised labels, the learning model performance can be boosted in an unsupervised manner. To solve the incompatibility issue, we propose a novel Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to align vision tasks with MLLMs. Concretely, by estimating a transition matrix that captures the probability of one class being confused with another, an instruction containing a correct exemplar and an erroneous one from the most probable noisy class can be constructed. Such an instruction can help any MLLMs with ICL ability to detect and rectify incorrect predictions of vision models. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed, and other OOD datasets, we carefully validate the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our method.

We introduce GeNIe which leverages a diffusion model conditioned on a text prompt to merge contrasting data points (an image from the source category and a text prompt from the target category) to generate challenging samples for the target category. Inspired by recent image editing methods, we limit the number of diffusion iterations and the amount of noise. This ensures that the generated image retains low-level and contextual features from the source image, potentially conflicting with the target category. Our extensive experiments, in few-shot and also long-tail distribution settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel augmentation method, especially benefiting categories with a limited number of examples.

We demonstrate this by showing that the residual stream of only a single token can be linearly decoded to faithfully reconstruct the entire maze. We also find that the learned embeddings of individual tokens have spatial structure.

In this work we investigate the possibility of addressing the issue with vocabulary substitution in the context of LLaMa Russian language adaptation. We explore three variants of vocabulary adaptation and test their performance on Saiga instruction-tuning and fine-tuning on Russian Super Glue benchmark. The results of automatic evaluation show that vocabulary substitution not only improves the model's quality in Russian but also accelerates fine-tuning (35%) and inference (up to 60%) while reducing memory consumption. Additional human evaluation of the instruction-tuned models demonstrates that models with Russian-adapted vocabulary generate answers with higher user preference than the original Saiga-LLaMa model.

As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.

Since diffusion models have recently emerged as the de facto standard generative framework with surprising generation results, novelty detection via diffusion models has also gained much attention. Recent methods have mainly utilized the reconstruction property of in-distribution samples. However, they often suffer from detecting OOD samples that share similar background information to the in-distribution data. Based on our observation that diffusion models can \\emph{project} any sample to an in-distribution sample with similar background information, we propose \\emph{Projection Regret (PR)}, an efficient novelty detection method that mitigates the bias of non-semantic information. To be specific, PR computes the perceptual distance between the test image and its diffusion-based projection to detect abnormality. Since the perceptual distance often fails to capture semantic changes when the background information is dominant, we cancel out the background bias by comparing it against recursive projections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PR outperforms the prior art of generative-model-based novelty detection methods by a significant margin. "

Notably, existing image detectors for generated images encounter challenges such as low accuracy and limited generalization. This paper seeks to address this issue by seeking a representation with strong generalization capabilities to enhance the detection of generated images. Our investigation has revealed that real and generated images display distinct latent Gaussian representations when subjected to an inverse diffusion process within a pre-trained diffusion model. Exploiting this disparity, we can amplify subtle artifacts in generated images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel image representation known as Diffusion Noise Feature (DNF). DNF is an ensemble representation that estimates the noise generated during the inverse diffusion process. A simple classifier, e.g., ResNet, trained on DNF achieves high accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities for detecting generated images, even from previously unseen classes or models.

Learnable task prompts are introduced to push the general feature representations extracted by the encoder toward task-specific spaces, endowing the decoder with task awareness. Moreover, the model training is uniformly aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between the generated and ground-truth images regardless of the inhomogeneity among tasks. Experiments are conducted on three pixel-level OCR tasks including text removal, text segmentation, and tampered text detection.

Most of the existing point cloud upsampling methods focus on sparse point cloud feature extraction and upsampling module design. In a different way, we dive deeper into directly modelling the gradient of data distribution from dense point clouds. In this paper, we proposed a conditional denoising diffusion probability model (DDPM) for point cloud upsampling, called PUDM. Specifically, PUDM treats the sparse point cloud as a condition, and iteratively learns the transformation relationship between the dense point cloud and the noise. Simultaneously, PUDM aligns with a dual mapping paradigm to further improve the discernment of point features. In this context, PUDM enables learning complex geometry details in the ground truth through the dominant features, while avoiding an additional upsampling module design. Furthermore, to generate high-quality arbitrary-scale point clouds during inference, PUDM exploits the prior knowledge of the scale between sparse point clouds and dense point clouds during training by parameterizing a rate factor. Moreover, PUDM exhibits strong noise robustness in experimental results. In the quantitative and qualitative evaluations on PU1K and PUGAN, PUDM significantly outperformed existing methods in terms of Chamfer Distance (CD) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), achieving state of the art (SOTA) performance.

Given an arbitrary view and two sets of scene images captured at different timestamps, we can predict the scene changes in that view, which has significant potential applications in scene monitoring and measuring. We conducted preliminary studies and found that such an exciting task cannot be easily achieved by utilizing existing NeRFs and 2D change detection methods with many false or missing detections. The main reason is that the 2D change detection is based on the pixel appearance difference between spatial-aligned image pairs and neglects the stereo information in the NeRF. To address the limitations, we propose the C-NERF to represent scene changes as directional consistency difference-based NeRF, which mainly contains three modules. We first perform the spatial alignment of two NeRFs captured before and after changes. Then, we identify the change points based on the direction-consistent constraint; that is, real change points have similar change representations across view directions, but fake change points do not. Finally, we design the change map rendering process based on the built NeRFs and can generate the change map of an arbitrarily specified view direction. To validate the effectiveness, we build a new dataset containing ten scenes covering diverse scenarios with different changing objects.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02783",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, are creating significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g., reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data are associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data are paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graph scenarios (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-rich graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we mention the real-world applications of such methods and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future research directions in this fast-growing field. The related source can be found at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Awesome-Language-Model-on-Graphs. "

        "abstract": "We propose an auditing method to identify whether a large language model (LLM) encodes patterns such as hallucinations in its internal states, which may propagate to downstream tasks. We introduce a weakly supervised auditing technique using a subset scanning approach to detect anomalous patterns in LLM activations from pre-trained models. Importantly, our method does not need knowledge of the type of patterns a-priori. Instead, it relies on a reference dataset devoid of anomalies during testing. Further, our approach enables the identification of pivotal nodes responsible for encoding these patterns, which may offer crucial insights for fine-tuning specific sub-networks for bias mitigation. We introduce two new scanning methods to handle LLM activations for anomalous sentences that may deviate from the expected distribution in either direction. Our results confirm prior findings of BERT's limited internal capacity for encoding hallucinations, while OPT appears capable of encoding hallucination information internally. Importantly, our scanning approach, without prior exposure to false statements, performs comparably to a fully supervised out-of-distribution classifier. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02813",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models have made tremendous progress in text-driven image and video generation. Now text-to-image foundation models are widely applied to various downstream image synthesis tasks, such as controllable image generation and image editing, while downstream video synthesis tasks are less explored for several reasons. First, it requires huge memory and compute overhead to train a video generation foundation model. Even with video foundation models, additional costly training is still required for downstream video synthesis tasks. Second, although some works extend image diffusion models into videos in a training-free manner, temporal consistency cannot be well kept. Finally, these adaption methods are specifically designed for one task and fail to generalize to different downstream video synthesis tasks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework, coined as BIVDiff, via bridging specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically, we first use an image diffusion model (like ControlNet, Instruct Pix2Pix) for frame-wise video generation, then perform Mixed Inversion on the generated video, and finally input the inverted latents into the video diffusion model for temporal smoothing. Decoupling image and video models enables flexible image model selection for different purposes, which endows the framework with strong task generalization and high efficiency. To validate the effectiveness and general use of BIVDiff, we perform a wide range of video generation tasks, including controllable video generation video editing, video inpainting and outpainting.

        "abstract": "Weather forecasting requires not only accuracy but also the ability to perform probabilistic prediction. However, deterministic weather forecasting methods do not support probabilistic predictions, and conversely, probabilistic models tend to be less accurate. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the \\textbf{\\textit{D}}eterministic \\textbf{\\textit{G}}uidance \\textbf{\\textit{D}}iffusion \\textbf{\\textit{M}}odel (DGDM) for probabilistic weather forecasting, integrating benefits of both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. During the forward process, both the deterministic and probabilistic models are trained end-to-end. In the reverse process, weather forecasting leverages the predicted result from the deterministic model, using as an intermediate starting point for the probabilistic model. By fusing deterministic models with probabilistic models in this manner, DGDM is capable of providing accurate forecasts while also offering probabilistic predictions. To evaluate DGDM, we assess it on the global weather forecasting dataset (WeatherBench) and the common video frame prediction benchmark (Moving MNIST). We also introduce and evaluate the Pacific Northwest Windstorm (PNW)-Typhoon weather satellite dataset to verify the effectiveness of DGDM in high-resolution regional forecasting. As a result of our experiments, DGDM achieves state-of-the-art results not only in global forecasting but also in regional forecasting.

        "abstract": "Detecting the objects in dense and rotated scenes is a challenging task. Recent works on this topic are mostly based on Faster RCNN or Retinanet. As they are highly dependent on the pre-set dense anchors and the NMS operation, the approach is indirect and suboptimal.The end-to-end DETR-based detectors have achieved great success in horizontal object detection and many other areas like segmentation, tracking, action recognition and etc.However, the DETR-based detectors perform poorly on dense rotated target tasks and perform worse than most modern CNN-based detectors. In this paper, we find the most significant reason for the poor performance is that the original attention can not accurately focus on the oriented targets. Accordingly, we propose Rotated object detection TRansformer (RotaTR) as an extension of DETR to oriented detection. Specifically, we design Rotation Sensitive deformable (RSDeform) attention to enhance the DETR's ability to detect oriented targets. It is used to build the feature alignment module and rotation-sensitive decoder for our model. We test RotaTR on four challenging-oriented benchmarks. It shows a great advantage in detecting dense and oriented objects compared to the original DETR. It also achieves competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art. "

        "abstract": "With the advent of deep learning, progressively larger neural networks have been designed to solve complex tasks. We take advantage of these capacity-rich models to lower the cost of inference by exploiting computation in superposition. To reduce the computational burden per input, we propose Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks (MIMONets) capable of handling many inputs at once. MIMONets augment various deep neural network architectures with variable binding mechanisms to represent an arbitrary number of inputs in a compositional data structure via fixed-width distributed representations. Accordingly, MIMONets adapt nonlinear neural transformations to process the data structure holistically, leading to a speedup nearly proportional to the number of superposed input items in the data structure. After processing in superposition, an unbinding mechanism recovers each transformed input of interest. MIMONets also provide a dynamic trade-off between accuracy and throughput by an instantaneous on-demand switching between a set of accuracy-throughput operating points, yet within a single set of fixed parameters. We apply the concept of MIMONets to both CNN and Transformer architectures resulting in MIMOConv and MIMOFormer, respectively. Empirical evaluations show that MIMOConv achieves about 2-4 x speedup at an accuracy delta within [+0.68, -3.18]% compared to WideResNet CNNs on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Similarly, MIMOFormer can handle 2-4 inputs at once while maintaining a high average accuracy within a [-1.07, -3.43]% delta on the long range arena benchmark. Finally, we provide mathematical bounds on the interference between superposition channels in MIMOFormer. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/multiple-input-multiple-output-nets. "

        "abstract": "The process engineering domain widely uses Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) to represent process flows and equipment configurations. However, the P&IDs and PFDs, hereafter called flowsheets, can contain errors causing safety hazards, inefficient operation, and unnecessary expenses. Correcting and verifying flowsheets is a tedious, manual process. We propose a novel generative AI methodology for automatically identifying errors in flowsheets and suggesting corrections to the user, i.e., autocorrecting flowsheets. Inspired by the breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) for grammatical autocorrection of human language, we investigate LLMs for the autocorrection of flowsheets. The input to the model is a potentially erroneous flowsheet and the output of the model are suggestions for a corrected flowsheet. We train our autocorrection model on a synthetic dataset in a supervised manner. The model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 80% and a top-5 accuracy of 84% on an independent test dataset of synthetically generated flowsheets. The results suggest that the model can learn to autocorrect the synthetic flowsheets. We envision that flowsheet autocorrection will become a useful tool for chemical engineers. "

Utilizing BenchLMM, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs and reveal: 1) LMMs generally suffer performance degradation when working with other styles; 2) An LMM performs better than another model in common style does not guarantee its superior performance in other styles; 3) LMMs' reasoning capability can be enhanced by prompting LMMs to predict the style first, based on which we propose a versatile and training-free method for improving LMMs; 4) An intelligent LMM is expected to interpret the causes of its errors when facing stylistic variations. We hope that our benchmark and analysis can shed new light on developing more intelligent and versatile LMMs. "

        "abstract": "Conversational question-answering (CQA) systems aim to create interactive search systems that effectively retrieve information by interacting with users. To replicate human-to-human conversations, existing work uses human annotators to play the roles of the questioner (student) and the answerer (teacher). Despite its effectiveness, challenges exist as human annotation is time-consuming, inconsistent, and not scalable. To address this issue and investigate the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in CQA simulation, we propose a simulation framework that employs zero-shot learner LLMs for simulating teacher-student interactions. Our framework involves two LLMs interacting on a specific topic, with the first LLM acting as a student, generating questions to explore a given search topic. The second LLM plays the role of a teacher by answering questions and is equipped with additional information, including a text on the given topic. We implement both the student and teacher by zero-shot prompting the GPT-4 model. To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating CQA interactions and understand the disparities between LLM- and human-generated conversations, we evaluate the simulated data from various perspectives. We begin by evaluating the teacher's performance through both automatic and human assessment. Next, we evaluate the performance of the student, analyzing and comparing the disparities between questions generated by the LLM and those generated by humans. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analyses to thoroughly examine the LLM performance by benchmarking state-of-the-art reading comprehension models on both datasets. Our results reveal that the teacher LLM generates lengthier answers that tend to be more accurate and complete. The student LLM generates more diverse questions, covering more aspects of a given topic. "

        "abstract": "Despite substantial progress, all-in-one image restoration (IR) grapples with persistent challenges in handling intricate real-world degradations. This paper introduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that harnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, we develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for holistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both prompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image encoder, enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover, a plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct encoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method, MPerceiver is trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific methods across most tasks. Post multitask pre-training, MPerceiver attains a generalized representation in low-level vision, exhibiting remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks. Extensive experiments on 16 IR tasks and 26 benchmarks underscore the superiority of MPerceiver in terms of adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity. "

Towards such a challenge, this work presents a practical system, named LivePhoto, which allows users to animate an image of their interest with text descriptions. We first establish a strong baseline that helps a well-learned text-to-image generator (i.e., Stable Diffusion) take an image as a further input. We then equip the improved generator with a motion module for temporal modeling and propose a carefully designed training pipeline to better link texts and motions. In particular, considering the facts that (1) text can only describe motions roughly (e.g., regardless of the moving speed) and (2) text may include both content and motion descriptions, we introduce a motion intensity estimation module as well as a text re-weighting module to reduce the ambiguity of text-to-motion mapping. Empirical evidence suggests that our approach is capable of well decoding motion-related textual instructions into videos, such as actions, camera movements, or even conjuring new contents from thin air (e.g., pouring water into an empty glass). Interestingly, thanks to the proposed intensity learning mechanism, our system offers users an additional control signal (i.e., the motion intensity) besides text for video customization. "

The method, however, differs from the earlier variants as the definition of the low order equation, which is adjusted according to the zeroth and first moments of the Boltzmann Fokker Planck equation. For the problems considered, we observe that the NDA-accelerated solution follows the unaccelerated well and provides roughly an order of magnitude savings in iteration count and runtime compared to source iteration.

Due to the limitations in diversity and challenges in handling lighting conditions, traditional rendering-based methods are increasingly being supplanted by diffusion-based methods. However, a significant challenge in diffusion-based methods is ensuring that the generated sensor data preserve both intra-world consistency and inter-sensor coherence. To address these challenges, we combine an additional explicit world volume and propose the World Volume-aware Multi-camera Driving Scene Generator (WoVoGen). This system is specifically designed to leverage 4D world volume as a foundational element for video generation. Our model operates in two distinct phases: (i) envisioning the future 4D temporal world volume based on vehicle control sequences, and (ii) generating multi-camera videos, informed by this envisioned 4D temporal world volume and sensor interconnectivity. The incorporation of the 4D world volume empowers WoVoGen not only to generate high-quality street-view videos in response to vehicle control inputs but also to facilitate scene editing tasks. "

Existing methods for video editing mainly focus on changing the appearance or style of the objects in the video, while keeping their structures unchanged. However, there is no existing method that allows users to interactively ``drag'' any points of instances on the first frame to precisely reach the target points with other frames consistently deformed. In this paper, we propose a new diffusion-based method for interactive point-based video manipulation, called Drag-A-Video. Our method allows users to click pairs of handle points and target points as well as masks on the first frame of an input video. Then, our method transforms the inputs into point sets and propagates these sets across frames. To precisely modify the contents of the video, we employ a new video-level motion supervision to update the features of the video and introduce the latent offsets to achieve this update at multiple denoising timesteps. We propose a temporal-consistent point tracking module to coordinate the movement of the points in the handle point sets.

However, in the realm of 3D vision, while remarkable progress has been made with models trained on large-scale synthetic and real-captured object data like Objaverse and MVImgNet, a similar level of progress has not been observed in the domain of human-centric tasks partially due to the lack of a large-scale human dataset. Existing datasets of high-fidelity 3D human capture continue to be mid-sized due to the significant challenges in acquiring large-scale high-quality 3D human data. To bridge this gap, we present MVHumanNet, a dataset that comprises multi-view human action sequences of 4,500 human identities. The primary focus of our work is on collecting human data that features a large number of diverse identities and everyday clothing using a multi-view human capture system, which facilitates easily scalable data collection.

This task takes in image sets $D_A$ and $D_B$, and outputs a description that is more often true on $D_A$ than $D_B$. We outline a two-stage approach that first proposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks the candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We introduce VisDiff, which first captions the images and prompts a language model to propose candidate descriptions, then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP. To evaluate VisDiff, we collect VisDiffBench, a dataset with 187 paired image sets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various domains, such as comparing datasets (e.g., ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2), comparing classification models (e.g., zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet), summarizing model failure modes (supervised ResNet), characterizing differences between generative models (e.g., StableDiffusionV1 and V2), and discovering what makes images memorable.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02980",
        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have excelled in 2D image-text comprehension and image generation, but their understanding of the 3D world is notably deficient, limiting progress in 3D language understanding and generation. To solve this problem, we introduce GPT4Point, an innovative groundbreaking point-language multimodal model designed specifically for unified 3D object understanding and generation within the MLLM framework. GPT4Point as a powerful 3D MLLM seamlessly can execute a variety of point-text reference tasks such as point-cloud captioning and Q&A. Additionally, GPT4Point is equipped with advanced capabilities for controllable 3D generation, it can get high-quality results through a low-quality point-text feature maintaining the geometric shapes and colors. To support the expansive needs of 3D object-text pairs, we develop Pyramid-XL, a point-language dataset annotation engine. It constructs a large-scale database over 1M objects of varied text granularity levels from the Objaverse-XL dataset, essential for training GPT4Point. A comprehensive benchmark has been proposed to evaluate 3D point-language understanding capabilities. In extensive evaluations, GPT4Point has demonstrated superior performance in understanding and generation. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02981",
        "abstract": "3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) excel at rendering photorealistic novel views of complex scenes. However, recovering a high-quality NeRF typically requires tens to hundreds of input images, resulting in a time-consuming capture process. We present ReconFusion to reconstruct real-world scenes using only a few photos. Our approach leverages a diffusion prior for novel view synthesis, trained on synthetic and multiview datasets, which regularizes a NeRF-based 3D reconstruction pipeline at novel camera poses beyond those captured by the set of input images. Our method synthesizes realistic geometry and texture in underconstrained regions while preserving the appearance of observed regions. We perform an extensive evaluation across various real-world datasets, including forward-facing and 360-degree scenes, demonstrating significant performance improvements over previous few-view NeRF reconstruction approaches.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02298",
        "abstract": "Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a vital role in time series analysis, such as signal classification and identification within wireless communications. Deep learning-based AMC models have demonstrated significant potential in this domain. However, current AMC models inadequately consider the disparities in handling signals under conditions of low and high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), resulting in an unevenness in their performance. In this study, we propose MoE-AMC, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based model specifically crafted to address AMC in a well-balanced manner across varying SNR conditions. Utilizing the MoE framework, MoE-AMC seamlessly combines the strengths of LSRM (a Transformer-based model) for handling low SNR signals and HSRM (a ResNet-based model) for high SNR signals. This integration empowers MoE-AMC to achieve leading performance in modulation classification, showcasing its efficacy in capturing distinctive signal features under diverse SNR scenarios. We conducted experiments using the RML2018.01a dataset, where MoE-AMC achieved an average classification accuracy of 71.76% across different SNR levels, surpassing the performance of previous SOTA models by nearly 10%. This study represents a pioneering application of MoE techniques in the realm of AMC, offering a promising avenue for elevating signal classification accuracy within wireless communication systems. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02430",
        "abstract": "The 2021 paper \"Control barrier functions for stochastic systems\" provides theorems that give almost sure safety guarantees given stochastic zero control barrier function (ZCBF). Unfortunately, both the theorem and its proof is invalid. In this letter, we illustrate on a toy example that the almost sure safety guarantees for stochastic ZCBF do not hold and explain why the proof is flawed. Although stochastic reciprocal barrier functions (RCBF) also uses the same proof technique, we provide a different proof technique that verifies that stochastic RCBFs are indeed safe with probability one. Using the RCBF, we derive a modified ZCBF condition that guarantees safety with probability one. Finally, we provide some discussion on the role of unbounded controls in the almost-sure safety guarantees of RCBFs, and show that the rate of divergence of the ratio of the drift and diffusion is the key for whether a system has almost sure safety guarantees.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02683",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models are a new class of generative models that have recently been applied to speech enhancement successfully. Previous works have demonstrated their superior performance in mismatched conditions compared to state-of-the art discriminative models. However, this was investigated with a single database for training and another one for testing, which makes the results highly dependent on the particular databases. Moreover, recent developments from the image generation literature remain largely unexplored for speech enhancement. These include several design aspects of diffusion models, such as the noise schedule or the reverse sampler. In this work, we systematically assess the generalization performance of a diffusion-based speech enhancement model by using multiple speech, noise and binaural room impulse response (BRIR) databases to simulate mismatched acoustic conditions. We also experiment with a noise schedule and a sampler that have not been applied to speech enhancement before. We show that the proposed system substantially benefits from using multiple databases for training, and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art discriminative models in both matched and mismatched conditions. We also show that a Heun-based sampler achieves superior performance at a smaller computational cost compared to a sampler commonly used for speech enhancement. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02753",
        "abstract": "Most neural compression models are trained on large datasets of images or videos in order to generalize to unseen data. Such generalization typically requires large and expressive architectures with a high decoding complexity. Here we introduce C3, a neural compression method with strong rate-distortion (RD) performance that instead overfits a small model to each image or video separately. The resulting decoding complexity of C3 can be an order of magnitude lower than neural baselines with similar RD performance. C3 builds on COOL-CHIC (Ladune et al.) and makes several simple and effective improvements for images. We further develop new methodology to apply C3 to videos. On the CLIC2020 image benchmark, we match the RD performance of VTM, the reference implementation of the H.266 codec, with less than 3k MACs/pixel for decoding. On the UVG video benchmark, we match the RD performance of the Video Compression Transformer (Mentzer et al.), a well-established neural video codec, with less than 5k MACs/pixel for decoding. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02786",
        "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most critical greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, contributing to 16-25% of the observed atmospheric warming. Wetlands are the primary natural source of methane emissions globally. However, wetland methane emission estimates from biogeochemistry models contain considerable uncertainty. One of the main sources of this uncertainty arises from the numerous uncertain model parameters within various physical, biological, and chemical processes that influence methane production, oxidation, and transport. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) can help identify critical parameters for methane emission and achieve reduced biases and uncertainties in future projections. This study performs SA for 19 selected parameters responsible for critical biogeochemical processes in the methane module of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM). The impact of these parameters on various CH4 fluxes is examined at 14 FLUXNET- CH4 sites with diverse vegetation types. Given the extensive number of model simulations needed for global variance-based SA, we employ a machine learning (ML) algorithm to emulate the complex behavior of ELM methane biogeochemistry. ML enables the computational time to be shortened significantly from 6 CPU hours to 0.72 milliseconds, achieving reduced computational costs. We found that parameters linked to CH4 production and diffusion generally present the highest sensitivities despite apparent seasonal variation. Comparing simulated emissions from perturbed parameter sets against FLUXNET-CH4 observations revealed that better performances can be achieved at each site compared to the default parameter values. This presents a scope for further improving simulated emissions using parameter calibration with advanced optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization. "
