        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04597",
        "abstract": "As a key technology in 6G research, federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning among multiple clients while ensuring individual data privacy. However, malicious attackers among the participating clients can intentionally tamper with the training data or the trained model, compromising the accuracy and trustworthiness of the system. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical audit-based FL (HiAudit-FL) framework, with the aim to enhance the reliability and security of the learning process. The hierarchical audit process includes two stages, namely model-audit and parameter-audit. In the model-audit stage, a low-overhead audit method is employed to identify suspicious clients. Subsequently, in the parameter-audit stage, a resource-consuming method is used to detect all malicious clients with higher accuracy among the suspicious ones. Specifically, we execute the model audit method among partial clients for multiple rounds, which is modeled as a partial observation Markov decision process (POMDP) with the aim to enhance the robustness and accountability of the decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. Meanwhile, we formulate the problem of identifying malicious attackers through a multi-round audit as an active sequential hypothesis testing problem and leverage a diffusion model-based AI-Enabled audit selection strategy (ASS) to decide which clients should be audited in each round. To accomplish efficient and effective audit selection, we design a DRL-ASS algorithm by incorporating the ASS in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Our simulation results demonstrate that HiAudit-FL can effectively identify and handle potential malicious users accurately, with small system overhead. "

Our approach builds on two recent developments: surface reconstruction using neural radiance fields for the reconstruction of the visible parts of the surface, and guidance of pre-trained 2D diffusion models in the form of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to complete the shape in unobserved regions in a plausible manner. We introduce three components. First, we suggest employing normal maps as a pure geometric representation for SDS instead of color renderings which are entangled with the appearance information. Second, we introduce the freezing of the SDS noise during training which results in more coherent gradients and better convergence. Third, we propose Multi-View SDS as a way to condition the generation of the non-observable part of the surface without fine-tuning or making changes to the underlying 2D Stable Diffusion model. We evaluate our approach on the BlendedMVS dataset demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements over competing methods. "

The unCLIP stack comprises T2I prior and diffusion image decoder. The T2I prior model alone adds a billion parameters compared to the Latent Diffusion Models, which increases the computational and high-quality data requirements. We introduce ECLIPSE, a novel contrastive learning method that is both parameter and data-efficient. ECLIPSE leverages pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to distill the knowledge into the prior model. We demonstrate that the ECLIPSE trained prior, with only 3.3% of the parameters and trained on a mere 2.8% of the data, surpasses the baseline T2I priors with an average of 71.6% preference score under resource-limited setting. It also attains performance on par with SOTA big models, achieving an average of 63.36% preference score in terms of the ability to follow the text compositions. Extensive experiments on two unCLIP diffusion image decoders, Karlo and Kandinsky, affirm that ECLIPSE priors consistently deliver high performance while significantly reducing resource dependency. "

To design LLM prompts, one important setting, called demonstration selection, considers selecting demonstrations from an example bank. Existing methods use various heuristics for this selection, but for CoT prompting, which involves unique rationales, it is essential to base the selection upon the intrinsic skills that CoT rationales need, for instance, the skills of addition or subtraction for math word problems.

Current defense methods often struggle to provide robust protection without hurting model utility, and they often require retraining the model or using extra data. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against membership attacks by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to remove the differences between member and non-member inputs which can be used to perform membership attacks, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense works \\emph{pre-inference}, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time (modify the model) or post-inference time (modify the model's output). "

        "abstract": "With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in code generation, enabling LLMs to transform natural language into programming code. These Code LLMs have been widely accepted by massive users and organizations. However, a dangerous nature is hidden in the code, which is the existence of fatal vulnerabilities. While some LLM providers have attempted to address these issues by aligning with human guidance, these efforts fall short of making Code LLMs practical and robust. Without a deep understanding of the performance of the LLMs under the practical worst cases, it would be concerning to apply them to various real-world applications. In this paper, we answer the critical issue: Are existing Code LLMs immune to generating vulnerable code? If not, what is the possible maximum severity of this issue in practical deployment scenarios? In this paper, we introduce DeceptPrompt, a novel algorithm that can generate adversarial natural language instructions that drive the Code LLMs to generate functionality correct code with vulnerabilities. DeceptPrompt is achieved through a systematic evolution-based algorithm with a fine grain loss design. The unique advantage of DeceptPrompt enables us to find natural prefix/suffix with totally benign and non-directional semantic meaning, meanwhile, having great power in inducing the Code LLMs to generate vulnerable code. This feature can enable us to conduct the almost-worstcase red-teaming on these LLMs in a real scenario, where users are using natural language. Our extensive experiments and analyses on DeceptPrompt not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also shed light on the huge weakness of LLMs in the code generation task. When applying the optimized prefix/suffix, the attack success rate (ASR) will improve by average 50% compared with no prefix/suffix applying. "

Current visual instruction datasets, generated through large language models, focus on creating question/answer pairs for individual image patches, which may lack diagnostic capacity on their own in histopathology, further complicated by the absence of spatial grounding in histopathology image captions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Quilt-Instruct, a large-scale dataset of 107,131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs, that is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube, which provides spatial localization of captions by automatically extracting narrators' cursor movements. In addition, we provide contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire video content to guide the extrapolative reasoning of GPT-4.

To evaluate Quilt-LLaVA, we propose a comprehensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers.

To bridge this gap, we perform a comprehensive exploration of various poisoning techniques to assess their effectiveness across a range of generative tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a range of metrics designed to quantify the success and stealthiness of poisoning attacks specifically tailored to NLG tasks.

Furthermore, leveraging on the strong capability of foundation models (i.e., SAM and LLM), we propose to augment recipe and food image by extracting information related to the counterpart. SAM generates image segments corresponding to ingredients in the recipe, while LLM produces a visual imagination description from the recipe, aiming to capture the visual cues of a food image. In addition, we introduce circle loss to regulate cross-modal embedding space, which assigns different penalties for positive and negative pairs.

In our study, we reveal a new threat to LLM alignment when a bad actor has access to the model's output logits, a common feature in both open-source LLMs and many commercial LLM APIs (e.g., certain GPT models). It does not rely on crafting specific prompts. Instead, it exploits the fact that even when an LLM rejects a toxic request, a harmful response often hides deep in the output logits. By forcefully selecting lower-ranked output tokens during the auto-regressive generation process at a few critical output positions, we can compel the model to reveal these hidden responses. We term this process model interrogation. This approach differs from and outperforms jail-breaking methods, achieving 92% effectiveness compared to 62%, and is 10 to 20 times faster. The harmful content uncovered through our method is more relevant, complete, and clear. Additionally, it can complement jail-breaking strategies, with which results in further boosting attack performance.

ReCaLab is a fully-differentiable pipeline that learns high-fidelity 3D human avatars from just a single RGB video. A pose-conditioned deformable NeRF is optimized to volumetrically represent a human subject in canonical T-pose. The canonical representation is then leveraged to efficiently associate viewpoint-agnostic textures using 2D-3D correspondences. This enables to separately generate albedo and shading which jointly compose an RGB prediction. The design allows to control intermediate results for human pose, body shape, texture, and lighting with text prompts. An image-conditioned diffusion model thereby helps to animate appearance and pose of the 3D avatar to create video sequences with previously unseen human motion. Extensive experiments show that ReCaLab outperforms previous monocular approaches in terms of image quality for image synthesis tasks. ReCaLab even outperforms multi-view methods that leverage up to 19x more synchronized videos for the task of novel pose rendering.

Traditional image captioning methods often overlook the preferences and characteristics of users. Personalized image captioning solves this problem by incorporating user prior knowledge into the model, such as writing styles and preferred vocabularies. Most existing methods emphasize the user context fusion process by memory networks or transformers. However, these methods ignore the distinct domains of each dataset. Therefore, they need to update the entire caption model parameters when meeting new samples, which is time-consuming and calculation-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel personalized image captioning framework that leverages user context to consider personality factors. Additionally, our framework utilizes the prefix-tuning paradigm to extract knowledge from a frozen large language model, reducing the gap between different language domains. Specifically, we employ CLIP to extract the visual features of an image and align the semantic space using a query-guided mapping network. By incorporating the transformer layer, we merge the visual features with the user's contextual prior knowledge to generate informative prefixes. Moreover, we employ GPT-2 as the frozen large language model. With a small number of parameters to be trained, our model performs efficiently and effectively.

In this work, we propose MimicDiffusion, a new diffusion-based adversarial purification technique, that directly approximates the generative process of the diffusion model with the clean image as input. Concretely, we analyze the differences between the guided terms using the clean image and the adversarial sample. After that, we first implement MimicDiffusion based on Manhattan distance. Then, we propose two guidance to purify the adversarial perturbation and approximate the clean diffusion model. Extensive experiments on three image datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with three classifier backbones including WideResNet-70-16, WideResNet-28-10, and ResNet50 demonstrate that MimicDiffusion significantly performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we conduct an initial analysis of the publicly available Stable Diffusion model and its derivatives, highlighting the presence of racial stereotypes. These models often generate distorted or biased images for certain racial groups, emphasizing stereotypical characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a framework called \"RS-Corrector\", designed to establish an anti-stereotypical preference in the latent space and update the latent code for refined generated results. The correction process occurs during the inference stage without requiring fine-tuning of the original model. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that the introduced \\themodel effectively corrects the racial stereotypes of the well-trained Stable Diffusion model while leaving the original model unchanged.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a unified framework to simulate non-Newtonian behaviors. We combine viscous and elasto-plastic stress into a unified particle solver to achieve various non-Newtonian behaviors ranging from fluid-like to solid-like. Our constitutive model is based on a Generalized Maxwell model, which incorporates viscosity, elasticity and plasticity in one non-linear framework by a unified way. On the one hand, taking advantage of the viscous term, we construct a series of strain-rate dependent models for classical non-Newtonian behaviors such as shear-thickening, shear-thinning, Bingham plastic, etc. On the other hand, benefiting from the elasto-plastic model, we empower our framework with the ability to simulate solid-like non-Newtonian behaviors, i.e., visco-elasticity/plasticity. In addition, we enrich our method with a heat diffusion model to make our method flexible in simulating phase change. Through sufficient experiments, we demonstrate a wide range of non-Newtonian behaviors ranging from viscous fluid to deformable objects. We believe this non-Newtonian model will enhance the realism of physically-based animation, which has great potential for computer graphics. "

In this poster, we present a novel approach of using Program Knowledge Graph that is embedded with fine-grained execution information of the systems (e.g., callgraph, data-flow, etc.) along with information extracted from the public vulnerability and weakness datasets (e.g., CVE and CWE). We further demonstrate that our custom security knowledge graph can be checked against the standard queries generated by LLM, providing a powerful way to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in critical systems.

To address this issue, we propose a novel, unified framework that iteratively optimizes both the 3D model and the diffusion prior. Leveraging the different learnable parameters of the diffusion prior, our approach offers multiple configurations, affording various trade-offs between performance and implementation complexity. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that our method markedly surpasses existing techniques, establishing new state-of-the-art in the realm of text-to-3D generation. Furthermore, our approach exhibits impressive performance on both NeRF and the newly introduced 3D Gaussian Splatting backbones. Additionally, our framework yields insightful contributions to the understanding of recent score distillation methods, such as the VSD and DDS loss. "

        "abstract": "Entropy and mutual information in neural networks provide rich information on the learning process, but they have proven difficult to compute reliably in high dimensions. Indeed, in noisy and high-dimensional data, traditional estimates in ambient dimensions approach a fixed entropy and are prohibitively hard to compute. To address these issues, we leverage data geometry to access the underlying manifold and reliably compute these information-theoretic measures. Specifically, we define diffusion spectral entropy (DSE) in neural representations of a dataset as well as diffusion spectral mutual information (DSMI) between different variables representing data. First, we show that they form noise-resistant measures of intrinsic dimensionality and relationship strength in high-dimensional simulated data that outperform classic Shannon entropy, nonparametric estimation, and mutual information neural estimation (MINE). We then study the evolution of representations in classification networks with supervised learning, self-supervision, or overfitting. We observe that (1) DSE of neural representations increases during training; (2) DSMI with the class label increases during generalizable learning but stays stagnant during overfitting; (3) DSMI with the input signal shows differing trends: on MNIST it increases, while on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 it decreases. Finally, we show that DSE can be used to guide better network initialization and that DSMI can be used to predict downstream classification accuracy across 962 models on ImageNet.

However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations through fine-tuning or continued pretraining. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without exposing model parameters or interfering with training. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, showing negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. We make these invariant terms human-readable by mapping them to a Gaussian vector using a convolutional encoder and then converting it into a natural image with StyleGAN2. Our method generates a dog image as an identity fingerprint for an LLM, where the dog's appearance strongly indicates the LLM's base model. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, the generated dog image remains invariant to different training steps, including SFT, RLHF, or even continued pretraining with augmented vocabulary in a new language.

Our approach, Aligned Stable Inpainting with UnKnown Areas Prior (ASUKA), employs a reconstruction-based masked auto-encoder (MAE) as a stable prior. Aligned with the robust Stable Diffusion inpainting model (SD), ASUKA significantly improves inpainting stability. ASUKA further aligns masked and unmasked regions through an inpainting-specialized decoder, ensuring more faithful inpainting. To validate effectiveness across domains and masking scenarios, we evaluate on MISATO, a collection of several existing dataset. Results confirm ASUKA's efficacy in both stability and fidelity compared to SD and other inpainting algorithms. "

This capability is important not only to support reference-grounded VL benchmarks, but also, for practical applications that require precise within-image reasoning. We build Localized Visual Commonsense models, which allow users to specify (multiple) regions as input. We train our model by sampling localized commonsense knowledge from a large language model (LLM): specifically, we prompt an LLM to collect commonsense knowledge given a global literal image description and a local literal region description automatically generated by a set of VL models. With a separately trained critic model that selects high-quality examples, we find that training on the localized commonsense corpus can successfully distill existing VL models to support a reference-as-input interface. Empirical results and human evaluations in a zero-shot setup demonstrate that our distillation method results in more precise VL models of reasoning compared to a baseline of passing a generated referring expression to an LLM.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on seven benchmark datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods.

Through this approach, we have achieved competitive or even better results while maintaining extremely low resource consumption across six change detection benchmarks. For example, training time on LEVIR-CD, a change detection benchmark, is only half an hour with 9 GB memory usage, which could be very convenient for most researchers. Additionally, the decoupled tuning framework can be extended to any pretrained model for semantic change detection and multi temporal change detection as well. We hope that our proposed approach will serve as a part of foundational model to inspire more unified training approaches on change detection in the future. "

We pair this representation with a diffusion model, MVDD, that is capable of generating high-quality dense point clouds with 20K+ points with fine-grained details. To enforce 3D consistency in multi-view depth, we introduce an epipolar line segment attention that conditions the denoising step for a view on its neighboring views. Additionally, a depth fusion module is incorporated into diffusion steps to further ensure the alignment of depth maps. When augmented with surface reconstruction, MVDD can also produce high-quality 3D meshes. Furthermore, MVDD stands out in other tasks such as depth completion, and can serve as a 3D prior, significantly boosting many downstream tasks, such as GAN inversion. State-of-the-art results from extensive experiments demonstrate MVDD's excellent ability in 3D shape generation, depth completion, and its potential as a 3D prior for downstream tasks. "

Although these image synthesis methods produce visually appealing results, they frequently exhibit spelling errors when rendering text within the generated images.

To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a novel approach for text image generation, utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion [27]). Our approach involves the design and training of a light-weight character-level text encoder, which replaces the original CLIP encoder and provides more robust text embeddings as conditional guidance. Then, we fine-tune the diffusion model using a large-scale dataset, incorporating local attention control under the supervision of character-level segmentation maps. Finally, by employing an inference stage refinement process, we achieve a notably high sequence accuracy when synthesizing text in arbitrarily given images. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.

We propose a new cross-modal BERT-style self-supervised learning paradigm, called Cross-BERT. To facilitate pretraining for irregular and sparse point clouds, we design two self-supervised tasks to boost cross-modal interaction.

The second task, termed Masked Cross-modal Modeling, further improves mask modeling of BERT by incorporating high-dimensional semantic information obtained by cross-modal interaction. By performing cross-modal interaction, Cross-BERT can smoothly reconstruct the masked tokens during pretraining, leading to notable performance enhancements for downstream tasks. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that Cross-BERT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D downstream applications.

Considering the complexity of the quality distribution of both real and fake faces, we propose a novel Deepfake detection framework named DeepFidelity to adaptively distinguish real and fake faces with varying image quality by mining the perceptual forgery fidelity of face images. Specifically, we improve the model's ability to identify complex samples by mapping real and fake face data of different qualities to different scores to distinguish them in a more detailed way. In addition, we propose a network structure called Symmetric Spatial Attention Augmentation based vision Transformer (SSAAFormer), which uses the symmetry of face images to promote the network to model the geographic long-distance relationship at the shallow level and augment local features.

To address the above issues, we start by asking ourselves if the inversion process can be eliminated for editing. We show that when the initial sample is known, a special variance schedule reduces the denoising step to the same form as the multi-step consistency sampling. We name this Denoising Diffusion Consistent Model (DDCM), and note that it implies a virtual inversion strategy without explicit inversion in sampling. We further unify the attention control mechanisms in a tuning-free framework for text-guided editing. Combining them, we present inversion-free editing (InfEdit), which allows for consistent and faithful editing for both rigid and non-rigid semantic changes, catering to intricate modifications without compromising on the image's integrity and explicit inversion. Through extensive experiments, InfEdit shows strong performance in various editing tasks and also maintains a seamless workflow (less than 3 seconds on one single A40), demonstrating the potential for real-time applications.

        "abstract": "We introduce an approach for augmenting text-to-video generation models with customized motions, extending their capabilities beyond the motions depicted in the original training data. By leveraging a few video samples demonstrating specific movements as input, our method learns and generalizes the input motion patterns for diverse, text-specified scenarios. Our contributions are threefold. First, to achieve our results, we finetune an existing text-to-video model to learn a novel mapping between the depicted motion in the input examples to a new unique token. To avoid overfitting to the new custom motion, we introduce an approach for regularization over videos. Second, by leveraging the motion priors in a pretrained model, our method can produce novel videos featuring multiple people doing the custom motion, and can invoke the motion in combination with other motions. Furthermore, our approach extends to the multimodal customization of motion and appearance of individualized subjects, enabling the generation of videos featuring unique characters and distinct motions. Third, to validate our method, we introduce an approach for quantitatively evaluating the learned custom motion and perform a systematic ablation study. We show that our method significantly outperforms prior appearance-based customization approaches when extended to the motion customization task. "

        "abstract": "Public discourse on critical issues such as climate change is progressively shifting to social media platforms that prioritize short-form video content. To improve our understanding of this transition, we studied the video content produced by 21 prominent YouTube creators who have expanded their influence to TikTok as information disseminators. Using dictionary-based tools and BERT-based embeddings, we analyzed the transcripts of nearly 7k climate-related videos across both platforms and the 574k comments they received. We found that, when using TikTok, creators use a more emotionally resonant, self-referential, and action-oriented language compared to YouTube. We also observed a strong semantic alignment between videos and comments, with creators who excel at diversifying their TikTok content from YouTube typically receiving responses that more closely align with their produced content. This suggests that tailored communication strategies hold greater promise in directing public discussion towards desired topics, which bears implications for the design of effective climate communication campaigns.

Some of the most useful applications require processing large numbers of samples at a time and using long contexts, both significantly increasing the memory communication load of the models. We introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by reducing the memory bandwidth requirements within the attention blocks through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show how SparQ Attention can decrease the attention memory bandwidth requirements up to eight times without any loss in accuracy by evaluating Llama 2 and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

One of the standing issues is the small input window of current models which often cannot fully fit the context code required for a bug fix (e.g., method or class declarations of a project). Instead, input is often restricted to the local context, that is, the lines below and above the bug location. In this work we study the importance of this local context on repair success: how much local context is needed?; is context before or after the bug location more important? how is local context tied to the bug type? To answer these questions we train and evaluate Transformer models in many different local context configurations on three datasets and two programming languages. Our results indicate that overall repair success increases with the size of the local context (albeit not for all bug types) and confirm the common practice that roughly 50-60% of the input window should be used for context leading the bug. Our results are not only relevant for researchers working on Transformer-based APR tools but also for benchmark and dataset creators who must decide what and how much context to include in their datasets.

We then categorize vision-based control methods into indirect, semi-direct, and end-to-end approaches from the perception-control perspective. We further explore various applications of vision-based drones with learning capabilities, ranging from single-agent systems to more complex multi-agent and heterogeneous system scenarios, and underscore the challenges and innovations characterizing each area. Finally, we explore open questions and potential solutions, paving the way for ongoing research and development in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field.

        "abstract": "The field of generative image inpainting and object insertion has made significant progress with the recent advent of latent diffusion models. Utilizing a precise object mask can greatly enhance these applications. However, due to the challenges users encounter in creating high-fidelity masks, there is a tendency for these methods to rely on more coarse masks (e.g., bounding box) for these applications. This results in limited control and compromised background content preservation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SmartMask, which allows any novice user to create detailed masks for precise object insertion. Combined with a ControlNet-Inpaint model, our experiments demonstrate that SmartMask achieves superior object insertion quality, preserving the background content more effectively than previous methods. Notably, unlike prior works the proposed approach can also be used even without user-mask guidance, which allows it to perform mask-free object insertion at diverse positions and scales. Furthermore, we find that when used iteratively with a novel instruction-tuning based planning model, SmartMask can be used to design detailed layouts from scratch. As compared with user-scribble based layout design, we observe that SmartMask allows for better quality outputs with layout-to-image generation methods.

Yet, we still know very little about what these pre-trained models learn about source code. In this article, we use probing--simple diagnostic tasks that do not further train the models--to discover to what extent pre-trained models learn about specific aspects of source code. We use an extensible framework to define 15 probing tasks that exercise surface, syntactic, structural and semantic characteristics of source code. We probe 8 pre-trained source code models, as well as a natural language model (BERT) as our baseline. We find that models that incorporate some structural information (such as GraphCodeBERT) have a better representation of source code characteristics. Surprisingly, we find that for some probing tasks, BERT is competitive with the source code models, indicating that there are ample opportunities to improve source-code specific pre-training on the respective code characteristics. We encourage other researchers to evaluate their models with our probing task suite, so that they may peer into the hidden layers of the models and identify what intrinsic code characteristics are encoded.

        "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have become popular tools for image synthesis because of their high-quality outputs. However, like other large-scale models, they may leak private information about their training data. Here, we demonstrate a privacy vulnerability of diffusion models through a \\emph{membership inference (MI) attack}, which aims to identify whether a target example belongs to the training set when given the trained diffusion model. Our proposed MI attack learns quantile regression models that predict (a quantile of) the distribution of reconstruction loss on examples not used in training. This allows us to define a granular hypothesis test for determining the membership of a point in the training set, based on thresholding the reconstruction loss of that point using a custom threshold tailored to the example. We also provide a simple bootstrap technique that takes a majority membership prediction over ``a bag of weak attackers'' which improves the accuracy over individual quantile regression models. We show that our attack outperforms the prior state-of-the-art attack while being substantially less computationally expensive -- prior attacks required training multiple ``shadow models'' with the same architecture as the model under attack, whereas our attack requires training only much smaller models.

        "abstract": "Accurate and reliable motion prediction is essential for safe urban autonomy. The most prominent motion prediction approaches are based on modeling the distribution of possible future trajectories of each actor in autonomous system's vicinity. These \"independent\" marginal predictions might be accurate enough to properly describe casual driving situations where the prediction target is not likely to interact with other actors. They are, however, inadequate for modeling interactive situations where the actors' future trajectories are likely to intersect. To mitigate this issue we propose Kraken -- a real-time trajectory prediction model capable of approximating pairwise interactions between the actors as well as producing accurate marginal predictions. Kraken relies on a simple Greedy Mode Processing technique allowing it to convert a factorized prediction for a pair of agents into a physically-plausible joint prediction. It also utilizes the Mode Transformer module to increase the diversity of predicted trajectories and make the joint prediction more informative. We evaluate Kraken on Waymo Motion Prediction challenge where it held the first place in the Interaction leaderboard and the second place in the Motion leaderboard in October 2021. "

        "abstract": "Creating controllable, photorealistic, and geometrically detailed digital doubles of real humans solely from video data is a key challenge in Computer Graphics and Vision, especially when real-time performance is required. Recent methods attach a neural radiance field (NeRF) to an articulated structure, e.g., a body model or a skeleton, to map points into a pose canonical space while conditioning the NeRF on the skeletal pose. These approaches typically parameterize the neural field with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) leading to a slow runtime. To address this drawback, we propose TriHuman a novel human-tailored, deformable, and efficient tri-plane representation, which achieves real-time performance, state-of-the-art pose-controllable geometry synthesis as well as photorealistic rendering quality. At the core, we non-rigidly warp global ray samples into our undeformed tri-plane texture space, which effectively addresses the problem of global points being mapped to the same tri-plane locations. We then show how such a tri-plane feature representation can be conditioned on the skeletal motion to account for dynamic appearance and geometry changes. Our results demonstrate a clear step towards higher quality in terms of geometry and appearance modeling of humans as well as runtime performance. "

        "abstract": "Hallucination is a well-known phenomenon in text generated by large language models (LLMs). The existence of hallucinatory responses is found in almost all application scenarios e.g., summarization, question-answering (QA) etc. For applications requiring high reliability (e.g., customer-facing assistants), the potential existence of hallucination in LLM-generated text is a critical problem. The amount of hallucination can be reduced by leveraging information retrieval to provide relevant background information to the LLM. However, LLMs can still generate hallucinatory content for various reasons (e.g., prioritizing its parametric knowledge over the context, failure to capture the relevant information from the context, etc.). Detecting hallucinations through automated methods is thus paramount. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce a sophisticated dataset, DelucionQA, that captures hallucinations made by retrieval-augmented LLMs for a domain-specific QA task. Furthermore, we propose a set of hallucination detection methods to serve as baselines for future works from the research community. Analysis and case study are also provided to share valuable insights on hallucination phenomena in the target scenario. "

Despite this body of work, a formal model for describing and representing these hallucinations (with relevant meta-data) at a fine-grained level, is still lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting the Hallucination Ontology or HALO, a formal, extensible ontology written in OWL that currently offers support for six different types of hallucinations known to arise in LLMs, along with support for provenance and experimental metadata. We also collect and publish a dataset containing hallucinations that we inductively gathered across multiple independent Web sources, and show that HALO can be successfully used to model this dataset and answer competency questions.

Our key insight is that fine-tuned models can be quickly swapped in and out of GPU memory by extracting and compressing the delta between each model and its pre-trained base model. We propose DeltaZip, an LLM serving system that efficiently serves multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models concurrently by aggressively compressing model deltas by a factor of $6\\times$ to $8\\times$ while maintaining high model quality. DeltaZip increases serving throughput by $1.5\\times$ to $3\\times$ and improves SLO attainment compared to a vanilla HuggingFace serving system. "

        "abstract": "Despite their ability to generate high-resolution and diverse images from text prompts, text-to-image diffusion models often suffer from slow iterative sampling processes. Model distillation is one of the most effective directions to accelerate these models. However, previous distillation methods fail to retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images for training, either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher model. In response to this limitation, we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named $\\textbf{SwiftBrush}$. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis, in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth, our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step. In spite of its simplicity, our model stands as one of the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image data. Remarkably, SwiftBrush achieves an FID score of $\\textbf{16.67}$ and a CLIP score of $\\textbf{0.29}$ on the COCO-30K benchmark, achieving competitive results or even substantially surpassing existing state-of-the-art distillation techniques.
