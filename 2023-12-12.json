        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05265",
        "abstract": "This paper explores privacy-compliant group-level emotion recognition ''in-the-wild'' within the EmotiW Challenge 2023. Group-level emotion recognition can be useful in many fields including social robotics, conversational agents, e-coaching and learning analytics. This research imposes itself using only global features avoiding individual ones, i.e. all features that can be used to identify or track people in videos (facial landmarks, body poses, audio diarization, etc.). The proposed multimodal model is composed of a video and an audio branches with a cross-attention between modalities. The video branch is based on a fine-tuned ViT architecture. The audio branch extracts Mel-spectrograms and feed them through CNN blocks into a transformer encoder. Our training paradigm includes a generated synthetic dataset to increase the sensitivity of our model on facial expression within the image in a data-driven way. The extensive experiments show the significance of our methodology. Our privacy-compliant proposal performs fairly on the EmotiW challenge, with 79.24% and 75.13% of accuracy respectively on validation and test set for the best models. Noticeably, our findings highlight that it is possible to reach this accuracy level with privacy-compliant features using only 5 frames uniformly distributed on the video. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05269",
        "abstract": "The egocentric video natural language query (NLQ) task involves localizing a temporal window in an egocentric video that provides an answer to a posed query, which has wide applications in building personalized AI assistants. Prior methods for this task have focused on improvements of network architecture and leveraging pre-training for enhanced image and video features, but have struggled with capturing long-range temporal dependencies in lengthy videos, and cumbersome end-to-end training. Motivated by recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision language models, we introduce LifelongMemory, a novel framework that utilizes multiple pre-trained models to answer queries from extensive egocentric video content. We address the unique challenge by employing a pre-trained captioning model to create detailed narratives of the videos. These narratives are then used to prompt a frozen LLM to generate coarse-grained temporal window predictions, which are subsequently refined using a pre-trained NLQ model. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against existing supervised end-to-end learning methods, underlining the potential of integrating multiple pre-trained multimodal large language models in complex vision-language tasks. We provide a comprehensive analysis of key design decisions and hyperparameters in our pipeline, offering insights and practical guidelines. "

        "abstract": "Though low-bit quantization enables efficient storage and inference of deep neural networks, it often requires the use of training data to maintain resilience against quantization errors. However, training data are frequently subject to privacy or copyright concerns. In this work, we address the challenge of Data-Scarce Quantization, where access to training data is severely limited or non-existent for quantization purposes. Conventional approaches typically rely on inverting dummy images or jointly training generative models to produce synthetic input samples. However, these methods struggle to accurately recreate complex objects in large-scale datasets like ImageNet. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StableQ, a novel method that utilizes an advanced text-to-image diffusion model to generate high-resolution, photo-realistic synthetic data. To verify the quality of the generated data, we implement two robust filtering mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to select images that closely resemble the intrinsic characteristics of the actual training data. Furthermore, in scenarios where limited training data are available, we use these data to guide the synthetic data generation process by inverting a learnable token embedding in the text encoder. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that StbaleQ sets a new benchmark in both zero-shot and few-shot quantization, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05274",
        "abstract": "Most recent works of test-time adaptation (TTA) aim to alleviate domain shift problems by re-training source classifiers in each domain. On the other hand, the emergence of the diffusion model provides another solution to TTA, which directly maps the test data from the target domain to the source domain based on a diffusion model pre-trained in the source domain. The source classifier does not need to be fine-tuned. However, 1) the semantic information loss from test data to the source domain and 2) the model shift between the source classifier and diffusion model would prevent the diffusion model from mapping the test data back to the source domain correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel guidance-based diffusion-driven adaptation (GDDA) to overcome the data shift and let the diffusion model find a better way to go back to the source. Concretely, we first propose detail and global guidance to better keep the common semantics of the test and source data. The two guidance include a contrastive loss and mean squared error to alleviate the information loss by fully exploring the diffusion model and the test data. Meanwhile, we propose a classifier-aware guidance to reduce the bias caused by the model shift, which can incorporate the source classifier's information into the generation process of the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on three image datasets with three classifier backbones demonstrate that GDDA significantly performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines. On CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNetC, GDDA achieves 11.54\\%, 19.05\\%, and 11.63\\% average accuracy improvements, respectively. GDDA even achieves equal performance compared with methods of re-training classifiers. The code is available in the supplementary material. "

However, the impacts and limits of such LLMs in system security domain are less explored. In this paper, we delve into the limits of LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in seven software security applications including vulnerability detection/repair, debugging, debloating, decompilation, patching, root cause analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. Our exploration reveals that ChatGPT not only excels at generating code, which is the conventional application of language models, but also demonstrates strong capability in understanding user-provided commands in natural languages, reasoning about control and data flows within programs, generating complex data structures, and even decompiling assembly code. Notably, GPT-4 showcases significant improvements over GPT-3.5 in most security tasks. Also, certain limitations of ChatGPT in security-related tasks are identified, such as its constrained ability to process long code contexts. "

In this paper, we seek to carefully prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with domain-level knowledge as a better marketing-oriented knowledge miner for marketing-oriented knowledge graph construction, which is however non-trivial, suffering from several inevitable issues in real-world marketing scenarios, i.e., uncontrollable relation generation of LLMs,insufficient prompting ability of a single prompt, the unaffordable deployment cost of LLMs. To this end, we propose PAIR, a novel Progressive prompting Augmented mIning fRamework for harvesting marketing-oriented knowledge graph with LLMs. In particular, we reduce the pure relation generation to an LLM based adaptive relation filtering process through the knowledge-empowered prompting technique. Next, we steer LLMs for entity expansion with progressive prompting augmentation,followed by a reliable aggregation with comprehensive consideration of both self-consistency and semantic relatedness. In terms of online serving, we specialize in a small and white-box PAIR (i.e.,LightPAIR),which is fine-tuned with a high-quality corpus provided by a strong teacher-LLM. Extensive experiments and practical applications in audience targeting verify the effectiveness of the proposed (Light)PAIR. "

However, the absence of fine-grained visual object detection hinders the model from understanding the details of images, leading to irreparable visual hallucinations and factual errors. In this paper, we propose Lyrics, a novel multi-modal pre-training and instruction fine-tuning paradigm that bootstraps vision-language alignment from fine-grained cross-modal collaboration. Building on the foundation of BLIP-2, Lyrics infuses local visual features extracted from a visual refiner that includes image tagging, object detection and semantic segmentation modules into the Querying Transformer, while on the text side, the language inputs equip the boundary boxes and tags derived from the visual refiner. We further introduce a two-stage training scheme, in which the pre-training stage bridges the modality gap through explicit and comprehensive vision-language alignment targets. During the instruction fine-tuning stage, we introduce semantic-aware visual feature extraction, a crucial method that enables the model to extract informative features from concrete visual objects. Our approach achieves strong performance on 13 held-out datasets across various vision-language tasks, and demonstrates promising multi-modal understanding and detailed depiction capabilities in real dialogue scenarios.

        "abstract": "The essence of a video lies in its dynamic motions, including character actions, object movements, and camera movements. While text-to-video generative diffusion models have recently advanced in creating diverse contents, controlling specific motions through text prompts remains a significant challenge. A primary issue is the coupling of appearance and motion, often leading to overfitting on appearance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MotionCrafter, a novel one-shot instance-guided motion customization method. MotionCrafter employs a parallel spatial-temporal architecture that injects the reference motion into the temporal component of the base model, while the spatial module is independently adjusted for character or style control. To enhance the disentanglement of motion and appearance, we propose an innovative dual-branch motion disentanglement approach, comprising a motion disentanglement loss and an appearance prior enhancement strategy. During training, a frozen base model provides appearance normalization, effectively separating appearance from motion and thereby preserving diversity. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, along with user preference tests, demonstrate that MotionCrafter can successfully integrate dynamic motions while preserving the coherence and quality of the base model with a wide range of appearance generation capabilities.

We employ a multi-latent extension to handle inconsistencies present in dynamic face videos to re-synthesize consistent 3D representations from the sequence.

It can correct a neural model by patching 1 or 2 neurons. As the pioneer work on neuron-level model editing of generative models, we formalize the editing process and introduce the involved concepts. Besides, we also introduce new measures to evaluate its generalization ability, and build a benchmark for further study. Our approach is evaluated on three coding tasks, including API-seq recommendation, line-level code generation, and pseudocode-to-code transaction. It outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin on both effectiveness and efficiency measures.

        "abstract": "Human intelligence relies in part on our brains' ability to create abstract mental models that succinctly capture the hidden blueprint of our reality. Such abstract world models notably allow us to rapidly navigate novel situations by generalizing prior knowledge, a trait deep learning systems have historically struggled to replicate. However, the recent shift from supervised to self-supervised objectives, combined with expressive transformer-based architectures, have yielded powerful foundation models that appear to learn versatile representations that can support a wide range of downstream tasks. This promising development raises the intriguing possibility of such models developing in silico abstract world models. We test this hypothesis by studying the inner workings of small-scale transformers trained to reconstruct partially masked visual scenes generated from a simple blueprint. We show that the network develops intermediate abstract representations, or abstractions, that encode all semantic features of the dataset. These abstractions manifest as low-dimensional manifolds where the embeddings of semantically related tokens transiently converge, thus allowing for the generalization of downstream computations. Using precise manipulation experiments, we demonstrate that abstractions are central to the network's decision-making process. Our research also suggests that these abstractions are compositionally structured, exhibiting features like contextual independence and part-whole relationships that mirror the compositional nature of the dataset. Finally, we introduce a Language-Enhanced Architecture (LEA) designed to encourage the network to articulate its computations. We find that LEA develops an abstraction-centric language that can be easily interpreted, allowing us to more readily access and steer the network's decision-making process. "

The VRM reduces the estimation error in ERM by replacing the point-wise kernel estimates with a more precise estimation of true data distribution that reduces the gap between data points \\textbf{within each domain}. However, in the DG setting, the estimation error of true data distribution by ERM is mainly caused by the distribution shift \\textbf{between domains} which cannot be fully addressed by simple data augmentation techniques within each domain. Inspired by this limitation of VRM, we propose a novel data augmentation named Cross Domain Generative Augmentation (CDGA) that replaces the pointwise kernel estimates in ERM with new density estimates in the \\textbf{vicinity of domain pairs} so that the gap between domains is further reduced. To this end, CDGA, which is built upon latent diffusion models (LDM), generates synthetic images to fill the gap between all domains and as a result, reduces the non-iidness. We show that CDGA outperforms SOTA DG methods under the Domainbed benchmark. To explain the effectiveness of CDGA, we generate more than 5 Million synthetic images and perform extensive ablation studies including data scaling laws, distribution visualization, domain shift quantification, adversarial robustness, and loss landscape analysis.

        "abstract": "Generative models have been very popular in the recent years for their image generation capabilities. GAN-based models are highly regarded for their disentangled latent space, which is a key feature contributing to their success in controlled image editing. On the other hand, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality images. However, the latent space of diffusion models is not as thoroughly explored or understood. Existing methods that aim to explore the latent space of diffusion models usually relies on text prompts to pinpoint specific semantics. However, this approach may be restrictive in areas such as art, fashion, or specialized fields like medicine, where suitable text prompts might not be available or easy to conceive thus limiting the scope of existing work. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to discover latent semantics in text-to-image diffusion models without relying on text prompts. Our method takes a small set of unlabeled images from specific domains, such as faces or cats, and a pre-trained diffusion model, and discovers diverse semantics in unsupervised fashion using a contrastive learning objective. Moreover, the learned directions can be applied simultaneously, either within the same domain (such as various types of facial edits) or across different domains (such as applying cat and face edits within the same image) without interfering with each other. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves highly disentangled edits, outperforming existing approaches in both diffusion-based and GAN-based latent space editing methods. "

Despite the proficiency of LDM in various applications, such as text-to-image generation, facilitated by robust text encoders and a variational autoencoder, the critical need to deploy large generative models on edge devices compels a search for more compact yet effective alternatives. Post Training Quantization (PTQ), a method to compress the operational size of deep learning models, encounters challenges when applied to LDM due to temporal and structural complexities. This study proposes a quantization strategy that efficiently quantize LDMs, leveraging Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR) as a pivotal metric for evaluation. By treating the quantization discrepancy as relative noise and identifying sensitive part(s) of a model, we propose an efficient quantization approach encompassing both global and local strategies. The global quantization process mitigates relative quantization noise by initiating higher-precision quantization on sensitive blocks, while local treatments address specific challenges in quantization-sensitive and time-sensitive modules. The outcomes of our experiments reveal that the implementation of both global and local treatments yields a highly efficient and effective Post Training Quantization (PTQ) of LDMs. "

In this paper, we attempt to detect harmful memes based on advanced reasoning over the interplay of multimodal information in memes. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning, we first conduct abductive reasoning with LLMs. Then we propose a novel generative framework to learn reasonable thoughts from LLMs for better multimodal fusion and lightweight fine-tuning, which consists of two training stages: 1) Distill multimodal reasoning knowledge from LLMs; and 2) Fine-tune the generative framework to infer harmfulness.

        "abstract": "Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) in the wild is still hindered by data limitations, e.g., insufficient quantity and diversity of pose, occlusion and illumination, as well as the inherent ambiguity of facial expressions. In contrast, static facial expression recognition (SFER) currently shows much higher performance and can benefit from more abundant high-quality training data. Moreover, the appearance features and dynamic dependencies of DFER remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel Static-to-Dynamic model (S2D) that leverages existing SFER knowledge and dynamic information implicitly encoded in extracted facial landmark-aware features, thereby significantly improving DFER performance. Firstly, we build and train an image model for SFER, which incorporates a standard Vision Transformer (ViT) and Multi-View Complementary Prompters (MCPs) only. Then, we obtain our video model (i.e., S2D), for DFER, by inserting Temporal-Modeling Adapters (TMAs) into the image model. MCPs enhance facial expression features with landmark-aware features inferred by an off-the-shelf facial landmark detector. And the TMAs capture and model the relationships of dynamic changes in facial expressions, effectively extending the pre-trained image model for videos. Notably, MCPs and TMAs only increase a fraction of trainable parameters (less than +10\\%) to the original image model. Moreover, we present a novel Emotion-Anchors (i.e., reference samples for each emotion category) based Self-Distillation Loss to reduce the detrimental influence of ambiguous emotion labels, further enhancing our S2D. Experiments conducted on popular SFER and DFER datasets show that we achieve the state of the art. "

        "abstract": "Open-World Recognition (OWR) is an emerging field that makes a machine learning model competent in rejecting the unknowns, managing them, and incrementally adding novel samples to the base knowledge. However, this broad objective is not practical for an agent that works on a specific task. Not all rejected samples will be used for learning continually in the future. Some novel images in the open environment may not belong to the domain of interest. Hence, identifying the unknown in the domain of interest is essential for a machine learning model to learn merely the important samples. In this study, we propose an evaluation protocol for estimating a model's capability in separating unknown in-domain (ID) and unknown out-of-domain (OOD). We evaluated using three approaches with an unknown domain and demonstrated the possibility of identifying the domain of interest using the pre-trained parameters through traditional transfer learning, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), and Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier with First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH). We experimented with five different domains: garbage, food, dogs, plants, and birds. The results show that all approaches can be used as an initial baseline yielding a good accuracy. In addition, a Balanced Accuracy (BACCU) score from a pre-trained model indicates a tendency to excel in one or more domains of interest. We observed that MobileNetV3 yielded the highest BACCU score for the garbage domain and surpassed complex models such as the transformer network. Meanwhile, our results also suggest that a strong representation in the pre-trained model is important for identifying unknown classes in the same domain. This study could open the bridge toward open-world recognition in domain-specific tasks where the relevancy of the unknown classes is vital. "

Our approach involved an automated process of converting 346 scholarly articles into 6240 images, which represents a benchmark dataset in this task, followed by deploying GPT-4V to categorize and analyze these images using natural language prompts. This methodology enabled GPT-4V to accurately identify and interpret key plots integral to MOF characterization, such as nitrogen isotherms, PXRD patterns, and TGA curves, among others, with accuracy and recall above 93%. The model's proficiency in extracting critical information from these plots not only underscores its capability in data mining but also highlights its potential in aiding the creation of comprehensive digital databases for reticular chemistry. In addition, the extracted nitrogen isotherm data from the selected literature allowed for a comparison between theoretical and experimental porosity values for over 200 compounds, highlighting certain discrepancies and underscoring the importance of integrating computational and experimental data.

For alleviating these limitations and realizing efficient real image editing, we propose a novel editing technique that only requires an input image and target text for various editing types including non-rigid edits without fine-tuning diffusion model. Our method contains three novelties:(I) Target-text Inversion Schedule (TTIS) is designed to fine-tune the input target text embedding to achieve fast image reconstruction without image caption and acceleration of convergence.(II) Progressive Transition Scheme applies progressive linear interpolation between target text embedding and its fine-tuned version to generate transition embedding for maintaining non-rigid editing capability.(III) Balanced Attention Module (BAM) balances the tradeoff between textual description and image semantics.By the means of combining self-attention map from reconstruction process and cross-attention map from transition process, the guidance of target text embeddings in diffusion process is optimized.In order to demonstrate editing capability, effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BARET, we have conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. Moreover, results derived from user study and ablation study further prove the superiority over other methods. "

        "abstract": "The blooming diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have garnered significant interest due to their impressive performance and the elegant inspiration they draw from physics. While earlier DPMs relied upon the Markovian assumption, recent methods based on differential equations have been rapidly applied to enhance the efficiency and capabilities of these models. However, a theoretical interpretation encapsulating these diverse algorithms is insufficient yet pressingly required to guide further development of DPMs. In response to this need, we present FreeFlow, a framework that provides a thorough explanation of the diffusion formula as time-dependent optimal transport, where the evolutionary pattern of probability density is given by the gradient flows of a functional defined in Wasserstein space. Crucially, our framework necessitates a unified description that not only clarifies the subtle mechanism of DPMs but also indicates the roots of some defects through creative involvement of Lagrangian and Eulerian views to understand the evolution of probability flow. We particularly demonstrate that the core equation of FreeFlow condenses all stochastic and deterministic DPMs into a single case, showcasing the expansibility of our method. Furthermore, the Riemannian geometry employed in our work has the potential to bridge broader subjects in mathematics, which enable the involvement of more profound tools for the establishment of more outstanding and generalized models in the future.

        "abstract": "Game theory, as an analytical tool, is frequently utilized to analyze human behavior in social science research. With the high alignment between the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, a promising research direction is to employ LLMs as substitutes for humans in game experiments, enabling social science research. However, despite numerous empirical researches on the combination of LLMs and game theory, the capability boundaries of LLMs in game theory remain unclear. In this research, we endeavor to systematically analyze LLMs in the context of game theory. Specifically, rationality, as the fundamental principle of game theory, serves as the metric for evaluating players' behavior -- building a clear desire, refining belief about uncertainty, and taking optimal actions. Accordingly, we select three classical games (dictator game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and ring-network game) to analyze to what extent LLMs can achieve rationality in these three aspects. The experimental results indicate that even the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) exhibits substantial disparities compared to humans in game theory. For instance, LLMs struggle to build desires based on uncommon preferences, fail to refine belief from many simple patterns, and may overlook or modify refined belief when taking actions. Therefore, we consider that introducing LLMs into game experiments in the field of social science should be approached with greater caution. "

Remarkably with this method, even when using one token accounting for a mere 5,000 parameters, Aligner can still perform comparably well to state-of-the-art LLM adaptation methods like LoRA that require millions of parameters. This capacity is substantiated in both instruction following and value alignment tasks. Besides the multiple order-of-magnitude improvement in parameter efficiency, the insight Aligner provides into the internal mechanisms of LLMs is also valuable. The architectural features and efficacy of our method, in addition to our experiments demonstrate that an LLM separates its internal handling of \"form\" and \"knowledge\" in a somewhat orthogonal manner. This finding promises to motivate new research into LLM mechanism understanding and value alignment. "

In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory.

        "abstract": "The ability to modify and extend an operating system is an important feature for improving a system's security, reliability, and performance. The extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF) ecosystem has emerged as the standard mechanism for extending the Linux kernel and has recently been ported to Windows. eBPF programs inject new logic into the kernel that the system will execute before or after existing logic. While the eBPF ecosystem provides a flexible mechanism for kernel extension, it is difficult for developers to write eBPF programs today. An eBPF developer must have deep knowledge of the internals of the operating system to determine where to place logic and cope with programming limitations on the control flow and data accesses of their eBPF program enforced by the eBPF verifier. This paper presents KEN, an alternative framework that alleviates the difficulty of writing an eBPF program by allowing Kernel Extensions to be written in Natural language. KEN uses recent advances in large language models (LLMs) to synthesize an eBPF program given a user's English language prompt. To ensure that LLM's output is semantically equivalent to the user's prompt, KEN employs a combination of LLM-empowered program comprehension, symbolic execution, and a series of feedback loops. KEN's key novelty is the combination of these techniques. In particular, the system uses symbolic execution in a novel structure that allows it to combine the results of program synthesis and program comprehension and build on the recent success that LLMs have shown for each of these tasks individually. To evaluate KEN, we developed a new corpus of natural language prompts for eBPF programs. We show that KEN produces correct eBPF programs on 80% which is an improvement of a factor of 2.67 compared to an LLM-empowered program synthesis baseline. "

To address these issues, we introduce DPoser, a robust and versatile human pose prior built upon diffusion models. Designed with optimization frameworks, DPoser seamlessly integrates into various pose-centric applications, including human mesh recovery, pose completion, and motion denoising. Specifically, by formulating these tasks as inverse problems, we employ variational diffusion sampling for efficient solving. Furthermore, acknowledging the disparity between the articulated poses we focus on and structured images in previous research, we propose a truncated timestep scheduling to boost performance on downstream tasks. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate DPoser's superiority over existing state-of-the-art pose priors across multiple tasks. "

However, current CoT methods often require manual writing or LLMs with over 100 billion parameters to generate, impeding their applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. In this study, we investigate lightweight Language Models (lLMs), which are defined to have fewer than 10 billion parameters. Empirically, we find that most lLMs cannot generate high-quality CoTs when prompted by the few-shot method, but can take advantage of high-quality CoTs generated elsewhere to improve their performance in code generation. Based on these findings, we design a novel approach COTTON which can leverage lLMs to automatically generate CoTs for code generation. We synthesize new datasets and conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks. The results show that the CoTs generated by COTTON outperform the baselines in terms of automated and human evaluation metrics. In particular, the CoTs generated by COTTON boost various lLMs to achieve higher performance gains than those generated by LLMs such as ChatGLM (130B), and are competitive with those generated by gpt-3.5-turbo (175B).

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) exhibit zero-shot mathematical reasoning capacity as a behavior emergent with scale, commonly manifesting as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning. However, multiple empirical findings suggest that this prowess is exclusive to LLMs with exorbitant sizes (beyond 50 billion parameters). Meanwhile, educational neuroscientists suggest that symbolic algebraic manipulation be introduced around the same time as arithmetic word problems to modularize language-to-formulation, symbolic manipulation of the formulation, and endgame arithmetic. In this paper, we start with the hypothesis that much smaller LMs, which are weak at multi-step reasoning, can achieve reasonable arithmetic reasoning if arithmetic word problems are posed as a formalize-then-solve task. In our architecture, which we call SYRELM, the LM serves the role of a translator to map natural language arithmetic questions into a formal language (FL) description. A symbolic solver then evaluates the FL expression to obtain the answer. A small frozen LM, equipped with an efficient low-rank adapter, is capable of generating FL expressions that incorporate natural language descriptions of the arithmetic problem (e.g., variable names and their purposes, formal expressions combining variables, etc.). We adopt policy-gradient reinforcement learning to train the adapted LM, informed by the non-differentiable symbolic solver. This marks a sharp departure from the recent development in tool-augmented LLMs, in which the external tools (e.g., calculator, Web search, etc.) are essentially detached from the learning phase of the LM. SYRELM shows massive improvements (e.g., +30.65 absolute point improvement in accuracy on the SVAMP dataset using GPT-J 6B model) over base LMs, while keeping our testbed easy to diagnose, interpret and within reach of most researchers.

However, the broadcasting mode, in which drivers can freely choose their preferred orders from those broadcast by the platform, has received less attention. One important but challenging task in such a system is the determination of the optimal matching radius, which usually varies across space, time, and real-time supply/demand characteristics. This study develops a Transformer-Encoder-Based (TEB) model that predicts key system performance metrics for a range of matching radii, which enables the ride-hailing platform to select an optimal matching radius that maximizes overall system performance according to real-time supply and demand information. To simultaneously maximize multiple system performance metrics for matching radius determination, we devise a novel multi-task learning algorithm that enhances convergence speed of each task (corresponding to the optimization of one metric) and delivers more accurate overall predictions. We evaluate our methods in a simulation environment specifically designed for broadcasting-mode-based ride-hailing service. Our findings reveal that dynamically adjusting matching radii based on our proposed predict-then-optimize approach significantly improves system performance, e.g., increasing platform revenue by 7.55% and enhancing order fulfillment rate by 13% compared to benchmark algorithms.

It enhances the initial instance positions through weighted farthest point sampling and further refines the instance positions and proposals using aggregation averaging and center matching. Additionally, dual position embedding superposes the original and centralized position embeddings, thereby enhancing the model performance in distinguishing adjacent instances.

The resulting model is called TCNCA, a Temporal Convolutional Network with Chunked Attention. We evaluate TCNCA on EnWik8 language modeling, long-range-arena (LRA) sequence classification, as well as a synthetic reasoning benchmark associative recall. On EnWik8, TCNCA outperforms MEGA, reaching a lower loss with $1.37\\times$/$1.24\\times$ faster forward/backward pass during training. The dilated convolutions used in TCNCA are consistently and significantly faster operations than the FFT-based parallelized recurrence in GPUs, making them a scalable candidate for handling very large sequence lengths: they are up to $7.07\\times$/$2.86\\times$ faster in the forward/backward pass for sequences up to 131k. Further on LRA, TCNCA achieves, on average, $1.28\\times$ speed-up during inference with similar accuracy to what MEGA achieves.

Drawing an analogy to genetic expansibility, we term such module as learngene. To identify the expansion mechanism, we delve into the relationship between the layer position and its corresponding weight value, and find that linear function appropriately approximates this relationship. Building on this insight, we present Transformer as Linear Expansion of learnGene (TLEG), a novel approach for flexibly producing and initializing Transformers of diverse depths. Specifically, to learn learngene, we firstly construct an auxiliary Transformer linearly expanded from learngene, after which we train it through employing soft distillation. Subsequently, we can produce and initialize Transformers of varying depths via linearly expanding the well-trained learngene, thereby supporting diverse downstream scenarios. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification demonstrate that TLEG achieves comparable or better performance compared to many individual models trained from scratch, while reducing around 2$\\times$ training cost. When transferring one model to several downstream classification datasets, TLEG surpasses existing initialization methods by a large margin (e.g., +6.87% on iNat 2019 and +7.66% on CIFAR-100). Under the situation where we need to produce models of different scales adapting for different resource constraints, TLEG achieves comparable results while reducing around 19$\\times$ parameters stored to initialize these models and around 5$\\times$ training costs, in contrast to the pre-training and fine-tuning approach.

        "abstract": "Real-world image super-resolution (RWSR) is a long-standing problem as low-quality (LQ) images often have complex and unidentified degradations. Existing methods such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or continuous diffusion models present their own issues including GANs being difficult to train while continuous diffusion models requiring numerous inference steps. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Token Evaluation and Refinement (ITER) framework for RWSR, which utilizes a discrete diffusion model operating in the discrete token representation space, i.e., indexes of features extracted from a VQGAN codebook pre-trained with high-quality (HQ) images. We show that ITER is easier to train than GANs and more efficient than continuous diffusion models. Specifically, we divide RWSR into two sub-tasks, i.e., distortion removal and texture generation. Distortion removal involves simple HQ token prediction with LQ images, while texture generation uses a discrete diffusion model to iteratively refine the distortion removal output with a token refinement network. In particular, we propose to include a token evaluation network in the discrete diffusion process. It learns to evaluate which tokens are good restorations and helps to improve the iterative refinement results. Moreover, the evaluation network can first check status of the distortion removal output and then adaptively select total refinement steps needed, thereby maintaining a good balance between distortion removal and texture generation. Extensive experimental results show that ITER is easy to train and performs well within just 8 iterative steps. Our codes will be available publicly. "

Nonetheless, this technique often necessitates substantial computational resources, making it impractical for deployment by individuals or small-scale entities. Recently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a promising alternative, offering high capabilities on par with full tuning with reduced resource overhead. However, attaining satisfactory performance through the fine-tuning of LoRA is a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose PILLOW, which aims to improve LoRA's performance by a discrimination-based prompting method, leveraging LLMs' In-Context Learning ability. PILLOW incorporates a matching network that selects prompts from a user-defined prompt pool, concatenates the selected prompts with the user instruction as input, and performs inference using the LoRA-fine-tuned LLMs. Trained with Reinforcement Learning, PILLOW exhibits commensurate performance on various evaluation metrics compared with typical instruction fine-tuning methods, utilizing only consumer-grade GPU resources and exhibiting a large reduction in computational costs.

        "abstract": "Code optimization is a daunting task that requires a significant level of expertise from experienced programmers. This level of expertise is not sufficient when compared to the rapid development of new hardware architectures. Towards advancing the whole code optimization process, recent approaches rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a new framework to decrease the complexity of code optimization. The proposed framework builds on large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) and enables LLMs to receive feedback from their environment (i.e., unit tests) during the fine-tuning process. We compare our framework with existing state-of-the-art models and show that it is more efficient with respect to speed and computational usage, as a result of the decrement in training steps and its applicability to models with fewer parameters. Additionally, our framework reduces the possibility of logical and syntactical errors. Toward evaluating our approach, we run several experiments on the PIE dataset using a CodeT5 language model and RRHF, a new reinforcement learning algorithm. We adopt a variety of evaluation metrics with regards to optimization quality, and speedup. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework has similar results in comparison with existing models using shorter training times and smaller pre-trained models. In particular, we accomplish an increase of 5.6% and 2.2 over the baseline models concerning the %OP T and SP metrics. "

Many strategies have been proposed to mitigate the effects of inappropriate social biases learned during pretraining. Simultaneously, methods for model compression have become increasingly popular to reduce the computational burden of LLMs. Despite the popularity and need for both approaches, little work has been done to explore the interplay between these two. We perform a carefully controlled study of the impact of model compression via quantization and knowledge distillation on measures of social bias in LLMs. Longer pretraining and larger models led to higher social bias, and quantization showed a regularizer effect with its best trade-off around 20% of the original pretraining time.

The specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called {\\em Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem} has been at the center of the development of uncertainty control. However, an unstudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed, instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a first study to extend Schr\\\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue. It is developed in the context of Markov chains and random walks on graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal distribution represents the initial state occupation of a Markov chain, while others represent first-arrival time distributions at absorbing states signifying completion of tasks. We establish that when the prior is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal with respect to a likelihood cost that follows Schr\\\"odinger's dictum. "

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out for their impressive performance in intricate language modeling tasks. However, their demanding computational and memory needs pose obstacles for broad use on edge devices. Quantization is then introduced to boost LLMs' on-device efficiency. Recent works show that 8-bit or lower weight quantization is feasible with minimal impact on end-to-end task performance, while the activation is still not quantized. On the other hand, mainstream commodity edge devices still struggle to execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks effectively. In this paper, we propose Agile-Quant, an activation-guided quantization framework for popular Large Language Models (LLMs), and implement an end-to-end accelerator on multiple edge devices for faster inference. Considering the hardware profiling and activation analysis, we first introduce a basic activation quantization strategy to balance the trade-off of task performance and real inference speed. Then we leverage the activation-aware token pruning technique to reduce the outliers and the adverse impact on attentivity. Ultimately, we utilize the SIMD-based 4-bit multiplier and our efficient TRIP matrix multiplication to implement the accelerator for LLMs on the edge. We apply our framework on different scales of LLMs including LLaMA, OPT, and BLOOM with 4-bit or 8-bit for the activation and 4-bit for the weight quantization. Experiments show that Agile-Quant achieves simultaneous quantization of model weights and activations while maintaining task performance comparable to existing weight-only quantization methods. Moreover, in the 8- and 4-bit scenario, Agile-Quant achieves an on-device speedup of up to 2.55x compared to its FP16 counterparts across multiple edge devices, marking a pioneering advancement in this domain.

        "abstract": "Vision Transformers have been rapidly uprising in computer vision thanks to their outstanding scaling trends, and gradually replacing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recent works on self-supervised learning (SSL) introduce siamese pre-training tasks, on which Transformer backbones continue to demonstrate ever stronger results than CNNs. People come to believe that Transformers or self-attention modules are inherently more suitable than CNNs in the context of SSL. However, it is noteworthy that most if not all prior arts of SSL with CNNs chose the standard ResNets as their backbones, whose architecture effectiveness is known to already lag behind advanced Vision Transformers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the self-attention operation is crucial for the recent advances in SSL - or CNNs can deliver the same excellence with more advanced designs, too? Can we close the SSL performance gap between Transformers and CNNs? To answer these intriguing questions, we apply self-supervised pre-training to the recently proposed, stronger lager-kernel CNN architecture and conduct an apple-to-apple comparison with Transformers, in their SSL performance. Our results show that we are able to build pure CNN SSL architectures that perform on par with or better than the best SSL-trained Transformers, by just scaling up convolutional kernel sizes besides other small tweaks. Impressively, when transferring to the downstream tasks \\texttt{MS COCO} detection and segmentation, our SSL pre-trained CNN model (trained in 100 epochs) achieves the same good performance as the 300-epoch pre-trained Transformer counterpart. We hope this work can help to better understand what is essential (or not) for self-supervised learning backbones. "

While their potential is undeniable across various domains, this paper sets out on a captivating expedition to investigate their uncharted territory, the exploration of generating safety cases. In this paper, our primary objective is to delve into the existing knowledge base of GPT-4, focusing specifically on its understanding of the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN), a well-established notation allowing to visually represent safety cases. Subsequently, we perform four distinct experiments with GPT-4. These experiments are designed to assess its capacity for generating safety cases within a defined system and application domain. To measure the performance of GPT-4 in this context, we compare the results it generates with ground-truth safety cases created for an X-ray system system and a Machine-Learning (ML)-enabled component for tire noise recognition (TNR) in a vehicle. This allowed us to gain valuable insights into the model's generative capabilities. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates the capacity to produce safety arguments that are moderately accurate and reasonable. Furthermore, it exhibits the capability to generate safety cases that closely align with the semantic content of the reference safety cases used as ground-truths in our experiments. "

Consequently, such methods are not widely used for training large neural networks such as transformer-based models. We address these two issues by (i) formulating an inverse-free update of KFAC and (ii) imposing structures in each of the Kronecker factors, resulting in a method we term structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). On large modern neural networks, we show that, in contrast to KFAC, SINGD is memory efficient and numerically robust, and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision. Hence, our work closes a gap between first-order and second-order methods in modern low precision training for large neural nets. "

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this problem by retrieving a list of relevant tools for a given task. However, RAG's tool retrieval step requires all the required information to be explicitly present in the query. This is a limitation, as semantic search, the widely adopted tool retrieval method, can fail when the query is incomplete or lacks context. To address this limitation, we propose Context Tuning for RAG, which employs a smart context retrieval system to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan generation. Our lightweight context retrieval model uses numerical, categorical, and habitual usage signals to retrieve and rank context items. Our empirical results demonstrate that context tuning significantly enhances semantic search, achieving a 3.5-fold and 1.5-fold improvement in Recall@K for context retrieval and tool retrieval tasks respectively, and resulting in an 11.6% increase in LLM-based planner accuracy. Additionally, we show that our proposed lightweight model using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with LambdaMART outperforms GPT-4 based retrieval. Moreover, we observe context augmentation at plan generation, even after tool retrieval, reduces hallucination. "

When trying to classify action instances captured from multiple viewpoints, there is a higher degree of difficulty due to the difference in background, occlusion, and visibility of the captured action from different camera angles. To tackle the various problems introduced in multi-view action recognition, we propose a novel configuration of learnable transformer decoder queries, in conjunction with two supervised contrastive losses, to enforce the learning of action features that are robust to shifts in viewpoints. Our disentangled feature learning occurs in two stages: the transformer decoder uses separate queries to separately learn action and view information, which are then further disentangled using our two contrastive losses. We show that our model and method of training significantly outperforms all other uni-modal models on four multi-view action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and N-UCLA. Compared to previous RGB works, we see maximal improvements of 1.5\\%, 4.8\\%, 2.2\\%, and 4.8\\% on each dataset, respectively. "

However, trilinear interpolation struggles following fine-scale changes in low-quality data. Recent deep learning methods in super-resolving diffusion MRIs have focused on upsampling to a fixed spatial grid, but this does not satisfy tractography's need for a continuous field. In this work, we propose FENRI, a novel method that learns spatially-continuous fiber orientation density functions from low-resolution diffusion-weighted images. To quantify FENRI's capabilities in tractography, we also introduce an expanded simulated dataset built for evaluating deep-learning tractography models. We demonstrate that FENRI accurately predicts high-resolution fiber orientations from realistic low-quality data, and that FENRI-based tractography offers improved streamline reconstruction over the current use of trilinear interpolation.

However, one inevitable side effect is that they require massive memory storage and inference cost when deployed in production. Quantization is one of the popularized ways to alleviate the cost.

However, when processing data sequentially, it can suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where previous data is easily forgotten after training with new data. Existing incremental learning methods using knowledge distillation assume that continuous data chunks contain both 2D images and corresponding camera pose parameters, pre-estimated from the complete dataset. This poses a paradox as the necessary camera pose must be estimated from the entire dataset, even though the data arrives sequentially and future chunks are inaccessible. In contrast, we focus on a practical scenario where camera poses are unknown. We propose IL-NeRF, a novel framework for incremental NeRF training, to address this challenge. IL-NeRF's key idea lies in selecting a set of past camera poses as references to initialize and align the camera poses of incoming image data. This is followed by a joint optimization of camera poses and replay-based NeRF distillation. Our experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor scenes show that IL-NeRF handles incremental NeRF training and outperforms the baselines by up to $54.04\\%$ in rendering quality. "

However, existing methods usually rely on sophisticated and heavy 3D models to directly process the lifted 3D features that are not discriminative enough for clear segmentation boundaries. In this paper, we adopt the dense-sparse-dense design and propose an end-to-end camera-based SSC framework, termed SGN, to diffuse semantics from the semantic- and occupancy-aware seed voxels to the whole scene based on geometry prior and occupancy information. By designing hybrid guidance (sparse semantic and geometry guidance) and effective voxel aggregation for spatial occupancy and geometry priors, we enhance the feature separation between different categories and expedite the convergence of semantic diffusion.

Currently, Transformer and MLP are two paradigms for deep time-series forecasting and the former one is more prevailing in virtue of its exquisite attention mechanism and encoder-decoder architecture. However, data scientists seem to be more willing to dive into the research of encoder, leaving decoder unconcerned. Some researchers even adopt linear projections in lieu of the decoder to reduce the complexity. We argue that both extracting the features of input sequence and seeking the relations of input and prediction sequence, which are respective functions of encoder and decoder, are of paramount significance.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework named DRL-CPG to learn disentangled latent representation for controllable person image generation, which can produce realistic person images with desired poses and human attributes (e.g., pose, head, upper clothes, and pants) provided by various source persons. Unlike the existing works leveraging the semantic masks to obtain the representation of each component, we propose to generate disentangled latent code via a novel attribute encoder with transformers trained in a manner of curriculum learning from a relatively easy step to a gradually hard one. A random component mask-agnostic strategy is introduced to randomly remove component masks from the person segmentation masks, which aims at increasing the difficulty of training and promoting the transformer encoder to recognize the underlying boundaries between each component. This enables the model to transfer both the shape and texture of the components. Furthermore, we propose a novel attribute decoder network to integrate multi-level attributes (e.g., the structure feature and the attribute representation) with well-designed Dual Adaptive Denormalization (DAD) residual blocks. Extensive experiments strongly demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to transfer both the texture and shape of different human parts and yield realistic results. To our knowledge, we are the first to learn disentangled latent representations with transformers for person image generation. "

Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency and robust performance of our approach for super-resolution.

However, existing work cannot generate layered high-quality 3D humans with consistent body structures. As a result, these methods are unable to arbitrarily and separately change and edit the body and clothing of the human. In this paper, we propose a text-driven layered 3D human generation framework based on a novel physically-decoupled semantic-aware diffusion model. To keep the generated clothing consistent with the target text, we propose a semantic-confidence strategy for clothing that can eliminate the non-clothing content generated by the model. To match the clothing with different body shapes, we propose a SMPL-driven implicit field deformation network that enables the free transfer and reuse of clothing. Besides, we introduce uniform shape priors based on the SMPL model for body and clothing, respectively, which generates more diverse 3D content without being constrained by specific templates. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates 3D humans with consistent body structures but also allows free editing in a layered manner.

To adapt the traditional three-module fact-checking framework to the open domain setting, we first retrieve claim-related information as relevant evidence from open websites.

We evaluate the performance of our adapted three-module OE-Fact system on the Fact Extraction and Verification (FEVER) dataset.

To enable mutual enhancement between LLMs and SLMs, we propose CrossLM, where the SLMs promote the LLM to generate task-specific high-quality data, and both the LLM and SLMs are enhanced with the generated data. We evaluate CrossLM using publicly accessible language models across a range of benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that CrossLM significantly enhances the task-specific performance of SLMs on clients and the LLM on the cloud server simultaneously while preserving the LLM's generalization capability.

While recent advancements have introduced control over factors such as object localization, posture, and image contours, a crucial gap remains in our ability to control the interactions between objects in the generated content. Well-controlling interactions in generated images could yield meaningful applications, such as creating realistic scenes with interacting characters. In this work, we study the problems of conditioning T2I diffusion models with Human-Object Interaction (HOI) information, consisting of a triplet label (person, action, object) and corresponding bounding boxes. We propose a pluggable interaction control model, called InteractDiffusion that extends existing pre-trained T2I diffusion models to enable them being better conditioned on interactions. Specifically, we tokenize the HOI information and learn their relationships via interaction embeddings. A conditioning self-attention layer is trained to map HOI tokens to visual tokens, thereby conditioning the visual tokens better in existing T2I diffusion models. Our model attains the ability to control the interaction and location on existing T2I diffusion models, which outperforms existing baselines by a large margin in HOI detection score, as well as fidelity in FID and KID.

We introduce a novel multi-view radiance blending approach to predict radiance directly from multi-view videos. By incorporating continual learning techniques, NeVRF can efficiently reconstruct frames from sequential data without revisiting previous frames, enabling long-duration free-viewpoint video. Furthermore, with a tailored compression approach, NeVRF can compactly represent dynamic scenes, making dynamic radiance fields more practical in real-world scenarios.

        "abstract": "With the strong robusticity on illumination variations, near-infrared (NIR) can be an effective and essential complement to visible (VIS) facial expression recognition in low lighting or complete darkness conditions. However, facial expression recognition (FER) from NIR images presents more challenging problem than traditional FER due to the limitations imposed by the data scale and the difficulty of extracting discriminative features from incomplete visible lighting contents. In this paper, we give the first attempt to deep NIR facial expression recognition and proposed a novel method called near-infrared facial expression transformer (NFER-Former). Specifically, to make full use of the abundant label information in the field of VIS, we introduce a Self-Attention Orthogonal Decomposition mechanism that disentangles the expression information and spectrum information from the input image, so that the expression features can be extracted without the interference of spectrum variation. We also propose a Hypergraph-Guided Feature Embedding method that models some key facial behaviors and learns the structure of the complex correlations between them, thereby alleviating the interference of inter-class similarity. Additionally, we have constructed a large NIR-VIS Facial Expression dataset that includes 360 subjects to better validate the efficiency of NFER-Former. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that NFER-Former significantly improves the performance of NIR FER and achieves state-of-the-art results on the only two available NIR FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and Large-HFE.

Our findings reveal that while fine-tuning offers some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through fine-tuning, and that exposing them to numerous variations of the same fact during training could alleviate this problem.

We evaluate our approach on a real-world ICU dataset and compare it with supervised models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and XGBoost. We show that our approach achieves comparable sensitivity and generalizes well to an external dataset. We also visualize the latent space learned by the VAE and demonstrate its ability to disentangle clean and noisy samples. Our approach offers a promising solution for cleaning ICU data in clinical research and practice without the need for any labels whatsoever. "

Existing methods that attempt to address these problems mostly do not tend to address the fundamental cause behind these problems, which is the distributional discrepancies, and hence achieve sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose a particle filtering framework that can effectively address both problems by explicitly reducing the distributional discrepancies. Specifically, our method relies on a set of external guidance, including a small set of real images and a pre-trained object detector, to gauge the distribution gap, and then design the resampling weight accordingly to correct the gap. Experiments show that our methods can effectively correct missing object errors and improve image quality in various image generation tasks.

However, their black-boxed and probabilistic characteristics can lead to potential risks in the quality of outputs in diverse LLM applications. Recent studies have tested Quality Attributes (QAs), such as robustness or fairness, of LLMs by generating adversarial input texts. However, existing studies have limited their coverage of QAs and tasks in LLMs and are difficult to extend. Additionally, these studies have only used one evaluation metric, Attack Success Rate (ASR), to assess the effectiveness of their approaches. We propose a MEtamorphic Testing for Analyzing LLMs (METAL) framework to address these issues by applying Metamorphic Testing (MT) techniques. This approach facilitates the systematic testing of LLM qualities by defining Metamorphic Relations (MRs), which serve as modularized evaluation metrics. The METAL framework can automatically generate hundreds of MRs from templates that cover various QAs and tasks. In addition, we introduced novel metrics that integrate the ASR method into the semantic qualities of text to assess the effectiveness of MRs accurately. Through the experiments conducted with three prominent LLMs, we have confirmed that the METAL framework effectively evaluates essential QAs on primary LLM tasks and reveals the quality risks in LLMs. Moreover, the newly proposed metrics can guide the optimal MRs for testing each task and suggest the most effective method for generating MRs.

A common workaround is statistical downscaling (aka superresolution), where a low-resolution prediction is super-resolved using statistical approaches. While traditional computer vision tasks mainly focus on human perception or mean squared error, applications in weather and climate require capturing the conditional distribution of high-resolution patterns given low-resolution patterns so that reliable ensemble averages can be taken. Our approach relies on extending recent video diffusion models to precipitation superresolution: an optical flow on the high-resolution output induces temporally coherent predictions, whereas a temporally-conditioned diffusion model generates residuals that capture the correct noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on X-SHiELD, an established large-scale climate simulation dataset, and compare against two state-of-the-art baselines, focusing on CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, as well as an illustrative case -- the complex terrain of California.

Methods We formulated 7 key clinical NLP tasks as text-to-text learning and solved them using one unified generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, developed using GPT-3 architecture and trained with up to 20 billion parameters. We adopted soft prompts (i.e., trainable vectors) with frozen LLM, where the LLM parameters were not updated (i.e., frozen) and only the vectors of soft prompts were updated, known as prompt tuning. We added additional soft prompts as a prefix to the input layer, which were optimized during the prompt tuning.

Results and Conclusion The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance for 5 out of 7 major clinical NLP tasks using one unified generative LLM.

        "abstract": "Modern Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enjoy the same vision vocabulary -- CLIP, which can cover most common vision tasks. However, for some special vision task that needs dense and fine-grained vision perception, e.g., document-level OCR or chart understanding, especially in non-English scenarios, the CLIP-style vocabulary may encounter low efficiency in tokenizing the vision knowledge and even suffer out-of-vocabulary problem. Accordingly, we propose Vary, an efficient and effective method to scale up the vision vocabulary of LVLMs. The procedures of Vary are naturally divided into two folds: the generation and integration of a new vision vocabulary. In the first phase, we devise a vocabulary network along with a tiny decoder-only transformer to produce the desired vocabulary via autoregression. In the next, we scale up the vanilla vision vocabulary by merging the new one with the original one (CLIP), enabling the LVLMs can quickly garner new features. Compared to the popular BLIP-2, MiniGPT4, and LLaVA, Vary can maintain its vanilla capabilities while enjoying more excellent fine-grained perception and understanding ability. Specifically, Vary is competent in new document parsing features (OCR or markdown conversion) while achieving 78.2% ANLS in DocVQA and 36.2% in MMVet. Our code will be publicly available on the homepage. "

        "abstract": "3D Single Object Tracking (SOT) stands a forefront task of computer vision, proving essential for applications like autonomous driving. Sparse and occluded data in scene point clouds introduce variations in the appearance of tracked objects, adding complexity to the task. In this research, we unveil M3SOT, a novel 3D SOT framework, which synergizes multiple input frames (template sets), multiple receptive fields (continuous contexts), and multiple solution spaces (distinct tasks) in ONE model. Remarkably, M3SOT pioneers in modeling temporality, contexts, and tasks directly from point clouds, revisiting a perspective on the key factors influencing SOT. To this end, we design a transformer-based network centered on point cloud targets in the search area, aggregating diverse contextual representations and propagating target cues by employing historical frames. As M3SOT spans varied processing perspectives, we've streamlined the network-trimming its depth and optimizing its structure-to ensure a lightweight and efficient deployment for SOT applications. We posit that, backed by practical construction, M3SOT sidesteps the need for complex frameworks and auxiliary components to deliver sterling results. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that M3SOT achieves state-of-the-art performance at 38 FPS.

        "abstract": "In software engineering, the meticulous configuration of software tools is crucial in ensuring optimal performance within intricate systems. However, the complexity inherent in selecting optimal configurations is exacerbated by the high-dimensional search spaces presented in modern applications. Conventional trial-and-error or intuition-driven methods are both inefficient and error-prone, impeding scalability and reproducibility. In this study, we embark on an exploration of leveraging Large-Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the software configuration process. We identify that the task of hyperparameter configuration for machine learning components within intelligent applications is particularly challenging due to the extensive search space and performance-critical nature. Existing methods, including Bayesian optimization, have limitations regarding initial setup, computational cost, and convergence efficiency. Our work presents a novel approach that employs LLMs, such as Chat-GPT, to identify starting conditions and narrow down the search space, improving configuration efficiency. We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the variability of LLM-generated responses, uncovering intriguing findings such as potential response caching and consistent behavior based on domain-specific keywords. Furthermore, our results from hyperparameter optimization experiments reveal the potential of LLMs in expediting initialization processes and optimizing configurations. While our initial insights are promising, they also indicate the need for further in-depth investigations and experiments in this domain. "

The fast-paced evolution of generative language models such as GPT-4 has demonstrated outstanding results in various NLP generation tasks. However, due to the potential generation of offensive words related to race or gender, various Controllable Text Generation (CTG) methods have been proposed to mitigate the occurrence of harmful words. However, existing CTG methods not only reduce toxicity but also negatively impact several aspects of the language model's generation performance, including topic consistency, grammar, and perplexity. This paper explores the limitations of previous methods and introduces a novel solution in the form of a simple Gated Toxicity Avoidance (GTA) that can be applied to any CTG method. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GTA by comparing it with state-of-the-art CTG methods across various datasets. Our findings reveal that gated toxicity avoidance efficiently achieves comparable levels of toxicity reduction to the original CTG methods while preserving the generation performance of the language model.

        "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) necessitate the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Numerous studies have demonstrated that evolutionary computation is a promising paradigm for solving complex MOPs, which involve optimization problems with large-scale decision variables, many objectives, and expensive evaluation functions. However, existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) encounter significant challenges in generating high-quality populations when solving diverse complex MOPs. Specifically, the distinct requirements and constraints of the population result in the inefficiency or even incompetence of MOEAs in addressing various complex MOPs. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of pre-evolving for MOEAs to generate high-quality populations for diverse complex MOPs. Drawing inspiration from the classical transformer architecture, we devise dimension embedding and objective encoding techniques to configure the pre-evolved model (PEM). The PEM is pre-evolved on a substantial number of existing MOPs. Subsequently, when fine-evolving on new complex MOPs, the PEM transforms the population into the next generation to approximate the Pareto-optimal front. Furthermore, it utilizes evaluations on new solutions to iteratively update the PEM for subsequent generations, thereby efficiently solving various complex MOPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the PEM outperforms state-of-the-art MOEAs on a range of complex MOPs. "

Existing artistic style transfer methods can be divided into two categories: small model-based approaches and pre-trained large-scale model-based approaches. Small model-based approaches can preserve the content strucuture, but fail to produce highly realistic stylized images and introduce artifacts and disharmonious patterns; Pre-trained large-scale model-based approaches can generate highly realistic stylized images but struggle with preserving the content structure. To address the above issues, we propose ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework, to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving the content structure of the content images. Specifically, to sufficiently dig out the knowledge embedded in pre-trained large-scale models, an Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB), a set of trainable parameter matrices, is designed to learn and store knowledge from the collection of artworks and behave as a visual prompt to guide pre-trained large-scale models to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure. Besides, to accelerate training the above ISPB, we propose a novel Spatial-Statistical-based self-Attention Module (SSAM). The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods. "

        "abstract": "Siamese network-based trackers have shown remarkable success in aerial tracking. Most previous works, however, usually perform template matching only between the initial template and the search region and thus fail to deal with rapidly changing targets that often appear in aerial tracking. As a remedy, this work presents Building Appearance Collection Tracking (BACTrack). This simple yet effective tracking framework builds a dynamic collection of target templates online and performs efficient multi-template matching to achieve robust tracking. Specifically, BACTrack mainly comprises a Mixed-Temporal Transformer (MTT) and an appearance discriminator. The former is responsible for efficiently building relationships between the search region and multiple target templates in parallel through a mixed-temporal attention mechanism. At the same time, the appearance discriminator employs an online adaptive template-update strategy to ensure that the collected multiple templates remain reliable and diverse, allowing them to closely follow rapid changes in the target's appearance and suppress background interference during tracking. Extensive experiments show that our BACTrack achieves top performance on four challenging aerial tracking benchmarks while maintaining an impressive speed of over 87 FPS on a single GPU. Speed tests on embedded platforms also validate our potential suitability for deployment on UAV platforms. "

In contrast with prior works, which primarily focused on autonomous web navigation, we decompose the problem as an even atomic operation - Can LLMs identify the important information in the web page for a user given query? This decomposition enables us to scrutinize the current capabilities of LLMs and uncover the opportunities and challenges they present. Our empirical experiments show that while LLMs exhibit a reasonable level of performance in retrieving important UI elements, there is still a substantial room for improvement.

Additionally, undesired behaviors such as toxicity or hallucinations can manifest.

In this work, we propose formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness to instructions. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction, accomplished using LLMs, guides the text generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three distinct text generation tasks: keyword-constrained generation (Lin et al., 2020), toxicity reduction (Gehman et al., 2020), and factual correctness in question-answering (Gao et al., 2023).

        "abstract": "Image restoration has always been a cutting-edge topic in the academic and industrial fields of computer vision. Since degradation signals are often random and diverse, \"all-in-one\" models that can do blind image restoration have been concerned in recent years. Early works require training specialized headers and tails to handle each degradation of concern, which are manually cumbersome. Recent works focus on learning visual prompts from data distribution to identify degradation type. However, the prompts employed in most of models are non-text, lacking sufficient emphasis on the importance of human-in-the-loop. In this paper, an effective textual prompt guided image restoration model has been proposed. In this model, task-specific BERT is fine-tuned to accurately understand user's instructions and generating textual prompt guidance. Depth-wise multi-head transposed attentions and gated convolution modules are designed to bridge the gap between textual prompts and visual features. The proposed model has innovatively introduced semantic prompts into low-level visual domain. It highlights the potential to provide a natural, precise, and controllable way to perform image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments have been done on public denoising, dehazing and deraining datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that, compared with popular state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model can obtain much more superior performance, achieving accurate recognition and removal of degradation without increasing model's complexity.

This paper introduces RecJPQ, a novel adaptation of JPQ for sequential recommendations. We apply RecJPQ to SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GRU4rec models on three large-scale sequential datasets. Our results showed that RecJPQ could notably reduce the model size (e.g., 48x reduction for the Gowalla dataset with no effectiveness degradation).

However, current diagnostic methods only rely on a limited single-modal disease perspective, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we investigate a promising yet challenging way to fuse multimodal data for ACI diagnosis. Notably, existing fusion paradigms focus on empowering implicit modality interactions (i.e., self-attention and its variants), but neglect to inject explicit modality interactions, especially from clinical knowledge and imaging property. To this end, we propose a jointly Explicit and implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network (EiCI-Net) for Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis that uses anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, slit-lamp images, and clinical data jointly. Specifically, we first develop CNN-Based Encoders and Tabular Processing Module (TPM) to extract efficient feature representations in different modalities. Then, we devise an Explicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ECIM) to generate attention maps as a kind of explicit clinical knowledge based on the tabular feature maps, then integrated them into the slit-lamp feature maps, allowing the CNN-Based Encoder to focus on more effective informativeness of the slit-lamp images. After that, the Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ICIM), a transformer-based network, further implicitly enhances modality interactions. Finally, we construct a considerable real-world dataset from our collaborative hospital and conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed EiCI-Net compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods in various metrics.

We propose a Dynamic Weighted Combiner (DWC) to tackle the above challenges, which includes three merits. First, we propose an Editable Modality De-equalizer (EMD) by taking into account the contribution disparity between modalities, containing two modality feature editors and an adaptive weighted combiner. Second, to alleviate labeling noises and data bias, we propose a dynamic soft-similarity label generator (SSG) to implicitly improve noisy supervision. Finally, to bridge modality gaps and facilitate similarity learning, we propose a CLIP-based mutual enhancement module alternately trained by a mixed-modality contrastive loss.

        "abstract": "Since its introduction in 2017, Transformer has emerged as the leading neural network architecture, catalyzing revolutionary advancements in many AI disciplines. The key innovation in Transformer is a Self-Attention (SA) mechanism designed to capture contextual information. However, extending the original Transformer design to models of greater depth has proven exceedingly challenging, if not impossible. Even though various modifications have been proposed in order to stack more layers of SA mechanism into deeper models, a full understanding of this depth problem remains elusive. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation, both theoretically and empirically, to substantiate the claim that the depth problem is caused by \\emph{token similarity escalation}; that is, tokens grow increasingly alike after repeated applications of the SA mechanism. Our analysis reveals that, driven by the invariant leading eigenspace and large spectral gaps of attention matrices, token similarity provably escalates at a linear rate. Based on the gained insight, we propose a simple strategy that, unlike most existing methods, surgically removes excessive similarity without discounting the SA mechanism as a whole. Preliminary experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach on moderate-scale post-norm Transformer models. "

Some recent research efforts have been devoted to self-supervised music representation learning. Nevertheless, most of them learn to represent equally-sized music clips in the waveform or a spectrogram. Despite being effective in some tasks, learning music representations in such a manner largely neglect the inherent part-whole hierarchies of music. Due to the hierarchical nature of the auditory cortex [24], understanding the bottom-up structure of music, i.e., how different parts constitute the whole at different levels, is essential for music understanding and representation learning. This work pursues hierarchical music representation learning and introduces the Music-PAW framework, which enables feature interactions of cropped music clips with part-whole hierarchies. From a technical perspective, we propose a transformer-based part-whole interaction module to progressively reason the structural relationships between part-whole music clips at adjacent levels. Besides, to create a multi-hierarchy representation space, we devise a hierarchical contrastive learning objective to align part-whole music representations in adjacent hierarchies. The merits of audio representation learning from part-whole hierarchies have been validated on various downstream tasks, including music classification (single-label and multi-label), cover song identification and acoustic scene classification.

However, issues such as the lack of consistency in synthesized views and over-smoothing in extracted geometry persist. Previous methods integrate multi-view consistency modules or impose additional supervisory to enhance view consistency while compromising on the flexibility of camera positioning and limiting the versatility of view synthesis. In this study, we consider the radiance field optimized during geometry extraction as a more rigid consistency prior, compared to volume and ray aggregation used in previous works. We further identify and rectify a critical bias in the traditional radiance field optimization process through score distillation from a multi-view diffuser. We introduce an Unbiased Score Distillation (USD) that utilizes unconditioned noises from a 2D diffusion model, greatly refining the radiance field fidelity. we leverage the rendered views from the optimized radiance field as the basis and develop a two-step specialization process of a 2D diffusion model, which is adept at conducting object-specific denoising and generating high-quality multi-view images. Finally, we recover faithful geometry and texture directly from the refined multi-view images. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our optimized geometry and view distillation technique generates comparable results to the state-of-the-art models trained on extensive datasets, all while maintaining freedom in camera positioning.

Concurrently, edge computing, as an evolutionary paradigm of computing in communication systems, effectively augments real-time interactive services.

Nevertheless, this approach faces constraints imposed by battery life and computational resources when tasks are offloaded to local devices, limiting the capacity to deliver high-quality content to users while adhering to stringent latency requirements. So there will be a tradeoff between the utility of AIGC models and offloading decisions in the edge computing paradigm. This paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm for offloading decisions, computation time, and diffusion steps of the diffusion models in the reverse diffusion stage. Moreover, we take the average error into consideration as the metric for evaluating the quality of the generated results. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior joint optimization performance compared to the baselines. "

In a poisoning attack, an attacker intentionally injects maliciously crafted insecure code snippets into training datasets to manipulate these tools. The poisoned tools can suggest insecure code to developers, resulting in vulnerabilities in their products that attackers can exploit. However, it is still little understood whether such poisoning attacks against the tools would be practical in real-world settings and how developers address the poisoning attacks during software development. To understand the real-world impact of poisoning attacks on developers who rely on AI-powered coding assistants, we conducted two user studies: an online survey and an in-lab study. The online survey involved 238 participants, including software developers and computer science students. The survey results revealed widespread adoption of these tools among participants, primarily to enhance coding speed, eliminate repetition, and gain boilerplate code. However, the survey also found that developers may misplace trust in these tools because they overlooked the risk of poisoning attacks. The in-lab study was conducted with 30 professional developers. The developers were asked to complete three programming tasks with a representative type of AI-powered coding assistant tool, running on Visual Studio Code. The in-lab study results showed that developers using a poisoned ChatGPT-like tool were more prone to including insecure code than those using an IntelliCode-like tool or no tool.

These CD embeddings will then serve as the input for the transformer decoder. Results on public datasets show that EEND-TA achieves 2.68% absolute DER improvement over EEND-EDA. EEND-TA inference is 1.28 times faster than that of EEND-EDA. "

However, ICPS encounters various challenges in long-term operation, including equipment failures, performance degradation, and security threats. To achieve efficient maintenance and management, prognostics and health management (PHM) finds widespread application in ICPS for critical tasks, including failure prediction, health monitoring, and maintenance decision-making. The emergence of large-scale foundation models (LFMs) like BERT and GPT signifies a significant advancement in AI technology, and ChatGPT stands as a remarkable accomplishment within this research paradigm, harboring potential for General Artificial Intelligence. Considering the ongoing enhancement in data acquisition technology and data processing capability, LFMs are anticipated to assume a crucial role in the PHM domain of ICPS. However, at present, a consensus is lacking regarding the application of LFMs to PHM in ICPS, necessitating systematic reviews and roadmaps to elucidate future directions. To bridge this gap, this paper elucidates the key components and recent advances in the underlying model.A comprehensive examination and comprehension of the latest advances in grand modeling for PHM in ICPS can offer valuable references for decision makers and researchers in the industrial field while facilitating further enhancements in the reliability, availability, and safety of ICPS.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models achieve remarkable quality in image generation, but at a cost. Iterative denoising requires many time steps to produce high fidelity images. We argue that the denoising process is crucially limited by an accumulation of the reconstruction error due to an initial inaccurate reconstruction of the target data. This leads to lower quality outputs, and slower convergence. To address this issue, we propose compensation sampling to guide the generation towards the target domain. We introduce a compensation term, implemented as a U-Net, which adds negligible computation overhead during training and, optionally, inference. Our approach is flexible and we demonstrate its application in unconditional generation, face inpainting, and face de-occlusion using benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ, FFHQ-256, and FSG. Our approach consistently yields state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality, while accelerating the denoising process to converge during training by up to an order of magnitude. "

We then use the rank of each augmented tag in a list as a relative relevance label to contrast each top-ranked tag with a set of lower-ranked tags. This learning objective encourages the top-ranked tags to be more compatible with their image and text context than lower-ranked tags, thus improving the discriminative ability of the learned multi-modality representation. We evaluate our approach on two datasets and show that our proposed RCA-NOC approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving vision-language representation for novel object captioning.

The existing evaluation methods have many constraints, and their results exhibit a limited degree of interpretability. In this work, we propose a bias evaluation framework named GPTBIAS that leverages the high performance of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 \\cite{openai2023gpt4}) to assess bias in models. We also introduce prompts called Bias Attack Instructions, which are specifically designed for evaluating model bias. To enhance the credibility and interpretability of bias evaluation, our framework not only provides a bias score but also offers detailed information, including bias types, affected demographics, keywords, reasons behind the biases, and suggestions for improvement.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06323",
        "abstract": "Prompt learning has become a prevalent strategy for adapting vision-language foundation models to downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have emerged, recent studies have explored the use of category-related descriptions as input to enhance prompt effectiveness. Nevertheless, conventional descriptions fall short of structured information that effectively represents the interconnections among entities or attributes linked to a particular category. To address this limitation and prioritize harnessing structured knowledge, this paper advocates for leveraging LLMs to build a graph for each description to model the entities and attributes describing the category, as well as their correlations. Preexisting prompt tuning methods exhibit inadequacies in managing this structured knowledge. Consequently, we propose a novel approach called Hierarchical Prompt Tuning (HPT), which enables simultaneous modeling of both structured and conventional linguistic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a relationship-guided attention module to capture pair-wise associations among entities and attributes for low-level prompt learning. In addition, by incorporating high-level and global-level prompts modeling overall semantics, the proposed hierarchical structure forges cross-level interlinks and empowers the model to handle more complex and long-term relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HPT shows strong effectiveness and generalizes much better than existing SOTA methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vill-Lab/2024-AAAI-HPT. "

        "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to solve the problem of defining reward functions in real-world decision-making tasks. The current popular approach is the Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) framework, which matches expert state-action occupancy measures to obtain a surrogate reward for forward reinforcement learning. However, the traditional discriminator is a simple binary classifier and doesn't learn an accurate distribution, which may result in failing to identify expert-level state-action pairs induced by the policy interacting with the environment. To address this issue, we propose a method named diffusion adversarial imitation learning (DiffAIL), which introduces the diffusion model into the AIL framework. Specifically, DiffAIL models the state-action pairs as unconditional diffusion models and uses diffusion loss as part of the discriminator's learning objective, which enables the discriminator to capture better expert demonstrations and improve generalization. Experimentally, the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly surpasses expert demonstration on two benchmark tasks, including the standard state-action setting and state-only settings.

One strategy of using LLMs for autonomous driving involves inputting surrounding objects as text prompts to the LLMs, along with their coordinate and velocity information, and then outputting the subsequent movements of the vehicle. When using LLMs for such purposes, capabilities such as spatial recognition and planning are essential. In particular, two foundational capabilities are required: (1) spatial-aware decision making, which is the ability to recognize space from coordinate information and make decisions to avoid collisions, and (2) the ability to adhere to traffic rules. However, quantitative research has not been conducted on how accurately different types of LLMs can handle these problems. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated these two abilities of LLMs in the context of autonomous driving. Furthermore, to conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) for the feasibility of implementing these abilities in actual vehicles, we developed a system that uses LLMs to drive a vehicle. "

        "abstract": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) require fine-tuning to improve their responsiveness to natural language instructions. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to perform fine-tuning using the abundant data on end devices without compromising data privacy. Most existing federated fine-tuning methods for LLMs rely on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, which may not reach the performance heights possible with full-parameter tuning. However, the communication overhead associated with full-parameter tuning is prohibitively high for both servers and clients. This work introduces FedKSeed, a novel approach that employs zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) with a set of random seeds. It enables federated full-parameter tuning of billion-sized LLMs directly on devices. Our method significantly reduces transmission requirements between the server and clients to just a few scalar gradients and random seeds, amounting to only a few thousand bytes. Building on this, we develop a strategy to assess the significance of ZOO perturbations for FL, allowing for probability-differentiated seed sampling. This prioritizes perturbations that have a greater impact on model accuracy. Experiments across six scenarios with different LLMs, datasets and data partitions demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing federated LLM fine-tuning methods in terms of both communication efficiency and new task generalization.

PortraitBooth leverages subject embeddings from a face recognition model for personalized image generation without fine-tuning. It eliminates computational overhead and mitigates identity distortion.

However, existing prompt tuning based frameworks need to parallelize learnable textual inputs for all categories, suffering from massive GPU memory consumption when there is a large number of categories in the target dataset. Moreover, previous works require to include category names within prompts, exhibiting subpar performance when dealing with ambiguous category names. To address these shortcomings, we propose Compound Text-Guided Prompt Tuning (TGP-T) that significantly reduces resource demand while achieving superior performance. We introduce text supervision to the optimization of prompts, which enables two benefits: 1) releasing the model reliance on the pre-defined category names during inference, thereby enabling more flexible prompt generation; 2) reducing the number of inputs to the text encoder, which decreases GPU memory consumption significantly. Specifically, we found that compound text supervisions, i.e., category-wise and content-wise, is highly effective, since they provide inter-class separability and capture intra-class variations, respectively. Moreover, we condition the prompt generation on visual features through a module called Bonder, which facilitates the alignment between prompts and visual features. Extensive experiments on few-shot recognition and domain generalization demonstrate that TGP-T achieves superior performance with consistently lower training costs. It reduces GPU memory usage by 93% and attains a 2.5% performance gain on 16-shot ImageNet. The code is available at https://github.com/EricTan7/TGP-T. "

The state-of-the-art solutions devoted to such a vision-based scheme typically incorporate predefined rules or unsupervised iterative feedback, struggling with multi-fold challenges such as lack of open-source datasets for training the whole pipeline, and the vulnerability to the noises from visual inputs. In response to the dilemma, this paper proposes VisionTraj, the first learning-based model that reconstructs vehicle trajectories from snapshots recorded by road network cameras. Coupled with it, we elaborate on two rational vision-trajectory datasets, which produce extensive trajectory data along with corresponding visual snapshots, enabling supervised vision-trajectory interplay extraction. Following the data creation, based on the results from the off-the-shelf multi-modal vehicle clustering, we first re-formulate the trajectory recovery problem as a generative task and introduce the canonical Transformer as the autoregressive backbone. Then, to identify clustering noises (e.g., false positives) with the bound on the snapshots' spatiotemporal dependencies, a GCN-based soft-denoising module is conducted based on the fine- and coarse-grained Re-ID clusters. Additionally, we harness strong semantic information extracted from the tracklet to provide detailed insights into the vehicle's entry and exit actions during trajectory recovery. The denoising and tracklet components can also act as plug-and-play modules to boost baselines. Experimental results on the two hand-crafted datasets show that the proposed VisionTraj achieves a maximum +11.5% improvement against the sub-best model. "

With the success of text-to-image diffusion models, the 2D-lifting technique becomes a promising route to controllable 3D generation. However, these methods tend to present inconsistent geometry, which is also known as the Janus problem. We observe that the problem is caused mainly by two aspects, i.e., viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models and overfitting of the optimization objective. To address it, we propose a two-stage 2D-lifting framework, namely DreamControl, which optimizes coarse NeRF scenes as 3D self-prior and then generates fine-grained objects with control-based score distillation. Specifically, adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric are proposed to ensure the consistency of generated priors. The priors are then regarded as input conditions to maintain reasonable geometries, in which conditional LoRA and weighted score are further proposed to optimize detailed textures. DreamControl can generate high-quality 3D content in terms of both geometry consistency and texture fidelity. Moreover, our control-based optimization guidance is applicable to more downstream tasks, including user-guided generation and 3D animation.

Current methods typically utilize task contexts and skills as prior experience, where task contexts are related to the information within each task and skills represent a set of temporally extended actions for solving subtasks. However, these methods still suffer from limited performance when adapting to unseen target tasks, mainly because the learned prior experience lacks generalization, i.e., they are unable to extract effective prior experience from meta-training tasks by exploration and learning of continuous latent spaces. We propose a framework called decoupled meta-reinforcement learning (DCMRL), which (1) contrastively restricts the learning of task contexts through pulling in similar task contexts within the same task and pushing away different task contexts of different tasks, and (2) utilizes a Gaussian quantization variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE) for clustering the Gaussian distributions of the task contexts and skills respectively, and decoupling the exploration and learning processes of their spaces. These cluster centers which serve as representative and discrete distributions of task context and skill are stored in task context codebook and skill codebook, respectively. DCMRL can acquire generalizable prior experience and achieve effective adaptation to unseen target tasks during the meta-testing phase. Experiments in the navigation and robot manipulation continuous control tasks show that DCMRL is more effective than previous meta-RL methods with more generalizable prior experience. "

This challenge is exacerbated by the extensive use of Softmax and data-dependent matrix multiplications within the attention mechanism. Furthermore, existing IMC designs encounter difficulties in fully harnessing the benefits of analog MVM acceleration due to the area and energy-intensive nature of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel Compute Analog Content Addressable Memory (Compute-ACAM) structure capable of performing various non-MVM operations within Transformers. Together with the crossbar structure, our proposed RACE-IT accelerator enables efficient execution of all operations within Transformer models in the analog domain. Given the flexibility of our proposed Compute-ACAMs to perform arbitrary operations, RACE-IT exhibits adaptability to diverse non-traditional and future DNN architectures without necessitating hardware modifications. Leveraging the capability of Compute-ACAMs to process analog input and produce digital output, we also replace ADCs, thereby reducing the overall area and energy costs. By evaluating various Transformer models against state-of-the-art GPUs and existing IMC accelerators, RACE-IT increases performance by 10.7x and 5.9x, and reduces energy by 1193x, and 3.9x, respectively "

        "abstract": "The recent surge in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA, Falcon, and Mistral, provides diverse options for AI practitioners and researchers. However, most LLMs have only released partial artifacts, such as the final model weights or inference code, and technical reports increasingly limit their scope to high-level design choices and surface statistics. These choices hinder progress in the field by degrading transparency into the training of LLMs and forcing teams to rediscover many details in the training process. We present LLM360, an initiative to fully open-source LLMs, which advocates for all training code and data, model checkpoints, and intermediate results to be made available to the community. The goal of LLM360 is to support open and collaborative AI research by making the end-to-end LLM training process transparent and reproducible by everyone. As a first step of LLM360, we release two 7B parameter LLMs pre-trained from scratch, Amber and CrystalCoder, including their training code, data, intermediate checkpoints, and analyses (at https://www.llm360.ai). We are committed to continually pushing the boundaries of LLMs through this open-source effort. More large-scale and stronger models are underway and will be released in the future. "

        "abstract": "We address the problem of generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) driven by textual prompts. Instead of a single model, our key insight is to take a modular design and decompose the complex task into simpler sub-tasks. We first develop a dual-branch diffusion model (HOI-DM) to generate both human and object motions conditioning on the input text, and encourage coherent motions by a cross-attention communication module between the human and object motion generation branches. We also develop an affordance prediction diffusion model (APDM) to predict the contacting area between the human and object during the interactions driven by the textual prompt. The APDM is independent of the results by the HOI-DM and thus can correct potential errors by the latter. Moreover, it stochastically generates the contacting points to diversify the generated motions. Finally, we incorporate the estimated contacting points into the classifier-guidance to achieve accurate and close contact between humans and objects. To train and evaluate our approach, we annotate BEHAVE dataset with text descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to produce realistic HOIs with various interactions and different types of objects. "

Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts. We call these approaches meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe them. This framework is flexible enough to account for LLM stochasticity; and allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. We experiment with meta-prompting in two active areas of model research: creativity and ideation. We find that user preference favors (p < 0.01) the prompts generated under meta-prompting, as well as their corresponding outputs, over a series of hardcoded baseline prompts that include the original task prompt. Using our framework, we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs. "

This achievement was realized by integrating GPT-4 into our proprietary android, Alter3, thereby effectively grounding the LLM with Alter's bodily movement. Typically, low-level robot control is hardware-dependent and falls outside the scope of LLM corpora, presenting challenges for direct LLM-based robot control. However, in the case of humanoid robots like Alter3, direct control is feasible by mapping the linguistic expressions of human actions onto the robot's body through program code. Remarkably, this approach enables Alter3 to adopt various poses, such as a 'selfie' stance or 'pretending to be a ghost,' and generate sequences of actions over time without explicit programming for each body part. This demonstrates the robot's zero-shot learning capabilities. Additionally, verbal feedback can adjust poses, obviating the need for fine-tuning.

        "abstract": "The field of image synthesis has made tremendous strides forward in the last years. Besides defining the desired output image with text-prompts, an intuitive approach is to additionally use spatial guidance in form of an image, such as a depth map. For this, a recent and highly popular approach is to use a controlling network, such as ControlNet, in combination with a pre-trained image generation model, such as Stable Diffusion. When evaluating the design of existing controlling networks, we observe that they all suffer from the same problem of a delay in information flowing between the generation and controlling process. This, in turn, means that the controlling network must have generative capabilities. In this work we propose a new controlling architecture, called ControlNet-XS, which does not suffer from this problem, and hence can focus on the given task of learning to control. In contrast to ControlNet, our model needs only a fraction of parameters, and hence is about twice as fast during inference and training time. Furthermore, the generated images are of higher quality and the control is of higher fidelity. All code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available. "

        "abstract": "Training on large-scale datasets can boost the performance of video instance segmentation while the annotated datasets for VIS are hard to scale up due to the high labor cost. What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly train models across the aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. However, due to the heterogeneity in category space, as mask precision increases with the data volume, simply utilizing multiple datasets will dilute the attention of models on different taxonomies. Thus, increasing the data scale and enriching taxonomy space while improving classification precision is important. In this work, we analyze that providing extra taxonomy information can help models concentrate on specific taxonomy, and propose our model named Taxonomy-aware Multi-dataset Joint Training for Video Instance Segmentation (TMT-VIS) to address this vital challenge. Specifically, we design a two-stage taxonomy aggregation module that first compiles taxonomy information from input videos and then aggregates these taxonomy priors into instance queries before the transformer decoder. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on four popular and challenging benchmarks, including YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and UVO. Our model shows significant improvement over the baseline solutions, and sets new state-of-the-art records on all benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear (with respect to output length) inference complexity. Recent works such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin et al., 2023a) observe that adding a global decay term to the additive RNN update rule greatly improves performance, sometimes outperforming standard Transformers with softmax attention when trained at scale. In this work we show that adding a data-dependent gating mechanism further improves performance. We derive a parallel form of this gated linear attention layer that enables efficient training. However, a straightforward, numerically stable implementation of this parallel form requires generalized matrix multiplications in log-space for numerical stability, and thus cannot take advantage of tensor cores on modern GPUs which are optimized for standard matrix multiplications. We develop a hardware-efficient version of the parallel form that can still make use of tensor cores through block-parallel computations over sequence chunks. Experiments on moderate-scale language modeling (340M-parameter models trained on 15B tokens, 1.3B-parameter models trained on 100B tokens) show that gated linear attention (GLA) Transformers perform competitively against a strong LLaMA-architecture Transformer baseline (Touvron et al., 2023) as well as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023), a recently introduced state-space model with a data-dependent state transition mechanism. For training speed, our Triton-based implementation performs comparably to CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) under the regular 2048 training length setting, while outperforming FlashAttention-2 when training on longer sequences beyond 4096.

Our study introduces Upscale-A-Video, a text-guided latent diffusion framework for video upscaling. This framework ensures temporal coherence through two key mechanisms: locally, it integrates temporal layers into U-Net and VAE-Decoder, maintaining consistency within short sequences; globally, without training, a flow-guided recurrent latent propagation module is introduced to enhance overall video stability by propagating and fusing latent across the entire sequences. Thanks to the diffusion paradigm, our model also offers greater flexibility by allowing text prompts to guide texture creation and adjustable noise levels to balance restoration and generation, enabling a trade-off between fidelity and quality. Extensive experiments show that Upscale-A-Video surpasses existing methods in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as in AI-generated videos, showcasing impressive visual realism and temporal consistency.

Inspired by cognition theories, AnyHome employs an amodal structured representation to capture 3D spatial cues from textual narratives and then uses egocentric inpainting to enrich these scenes. To this end, we begin by using specially designed template prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable precise control over the textual input. We then utilize intermediate representations to maintain the spatial structure's consistency, ensuring that the 3D scenes align closely with the textual description. Then, we apply a Score Distillation Sampling process to refine the placement of objects. Lastly, an egocentric inpainting process is incorporated to enhance the realism and appearance of the scenes. AnyHome stands out due to its hierarchical structured representation combined with the versatility of open-vocabulary text interpretation. This allows for extensive customization of indoor scenes at various levels of granularity. We demonstrate that AnyHome can reliably generate a range of diverse indoor scenes, characterized by their detailed spatial structures and textures, all corresponding to the free-form textual inputs.

        "abstract": "Recently, 3D content creation from text prompts has demonstrated remarkable progress by utilizing 2D and 3D diffusion models. While 3D diffusion models ensure great multi-view consistency, their ability to generate high-quality and diverse 3D assets is hindered by the limited 3D data. In contrast, 2D diffusion models find a distillation approach that achieves excellent generalization and rich details without any 3D data. However, 2D lifting methods suffer from inherent view-agnostic ambiguity thereby leading to serious multi-face Janus issues, where text prompts fail to provide sufficient guidance to learn coherent 3D results. Instead of retraining a costly viewpoint-aware model, we study how to fully exploit easily accessible coarse 3D knowledge to enhance the prompts and guide 2D lifting optimization for refinement. In this paper, we propose Sherpa3D, a new text-to-3D framework that achieves high-fidelity, generalizability, and geometric consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we design a pair of guiding strategies derived from the coarse 3D prior generated by the 3D diffusion model: a structural guidance for geometric fidelity and a semantic guidance for 3D coherence. Employing the two types of guidance, the 2D diffusion model enriches the 3D content with diversified and high-quality results. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our Sherpa3D over the state-of-the-art text-to-3D methods in terms of quality and 3D consistency. "

Current sparse-view 3D inference methods typically rely on camera poses to geometrically aggregate information from input views, but are not robust in-the-wild when such information is unavailable/inaccurate. In contrast, UpFusion sidesteps this requirement by learning to implicitly leverage the available images as context in a conditional generative model for synthesizing novel views. We incorporate two complementary forms of conditioning into diffusion models for leveraging the input views: a) via inferring query-view aligned features using a scene-level transformer, b) via intermediate attentional layers that can directly observe the input image tokens. We show that this mechanism allows generating high-fidelity novel views while improving the synthesis quality given additional (unposed) images. We evaluate our approach on the Co3Dv2 and Google Scanned Objects datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our method over pose-reliant sparse-view methods as well as single-view methods that cannot leverage additional views. Finally, we also show that our learned model can generalize beyond the training categories and even allow reconstruction from self-captured images of generic objects in-the-wild. "

Most of these models rely on the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) algorithm to optimize a 3D representation such that the rendered image maintains a high likelihood as evaluated by a pre-trained diffusion model. However, finding a correct mode in the high-dimensional distribution produced by the diffusion model is challenging and often leads to issues such as over-saturation, over-smoothing, and Janus-like artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm for 3D synthesis that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models.

The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neural networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperform the other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics.

We show that conditional generation guided by XANES spectra reproduces key features of the target structures. Furthermore, we show that our model can steer the generative process to tailor atomic arrangements for a specific XANES spectrum. Finally, our generative model exhibits a remarkable scale-agnostic property, thereby enabling generation of realistic, large-scale structures through learning from a small-scale dataset (i.e., with small unit cells).

In our proposed CSI model, we incorporate an adaptive diffusion term to address the instability issues arising during the training process. We provide explicit forms of the conditional score function and the drift function in terms of conditional expectations under mild conditions, which naturally lead to an nonparametric regression approach to estimating these functions.

However, due to individual differences and complex clinical situations, even seasoned expert teams may need help to achieve the best treatment plan every time quickly. Many automatic dose distribution prediction methods have been proposed recently to accelerate the radiation therapy planning process and have achieved good results. However, these results suffer from over-smoothing issues, with the obtained dose distribution maps needing more high-frequency details, limiting their clinical application. To address these limitations, we propose a dose prediction diffusion model based on SwinTransformer and a projector, SP-DiffDose. To capture the direct correlation between anatomical structure and dose distribution maps, SP-DiffDose uses a structural encoder to extract features from anatomical images, then employs a conditional diffusion process to blend noise and anatomical images at multiple scales and gradually map them to dose distribution maps. To enhance the dose prediction distribution for organs at risk, SP-DiffDose utilizes SwinTransformer in the deeper layers of the network to capture features at different scales in the image. To learn good representations from the fused features, SP-DiffDose passes the fused features through a designed projector, improving dose prediction accuracy. Finally, we evaluate SP-DiffDose on an internal dataset. The results show that SP-DiffDose outperforms existing methods on multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating the superiority and generalizability of our method. "

        "abstract": "Directly predicting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status from widely available hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) can reduce technical costs and expedite treatment selection. Accurately predicting HER2 requires large collections of multi-site WSIs. Federated learning enables collaborative training of these WSIs without gigabyte-size WSIs transportation and data privacy concerns. However, federated learning encounters challenges in addressing label imbalance in multi-site WSIs from the real world. Moreover, existing WSI classification methods cannot simultaneously exploit local context information and long-range dependencies in the site-end feature representation of federated learning. To address these issues, we present a point transformer with federated learning for multi-site HER2 status prediction from HE-stained WSIs. Our approach incorporates two novel designs. We propose a dynamic label distribution strategy and an auxiliary classifier, which helps to establish a well-initialized model and mitigate label distribution variations across sites. Additionally, we propose a farthest cosine sampling based on cosine distance. It can sample the most distinctive features and capture the long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments and analysis show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at four sites with a total of 2687 WSIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can generalize to two unseen sites with 229 WSIs. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06619",
        "abstract": "Scale-free networks are one of the most famous examples of emergent behavior and are ubiquitous in social systems, especially online social media in which users can follow each other. By analyzing the interactions of multiple generative agents using GPT3.5-turbo as a language model, we demonstrate their ability to not only mimic individual human linguistic behavior but also exhibit collective phenomena intrinsic to human societies, in particular the emergence of scale-free networks. We discovered that this process is disrupted by a skewed token prior distribution of GPT3.5-turbo, which can lead to networks with extreme centralization as a kind of alignment. We show how renaming agents removes these token priors and allows the model to generate a range of networks from random networks to more realistic scale-free networks. "
