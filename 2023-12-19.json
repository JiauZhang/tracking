        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10055",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models possess skills such as answering questions, writing essays or solving programming exercises. Since these models are easily accessible, researchers have investigated their capabilities and risks for programming education. This work explores how LLMs can contribute to programming education by supporting students with automated next-step hints. We investigate prompt practices that lead to effective next-step hints and use these insights to build our StAP-tutor. We evaluate this tutor by conducting an experiment with students, and performing expert assessments. Our findings show that most LLM-generated feedback messages describe one specific next step and are personalised to the student's code and approach. However, the hints may contain misleading information and lack sufficient detail when students approach the end of the assignment. This work demonstrates the potential for LLM-generated feedback, but further research is required to explore its practical implementation. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10057",
        "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in research across all disciplines is becoming ubiquitous. However, this ubiquity is largely driven by hyperspecific AI models developed during scientific studies for accomplishing a well-defined, data-dense task. These AI models introduce apparent, human-recognizable biases because they are trained with finite, specific data sets and parameters. However, the efficacy of using large language models (LLMs) -- and LLM-powered generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT -- to assist the research process is currently indeterminate. These generative AI tools, trained on general and imperceptibly large datasets along with human feedback, present challenges in identifying and addressing biases. Furthermore, these models are susceptible to goal misgeneralization, hallucinations, and adversarial attacks such as red teaming prompts -- which can be unintentionally performed by human researchers, resulting in harmful outputs. These outputs are reinforced in research -- where an increasing number of individuals have begun to use generative AI to compose manuscripts. Efforts into AI interpretability lag behind development, and the implicit variations that occur when prompting and providing context to a chatbot introduce uncertainty and irreproducibility. We thereby find that incorporating generative AI in the process of writing research manuscripts introduces a new type of context-induced algorithmic bias and has unintended side effects that are largely detrimental to academia, knowledge production, and communicating research.

We identify and curate a list of 220 principles from literature, and derive a set of 37 core principles organized into seven categories: assumptions and perspectives, reasoning, information and evidence, robustness and security, ethics, utility, and implications. We conduct a small-scale expert survey, eliciting the subjective importance experts assign to different principles and lay out avenues for future work beyond our preliminary results. We envision that the development of a shared model of principles can serve multiple purposes: monitoring and steering models at inference time, improving model behavior during training, and guiding human evaluation of model reasoning.

We propose methods that use synthetic images to probe two applications of diffusion models, image editing and classification, for social bias. Using our methodology, we uncover meaningful and significant inter-sectional social biases in \\textit{Stable Diffusion}, a state-of-the-art open-source text-to-image model.

        "abstract": "Pretrained representations from large-scale vision models have boosted the performance of downstream embodied policy learning. We look to understand whether additional self-supervised pretraining on exploration trajectories can build on these general-purpose visual representations to better support embodied planning in realistic environments. We evaluated four common auxiliary losses in embodied AI, two hindsight-based losses, and a standard imitation learning loss, by pretraining the agent's visual compression module and state belief representations with each objective and using CLIP as a representative visual backbone. The learned representations are then frozen for downstream multi-step evaluation on two goal-directed tasks. Surprisingly, we find that imitation learning on these exploration trajectories out-performs all other auxiliary losses even despite the exploration trajectories being dissimilar from the downstream tasks. This suggests that imitation of exploration may be ''all you need'' for building powerful planning representations. Additionally, we find that popular auxiliary losses can benefit from simple modifications to improve their support for downstream planning ability. "

        "abstract": "The fields of AI current lacks methods to quantitatively assess and potentially alter the moral values inherent in the output of large language models (LLMs). However, decades of social science research has developed and refined widely-accepted moral value surveys, such as the World Values Survey (WVS), eliciting value judgments from direct questions in various geographies. We have turned those questions into value statements and use NLP to compute to how well popular LLMs are aligned with moral values for various demographics and cultures. While the WVS is accepted as an explicit assessment of values, we lack methods for assessing implicit moral and cultural values in media, e.g., encountered in social media, political rhetoric, narratives, and generated by AI systems such as LLMs that are increasingly present in our daily lives. As we consume online content and utilize LLM outputs, we might ask, which moral values are being implicitly promoted or undercut, or -- in the case of LLMs -- if they are intending to represent a cultural identity, are they doing so consistently? In this paper we utilize a Recognizing Value Resonance (RVR) NLP model to identify WVS values that resonate and conflict with a given passage of output text. We apply RVR to the text generated by LLMs to characterize implicit moral values, allowing us to quantify the moral/cultural distance between LLMs and various demographics that have been surveyed using the WVS. In line with other work we find that LLMs exhibit several Western-centric value biases; they overestimate how conservative people in non-Western countries are, they are less accurate in representing gender for non-Western countries, and portray older populations as having more traditional values. Our results highlight value misalignment and age groups, and a need for social science informed technological solutions addressing value plurality in LLMs. "

We conduct a detailed analysis of real-world ChatGPT datasets with multi-turn conversations between users and ChatGPT. Through a multi-pronged approach, we quantify conversation dynamics by examining the number of turns, then gauge sentiment to understand user sentiment variations, and finally employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discern overarching topics within the conversation. By understanding shifts in user demographics and interests, we aim to shed light on the changing nature of human-AI interaction and anticipate future trends in user engagement with language models. "

This paper delves into the transition from individual coding problems to repository-scale solutions, presenting a thorough review of the current literature on effective LLM prompting for code generation at the repository level. We examine approaches that will work with black-box LLMs such that they will be useful and applicable to commercial use cases, and their applicability in interpreting code at a repository scale. We juxtapose the Repository-Level Prompt Generation technique with RepoCoder, an iterative retrieval and generation method, to highlight the trade-offs inherent in each approach and to establish best practices for their application in cutting-edge coding benchmarks. The interplay between iterative refinement of prompts and the development of advanced retrieval systems forms the core of our discussion, offering a pathway to significantly improve LLM performance in code generation tasks. Insights from this study not only guide the application of these methods but also chart a course for future research to integrate such techniques into broader software engineering contexts. "

        "abstract": "Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) extends the scope of classic RES to referring to multiple objects in one expression or identifying the empty targets absent in the image. GRES poses challenges in modeling the complex spatial relationships of the instances in the image and identifying non-existing referents. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown tremendous progress in these complicated vision-language tasks. Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models, MLLMs are proficient in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them, LISA, as a representative, adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask decoder, e.g., SAM, to enable MLLMs in the RES task. However, existing solutions to of GRES remain unsatisfactory since current segmentation MLLMs cannot properly handle the cases where users might reference multiple subjects in a singular prompt or provide descriptions incongruent with any image target. In this paper, we propose Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA) to address this gap. Specifically, GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the null targets explicitly. Experiments validate GSVA's efficacy in resolving the GRES issue, marking a notable enhancement and setting a new record on the GRES benchmark gRefCOCO dataset. GSVA also proves effective across various classic referring expression segmentation and comprehension tasks. "

        "abstract": "With the help of Score Distillation Sampling(SDS) and the rapid development of various trainable 3D representations, Text-to-Image(T2I) diffusion models have been applied to 3D generation tasks and achieved considerable results. There are also some attempts toward the task of editing 3D objects leveraging this Text-to-3D pipeline. However, most methods currently focus on adding additional geometries, overwriting textures or both. But few of them can perform non-rigid transformation of 3D objects. For those who can perform non-rigid editing, on the other hand, suffer from low-resolution, lack of fidelity and poor flexibility. In order to address these issues, we present: Plasticine3D, a general, high-fidelity, photo-realistic and controllable non-rigid editing pipeline. Firstly, our work divides the editing process into a geometry editing stage and a texture editing stage to achieve more detailed and photo-realistic results ; Secondly, in order to perform non-rigid transformation with controllable results while maintain the fidelity towards original 3D models in the same time, we propose a multi-view-embedding(MVE) optimization strategy to ensure that the diffusion model learns the overall features of the original object and an embedding-fusion(EF) to control the degree of editing by adjusting the value of the fusing rate. We also design a geometry processing step before optimizing on the base geometry to cope with different needs of various editing tasks. Further more, to fully leverage the geometric prior from the original 3D object, we provide an optional replacement of score distillation sampling named score projection sampling(SPS) which enables us to directly perform optimization from the origin 3D mesh in most common median non-rigid editing scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both the non-rigid 3D editing task and general 3D editing task. "

        "abstract": "Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We simultaneously employ a pixel-wise noise modeling network based on Normalizing Flows, and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines on the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network, trained with synthesized image pairs from our model, also shows superior performance compared to other baselines.

However, these methods often inadvertently alter unintended areas and struggle with multi-instruction editing, resulting in compromised outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce the Focus on Your Instruction (FoI), a method designed to ensure precise and harmonious editing across multiple instructions without extra training or test-time optimization. In the FoI, we primarily emphasize two aspects: (1) precisely extracting regions of interest for each instruction and (2) guiding the denoising process to concentrate within these regions of interest. For the first objective, we identify the implicit grounding capability of IP2P from the cross-attention between instruction and image, then develop an effective mask extraction method. For the second objective, we introduce a cross attention modulation module for rough isolation of target editing regions and unrelated regions. Additionally, we introduce a mask-guided disentangle sampling strategy to further ensure clear region isolation. Experimental results demonstrate that FoI surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, especially excelling in multi-instruction editing task. "

        "abstract": "Prior studies on Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) reveal immense potential towards a generic model for Earth Observation. Nevertheless, these works primarily focus on a single modality without temporal and geo-context modeling, hampering their capabilities for diverse tasks. In this study, we present SkySense, a generic billion-scale model, pre-trained on a curated multi-modal Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI) dataset with 21.5 million temporal sequences. SkySense incorporates a factorized multi-modal spatiotemporal encoder taking temporal sequences of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as input. This encoder is pre-trained by our proposed Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning to learn representations across different modal and spatial granularities. To further enhance the RSI representations by the geo-context clue, we introduce Geo-Context Prototype Learning to learn region-aware prototypes upon RSI's multi-modal spatiotemporal features. To our best knowledge, SkySense is the largest Multi-Modal RSFM to date, whose modules can be flexibly combined or used individually to accommodate various tasks. It demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities on a thorough evaluation encompassing 16 datasets over 7 tasks, from single- to multi-modal, static to temporal, and classification to localization. SkySense surpasses 18 recent RSFMs in all test scenarios. Specifically, it outperforms the latest models such as GFM, SatLas and Scale-MAE by a large margin, i.e., 2.76%, 3.67% and 3.61% on average respectively.

Most advances require fine-tuning existing 2D Stable Diffsuions into multi-view settings or tedious distilling operations and hence fall short of 3D human generation due to the lack of diverse 3D human datasets. We present an alternative scheme named MVHuman to generate human radiance fields from text guidance, with consistent multi-view images directly sampled from pre-trained Stable Diffsuions without any fine-tuning or distilling. Our core is a multi-view sampling strategy to tailor the denoising processes of the pre-trained network for generating consistent multi-view images. It encompasses view-consistent conditioning, replacing the original noises with ``consistency-guided noises'', optimizing latent codes, as well as utilizing cross-view attention layers. With the multi-view images through the sampling process, we adopt geometry refinement and 3D radiance field generation followed by a subsequent neural blending scheme for free-view rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method, as well as its superiority to state-of-the-art 3D human generation methods. "

The most powerful models in this space have been trained using massive datasets of paired inputs and large-scale computational resources, making them prohibitively expensive to train in many practical scenarios.

We therefore propose FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders. Using FuseMix for multimodal alignment, we achieve competitive performance -- and in certain cases outperform state-of-the art methods -- in both image-text and audio-text retrieval, with orders of magnitude less compute and data: for example, we outperform CLIP on the Flickr30K text-to-image retrieval task with $\\sim \\! 600\\times$ fewer GPU days and $\\sim \\! 80\\times$ fewer image-text pairs.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have led to significant progress in generating natural language descriptions for visual content and thus enhancing various applications. One issue with these powerful models is that they sometimes produce texts that are factually inconsistent with the visual input. While there has been some effort to mitigate such inconsistencies in natural image captioning, the factuality of generated captions for structured document images, such as charts, has not received as much scrutiny, posing a potential threat to information reliability in critical applications. This work delves into the factuality aspect by introducing a comprehensive typology of factual errors in generated chart captions. A large-scale human annotation effort provides insight into the error patterns and frequencies in captions crafted by various chart captioning models, ultimately forming the foundation of a novel dataset, CHOCOLATE. Our analysis reveals that even state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4V, frequently produce captions laced with factual inaccuracies. In response to this challenge, we establish the new task of Chart Caption Factual Error Correction and introduce CHARTVE, a model for visual entailment that outperforms proprietary and open-source LVLMs in evaluating factual consistency. Furthermore, we propose C2TFEC, an interpretable two-stage framework that excels at correcting factual errors. This work inaugurates a new domain in factual error correction for chart captions, presenting a novel evaluation mechanism, and demonstrating an effective approach to ensuring the factuality of generated chart captions.

Such a model would enable predicting subjective feedback such as overall satisfaction or aesthetic quality ratings, along with the underlying human attention or interaction heatmaps and viewing order, enabling designers and content-creation models to optimize their creation for human-centric improvements. In this paper, we propose UniAR -- a unified model that predicts both implicit and explicit human behavior across different types of visual content. UniAR leverages a multimodal transformer, featuring distinct prediction heads for each facet, and predicts attention heatmap, scanpath or viewing order, and subjective rating/preference. We train UniAR on diverse public datasets spanning natural images, web pages and graphic designs, and achieve leading performance on multiple benchmarks across different image domains and various behavior modeling tasks.

        "abstract": "The computational cost of transformer models makes them inefficient in low-latency or low-power applications. While techniques such as quantization or linear attention can reduce the computational load, they may incur a reduction in accuracy. In addition, globally reducing the cost for all inputs may be sub-optimal. We observe that for each layer, the full width of the layer may be needed only for a small subset of tokens inside a batch and that the \"effective\" width needed to process a token can vary from layer to layer. Motivated by this observation, we introduce the Adaptive Computation Module (ACM), a generic module that dynamically adapts its computational load to match the estimated difficulty of the input on a per-token basis. An ACM consists of a sequence of learners that progressively refine the output of their preceding counterparts. An additional gating mechanism determines the optimal number of learners to execute for each token. We also describe a distillation technique to replace any pre-trained model with an \"ACMized\" variant. The distillation phase is designed to be highly parallelizable across layers while being simple to plug-and-play into existing networks. Our evaluation of transformer models in computer vision and speech recognition demonstrates that substituting layers with ACMs significantly reduces inference costs without degrading the downstream accuracy for a wide interval of user-defined budgets.

For evaluation, we construct zero-shot and few-shot prompts to query the LLMs whether a given sentence contains mobility functioning information. Two sampling techniques, random sampling and k-nearest neighbor (kNN)-based sampling, are used to select the few-shot examples. Furthermore, we apply a parameter-efficient prompt-based fine-tuning method to the LLMs and evaluate their performance under various training settings. Results: Flan-T5-xxl outperforms all other models in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, achieving a F1 score of 0.865 with a single demonstrative example selected by kNN sampling. In prompt-based fine-tuning experiments, this foundation model also demonstrates superior performance across all low-resource settings, particularly achieving an impressive F1 score of 0.922 using the full training dataset. The smaller model, Flan-T5-xl, requires fine-tuning with only 2.3M additional parameters to achieve comparable performance to the fully fine-tuned Gatortron-base model, both surpassing 0.9 F1 score. Conclusion: Open-source instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate impressive in-context learning capability in the mobility functioning classification task. The performance of these models can be further improved by continuing fine-tuning on a task-specific dataset. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10209",
        "abstract": "Humans' internal states play a key role in human-machine interaction, leading to the rise of human state estimation as a prominent field. Compared to swift state changes such as surprise and irritation, modeling gradual states like trust and satisfaction are further challenged by label sparsity: long time-series signals are usually associated with a single label, making it difficult to identify the critical span of state shifts. Windowing has been one widely-used technique to enable localized analysis of long time-series data. However, the performance of downstream models can be sensitive to the window size, and determining the optimal window size demands domain expertise and extensive search. To address this challenge, we propose a Selective Windowing Attention Network (SWAN), which employs window prompts and masked attention transformation to enable the selection of attended intervals with flexible lengths. We evaluate SWAN on the task of trust prediction on a new multimodal driving simulation dataset. Experiments show that SWAN significantly outperforms an existing empirical window selection baseline and neural network baselines including CNN-LSTM and Transformer. Furthermore, it shows robustness across a wide span of windowing ranges, compared to the traditional windowing approach. "

        "abstract": "The scarcity of annotated data in outdoor point cloud segmentation poses a significant obstacle in harnessing the modeling capabilities of advanced networks like transformers. Consequently, scholars have been actively investigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training strategies, e.g. contrasting learning and reconstruction-based pretext tasks. Nevertheless, temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, is consistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose an effective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked AutoEncoders (T-MAE), which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency. A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a window-based cross-attention (WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Taking into account that the motion of an ego-vehicle alters the illumination angles of the same instance, temporal modeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing the comprehension of target objects. Moreover, instead of utilizing consecutive frames, it is more cost-effective and powerful by using distant historical frames. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavily relies on annotated data. With our T-MAE pre-training strategy, we achieve the best performance on the Waymo dataset among self-supervised learning methods. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate all components of our proposal. Upon acceptance, the source code will be made accessible. "

However, many generated images still suffer from issues such as artifacts/implausibility, misalignment with text descriptions, and low aesthetic quality. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for large language models, prior works collected human-provided scores as feedback on generated images and trained a reward model to improve the T2I generation. In this paper, we enrich the feedback signal by (i) marking image regions that are implausible or misaligned with the text, and (ii) annotating which words in the text prompt are misrepresented or missing on the image. We collect such rich human feedback on 18K generated images and train a multimodal transformer to predict the rich feedback automatically. We show that the predicted rich human feedback can be leveraged to improve image generation, for example, by selecting high-quality training data to finetune and improve the generative models, or by creating masks with predicted heatmaps to inpaint the problematic regions. Notably, the improvements generalize to models (Muse) beyond those used to generate the images on which human feedback data were collected (Stable Diffusion variants). "

In this work, we propose finetuning the vision encoder of a CLIP model in a way that its embeddings can be easily used for nearest neighbor based classification, while also getting accuracy close to or exceeding full finetuning. A nearest neighbor based classifier needs no incremental training for new products, thus saving resources and wait time. "

Automatically interpreting figurative language is a challenging task, even with modern Large Language Models (LLMs), as it often involves subtle nuances. This is particularly true in the SE domain, where figurative language is frequently used to convey technical concepts, often bearing developer affect (e.g., `spaghetti code'). Surprisingly, there is a lack of studies on how figurative language in SE communications impacts the performance of automatic tools that focus on understanding developer communications, e.g., bug prioritization, incivility detection. Furthermore, it is an open question to what extent state-of-the-art LLMs interpret figurative expressions in domain-specific communication such as software engineering. To address this gap, we study the prevalence and impact of figurative language in SE communication channels. This study contributes to understanding the role of figurative language in SE, the potential of LLMs in interpreting them, and its impact on automated SE communication analysis. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs with figurative language in SE and its potential impact on automated tasks that involve affect. We found that, among three state-of-the-art LLMs, the best improved fine-tuned versions have an average improvement of 6.66% on a GitHub emotion classification dataset, 7.07% on a GitHub incivility classification dataset, and 3.71% on a Bugzilla bug report prioritization dataset.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models possess powerful generative capabilities enabling the mapping of noise to data using reverse stochastic differential equations. However, in image restoration tasks, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality images to high-quality images. To address this, we introduced the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized OU process and further adjusting the variance of its steady-state distribution through the Doob's h-transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point to point with minimal cost. This allows for end-to-end training, enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Additionally, we uncovered the mathematical essence of some bridge models, all of which are special cases of the GOUB and empirically demonstrated the optimality of our proposed models. Furthermore, benefiting from our distinctive parameterization mechanism, we proposed the Mean-ODE model that is better at capturing pixel-level information and structural perceptions. Experimental results show that both models achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution.

To address this challenge, we introduce Nuggets, a novel and efficient methodology that employs one shot learning to select high-quality instruction data from expansive datasets. Nuggets assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to act as effective one shot examples, thereby identifying those that can significantly enhance diverse task performance. Nuggets utilizes a scoring system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse anchor set, facilitating the selection of the most beneficial data for instruction tuning. Through rigorous testing on two benchmarks, including MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, we demonstrate that instruction tuning with the top 1% of Nuggets-curated examples substantially outperforms conventional methods that use the full dataset. These findings advocate for a data selection paradigm that prioritizes quality, offering a more efficient pathway to align LLMs with humans. "

Our approach tackles this issue through a two-phase process, utilizing a reference speech encoding network and a global information disentanglement network to gradually disentangle the speaker identity information from other irrelevant factors. We exclusively employ the disentangled speaker identity information to guide the speech extraction network. Moreover, we introduce the adaptive modulation Transformer to ensure that the acoustic representation of the mixed signal remains undisturbed by the speaker embeddings. This component incorporates speaker embeddings as conditional information, facilitating natural and efficient guidance for the speech extraction network. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our meticulously crafted approach, showcasing a substantial reduction in the likelihood of speaker confusion. "

        "abstract": "Generating music with emotion is an important task in automatic music generation, in which emotion is evoked through a variety of musical elements (such as pitch and duration) that change over time and collaborate with each other. However, prior research on deep learning-based emotional music generation has rarely explored the contribution of different musical elements to emotions, let alone the deliberate manipulation of these elements to alter the emotion of music, which is not conducive to fine-grained element-level control over emotions. To address this gap, we present a novel approach employing musical element-based regularization in the latent space to disentangle distinct elements, investigate their roles in distinguishing emotions, and further manipulate elements to alter musical emotions. Specifically, we propose a novel VQ-VAE-based model named MusER. MusER incorporates a regularization loss to enforce the correspondence between the musical element sequences and the specific dimensions of latent variable sequences, providing a new solution for disentangling discrete sequences. Taking advantage of the disentangled latent vectors, a two-level decoding strategy that includes multiple decoders attending to latent vectors with different semantics is devised to better predict the elements. By visualizing latent space, we conclude that MusER yields a disentangled and interpretable latent space and gain insights into the contribution of distinct elements to the emotional dimensions (i.e., arousal and valence). Experimental results demonstrate that MusER outperforms the state-of-the-art models for generating emotional music in both objective and subjective evaluation. Besides, we rearrange music through element transfer and attempt to alter the emotion of music by transferring emotion-distinguishable elements. "

While the research community has reasoned about SQL equivalence for decades, it poses considerable difficulties and no complete solutions exist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capability in conversation, question answering and solving mathematics challenges. In this paper, we study if LLMs can be used to determine the equivalence between SQL queries under two notions of SQL equivalence (semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence). To assist LLMs in generating high quality responses, we present two prompting techniques: Miniature & Mull and Explain & Compare. The former technique is used to evaluate the semantic equivalence in which it asks LLMs to execute a query on a simple database instance and then explore if a counterexample exists by modifying the database. The latter technique is used to evaluate the relaxed equivalence in which it asks LLMs to explain the queries and then compare if they contain significant logical differences. Our experiments demonstrate using our techniques, LLMs is a promising tool to help data engineers in writing semantically equivalent SQL queries, however challenges still persist, and is a better metric for evaluating SQL generation than the popular execution accuracy.

We present pioneering investigations that reveal the low-pass filtering nature of self-attention in the SR, which causes oversmoothing. To this end, we propose a novel method called Beyond Self-Attention for Sequential Recommendation (BSARec), which leverages the Fourier transform to i) inject an inductive bias by considering fine-grained sequential patterns and ii) integrate low and high-frequency information to mitigate oversmoothing. Our discovery shows significant advancements in the SR domain and is expected to bridge the gap for existing Transformer-based SR models.

We focus on fast algorithms of nonlinear discrete system for the general PNP equations, which have better adaptability, friendliness and efficiency than the Gummel iteration. First, a geometric full approximation storage (FAS) algorithm is proposed to improve the slow convergence speed of the Gummel iteration. Second, an algebraic FAS algorithm is designed, which does not require multi-level geometric information and is more suitable for practical computation compared with the geometric one. Finally, improved algorithms based on the acceleration technique and adaptive method are proposed to solve the problems of excessive coarse grid iterations and insufficient adaptability to the size of computational domain in the algebraic FAS algorithm.

However, the conventional sequential execution mode of DNN operators in mainstream DL frameworks cannot fully utilize GPU resources, due to the increasing complexity of DNN model structures and the progressively smaller computational sizes of DNN operators. Moreover, the inadequate operator launch order in parallelized execution scenarios can lead to GPU resource wastage and unexpected performance interference among operators. To address such performance issues above, we propose Opara, a resource- and interference-aware DNN Operator parallel scheduling framework to accelerate the execution of DNN inference on GPUs. Specifically, Opara first employs CUDA Streams and CUDA Graph to automatically parallelize the execution of multiple DNN operators. It further leverages the resource demands of DNN operators to judiciously adjust the operator launch order on GPUs by overlapping the execution of compute-intensive and memory-intensive operators, so as to expedite DNN inference. We implement and open source a prototype of Opara based on PyTorch in a non-intrusive manner. Extensive prototype experiments with representative DNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that Opara outperforms the default sequential CUDA Graph in PyTorch and the state-of-the-art DNN operator parallelism systems by up to 1.68$\\times$ and 1.29$\\times$, respectively, yet with acceptable runtime overhead.

Large language models (LLMs) achieve superior performance on various NLG evaluation tasks. However, current work often employs the LLM to independently evaluate different aspects, which largely ignores the rich correlation between various aspects. To fill this research gap, in this work, we propose an NLG evaluation metric called CoAScore. Powered by LLMs, the CoAScore utilizes multi-aspect knowledge through a CoA (\\textbf{C}hain-\\textbf{o}f-\\textbf{A}spects) prompting framework when assessing the quality of a certain aspect. Specifically, for a given aspect to evaluate, we first prompt the LLM to generate a chain of aspects that are relevant to the target aspect and could be useful for the evaluation. We then collect evaluation scores for each generated aspect, and finally, leverage the knowledge of these aspects to improve the evaluation of the target aspect. We evaluate CoAScore across five NLG evaluation tasks (e.g., summarization, dialog response generation, etc) and nine aspects (e.g., overall quality, relevance, coherence, etc). Our experimental findings highlight that, in comparison to individual aspect evaluation, CoAScore exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments. This improvement significantly outperforms existing unsupervised evaluation metrics, whether for assessing overall quality or other aspects. We also conducted extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the three stages within the CoAScore framework and conducted case studies to show how the LLM performs in these stages.

However, Transformer fine-tuning has long running time and high memory consumption due to the large size of the models. We propose the SPT system to fine-tune Transformer-based models efficiently by introducing sparsity. We observe that the memory consumption of Transformer mainly comes from storing attention weights for multi-head attention (MHA), and the majority of running time is spent on feed-forward network (FFN). Thus, we design the sparse MHA module, which computes and stores only large attention weights to reduce memory consumption, and the routed FFN module, which dynamically activates a subset of model parameters for each token to reduce computation cost. We implement SPT on PyTorch and customize CUDA kernels to run sparse MHA and routed FFN efficiently. Specifically, we use product quantization to identify the large attention weights and compute attention via sparse matrix multiplication for sparse MHA. For routed FFN, we batch the tokens according to their activated model parameters for efficient computation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SPT on various model configurations. The results show that SPT consistently outperforms well-optimized baselines, reducing the peak memory consumption by up to 50% and accelerating fine-tuning by up to 2.2x. "

PWS uses various weak supervision techniques to estimate the underlying class labels of data, while generative models primarily concentrate on sampling from the underlying distribution of the given dataset. Although these methods have the potential to complement each other, they have mostly been studied independently. Recently, WSGAN proposed a mechanism to fuse these two models. Their approach utilizes the discrete latent factors of InfoGAN to train the label model and leverages the class-dependent information of the label model to generate images of specific classes. However, the disentangled latent factors learned by InfoGAN might not necessarily be class-specific and could potentially affect the label model's accuracy. Moreover, prediction made by the label model is often noisy in nature and can have a detrimental impact on the quality of images generated by GAN. In our work, we address these challenges by (i) implementing a noise-aware classifier using the pseudo labels generated by the label model (ii) utilizing the noise-aware classifier's prediction to train the label model and generate class-conditional images. Additionally, we also investigate the effect of training the classifier with a subset of the dataset within a defined uncertainty budget on pseudo labels. We accomplish this by formalizing the subset selection problem as a submodular maximization objective with a knapsack constraint on the entropy of pseudo labels.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10380",
        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing attention since it allows for privacy-preserving collaborative training on decentralized clients without explicitly uploading sensitive data to the central server. However, recent works have revealed that it still has the risk of exposing private data to adversaries. In this paper, we conduct reconstruction attacks and enhance inference attacks on various datasets to better understand that sharing trained classification model parameters to a central server is the main problem of privacy leakage in FL. To tackle this problem, a privacy-preserving image distribution sharing scheme with GAN (PPIDSG) is proposed, which consists of a block scrambling-based encryption algorithm, an image distribution sharing method, and local classification training. Specifically, our method can capture the distribution of a target image domain which is transformed by the block encryption algorithm, and upload generator parameters to avoid classifier sharing with negligible influence on model performance. Furthermore, we apply a feature extractor to motivate model utility and train it separately from the classifier. The extensive experimental results and security analyses demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme compared to other state-of-the-art defense methods.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models are loosely modelled based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where \\textit{diffusion} refers to particles flowing from high-concentration regions towards low-concentration regions. In statistics, the meaning is quite similar, namely the process of transforming a complex distribution $p_{\\text{complex}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to a simple distribution $p_{\\text{prior}}$ on the same domain. This constitutes a Markov chain of diffusion steps of slowly adding random noise to data, followed by a reverse diffusion process in which the data is reconstructed from the noise. The diffusion model learns the data manifold to which the original and thus the reconstructed data samples belong, by training on a large number of data points. While the diffusion process pushes a data sample off the data manifold, the reverse process finds a trajectory back to the data manifold. Diffusion models have -- unlike variational autoencoder and flow models -- latent variables with the same dimensionality as the original data, and they are currently\\footnote{At the time of writing, 2023.} outperforming other approaches -- including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- to modelling the distribution of, e.g., natural images.

        "abstract": "Deformable object manipulation (DOM) for robots has a wide range of applications in various fields such as industrial, service and health care sectors. However, compared to manipulation of rigid objects, DOM poses significant challenges for robotic perception, modeling and manipulation, due to the infinite dimensionality of the state space of deformable objects (DOs) and the complexity of their dynamics. The development of computer graphics and machine learning has enabled novel techniques for DOM. These techniques, based on data-driven paradigms, can address some of the challenges that analytical approaches of DOM face. However, some existing reviews do not include all aspects of DOM, and some previous reviews do not summarize data-driven approaches adequately. In this article, we survey more than 150 relevant studies (data-driven approaches mainly) and summarize recent advances, open challenges, and new frontiers for aspects of perception, modeling and manipulation for DOs. Particularly, we summarize initial progress made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic manipulation, and indicates some valuable directions for further research. We believe that integrating data-driven approaches and analytical approaches can provide viable solutions to open challenges of DOM. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10422",
        "abstract": "Face reenactment is challenging due to the need to establish dense correspondence between various face representations for motion transfer. Recent studies have utilized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as fundamental representation, which further enhanced the performance of multi-view face reenactment in photo-realism and 3D consistency. However, establishing dense correspondence between different face NeRFs is non-trivial, because implicit representations lack ground-truth correspondence annotations like mesh-based 3D parametric models (e.g., 3DMM) with index-aligned vertexes. Although aligning 3DMM space with NeRF-based face representations can realize motion control, it is sub-optimal for their limited face-only modeling and low identity fidelity. Therefore, we are inspired to ask: Can we learn the dense correspondence between different NeRF-based face representations without a 3D parametric model prior? To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, which adopts tri-planes as fundamental NeRF representation and decomposes face tri-planes into three components: canonical tri-planes, identity deformations, and motion. In terms of motion control, our key contribution is proposing a Plane Dictionary (PlaneDict) module, which efficiently maps the motion conditions to a linear weighted addition of learnable orthogonal plane bases. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first method that achieves one-shot multi-view face reenactment without a 3D parametric model prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we produce better results in fine-grained motion control and identity preservation than previous methods. "

However, the consideration of mixed-type tabular data with this model family has fallen short so far. Existing research mainly combines different diffusion processes without explicitly accounting for the feature heterogeneity inherent to tabular data. In this paper, we combine score matching and score interpolation to ensure a common type of continuous noise distribution that affects both continuous and categorical features alike. Further, we investigate the impact of distinct noise schedules per feature or per data type. We allow for adaptive, learnable noise schedules to ensure optimally allocated model capacity and balanced generative capability. Results show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models and that accounting for heterogeneity within the noise schedule design boosts the sample quality. "

        "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to detect novel objects beyond a given set of base categories on which the detection model is trained. Recent OVOD methods focus on adapting the image-level pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to a region-level object detection task via, eg., region-level knowledge distillation, regional prompt learning, or region-text pre-training, to expand the detection vocabulary. These methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in recognizing regional visual concepts, but they are weak in exploiting the VLMs' powerful global scene understanding ability learned from the billion-scale image-level text descriptions. This limits their capability in detecting hard objects of small, blurred, or occluded appearance from novel/base categories, whose detection heavily relies on contextual information. To address this, we propose a novel approach, namely Simple Image-level Classification for Context-Aware Detection Scoring (SIC-CADS), to leverage the superior global knowledge yielded from CLIP for complementing the current OVOD models from a global perspective. The core of SIC-CADS is a multi-modal multi-label recognition (MLR) module that learns the object co-occurrence-based contextual information from CLIP to recognize all possible object categories in the scene. These image-level MLR scores can then be utilized to refine the instance-level detection scores of the current OVOD models in detecting those hard objects. This is verified by extensive empirical results on two popular benchmarks, OV-LVIS and OV-COCO, which show that SIC-CADS achieves significant and consistent improvement when combined with different types of OVOD models. Further, SIC-CADS also improves the cross-dataset generalization ability on Objects365 and OpenImages. The code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/SIC-CADS. "

        "abstract": "Crash bugs cause unexpected program behaviors or even termination, requiring high-priority resolution. However, manually resolving crash bugs is challenging and labor-intensive, and researchers have proposed various techniques for their automated localization and repair. ChatGPT, a recent large language model (LLM), has garnered significant attention due to its exceptional performance across various domains. This work performs the first investigation into ChatGPT's capability in resolve real-world crash bugs, focusing on its effectiveness in both localizing and repairing code-related and environment-related crash bugs. Specifically, we initially assess ChatGPT's fundamental ability to resolve crash bugs with basic prompts in a single iteration. We observe that ChatGPT performs better at resolving code-related crash bugs compared to environment-related ones, and its primary challenge in resolution lies in inaccurate localization. Additionally, we explore ChatGPT's potential with various advanced prompts. Furthermore, by stimulating ChatGPT's self-planning, it methodically investigates each potential crash-causing environmental factor through proactive inquiry, ultimately identifying the root cause of the crash. Based on our findings, we propose IntDiagSolver, an interaction methodology designed to facilitate precise crash bug resolution through continuous interaction with LLMs. Evaluating IntDiagSolver on multiple LLMs reveals consistent enhancement in the accuracy of crash bug resolution, including ChatGPT, Claude, and CodeLlama.

        "abstract": "The development of autoregressive modeling (AM) in computer vision lags behind natural language processing (NLP) in self-supervised pre-training. This is mainly caused by the challenge that images are not sequential signals and lack a natural order when applying autoregressive modeling. In this study, inspired by human beings' way of grasping an image, i.e., focusing on the main object first, we present a semantic-aware autoregressive image modeling (SemAIM) method to tackle this challenge. The key insight of SemAIM is to autoregressive model images from the semantic patches to the less semantic patches. To this end, we first calculate a semantic-aware permutation of patches according to their feature similarities and then perform the autoregression procedure based on the permutation. In addition, considering that the raw pixels of patches are low-level signals and are not ideal prediction targets for learning high-level semantic representation, we also explore utilizing the patch features as the prediction targets. Extensive experiments are conducted on a broad range of downstream tasks, including image classification, object detection, and instance/semantic segmentation, to evaluate the performance of SemAIM. The results demonstrate SemAIM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other self-supervised methods. Specifically, with ViT-B, SemAIM achieves 84.1% top-1 accuracy for fine-tuning on ImageNet, 51.3% AP and 45.4% AP for object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, which outperforms the vanilla MAE by 0.5%, 1.0%, and 0.5%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Recently, the proliferation of highly realistic synthetic images, facilitated through a variety of GANs and Diffusions, has significantly heightened the susceptibility to misuse. While the primary focus of deepfake detection has traditionally centered on the design of detection algorithms, an investigative inquiry into the generator architectures has remained conspicuously absent in recent years. This paper contributes to this lacuna by rethinking the architectures of CNN-based generators, thereby establishing a generalized representation of synthetic artifacts. Our findings illuminate that the up-sampling operator can, beyond frequency-based artifacts, produce generalized forgery artifacts. In particular, the local interdependence among image pixels caused by upsampling operators is significantly demonstrated in synthetic images generated by GAN or diffusion. Building upon this observation, we introduce the concept of Neighboring Pixel Relationships(NPR) as a means to capture and characterize the generalized structural artifacts stemming from up-sampling operations. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on an open-world dataset, comprising samples generated by \\tft{28 distinct generative models}. This analysis culminates in the establishment of a novel state-of-the-art performance, showcasing a remarkable \\tft{12.8\\%} improvement over existing methods.

        "abstract": "Automatic mainstream hashtag recommendation aims to accurately provide users with concise and popular topical hashtags before publication. Generally, mainstream hashtag recommendation faces challenges in the comprehensive difficulty of newly posted tweets in response to new topics, and the accurate identification of mainstream hashtags beyond semantic correctness. However, previous retrieval-based methods based on a fixed predefined mainstream hashtag list excel in producing mainstream hashtags, but fail to understand the constant flow of up-to-date information. Conversely, generation-based methods demonstrate a superior ability to comprehend newly posted tweets, but their capacity is constrained to identifying mainstream hashtags without additional features. Inspired by the recent success of the retrieval-augmented technique, in this work, we attempt to adopt this framework to combine the advantages of both approaches. Meantime, with the help of the generator component, we could rethink how to further improve the quality of the retriever component at a low cost. Therefore, we propose RetrIeval-augmented Generative Mainstream HashTag Recommender (RIGHT), which consists of three components: 1) a retriever seeks relevant hashtags from the entire tweet-hashtags set; 2) a selector enhances mainstream identification by introducing global signals; and 3) a generator incorporates input tweets and selected hashtags to directly generate the desired hashtags. The experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, RIGHT can be easily integrated into large language models, improving the performance of ChatGPT by more than 10%. "

        "abstract": "Few-shot text classification has attracted great interest in both academia and industry due to the lack of labeled data in many fields. Different from general text classification (e.g., topic classification), few-shot sentiment classification is more challenging because the semantic distances among the classes are more subtle. For instance, the semantic distances between the sentiment labels in a positive or negative polarity (e.g., ``love\" and ``joy\", ``remorse\" and ``sadness\") are close, while the distances are large for the sentiment labels in two opposite polarities (e.g., ``love\" and ``sadness\"). To address this problem, we propose a Soft Contrastive learning-based Prompt (\\texttt{SCP}) model for few-shot sentiment analysis. First, we design a sentiment-aware chain of thought prompt module to guide the model to predict the sentiment from coarse grain to fine grain via a series of intermediate reasoning steps. Then, we propose a soft contrastive learning algorithm to take the correlation of the labels into account. A series of experiments on several sentiment analysis datasets show the great advantages of \\texttt{SCP} by comparing it with SOTA baselines (e.g., ChatGPT). "

Testing whether ChatGPT can cause jailbreak is crucial because it can enhance ChatGPT's security, reliability, and social responsibility. Inspired by previous research revealing the varied performance of LLMs in different language translations, we suspected that wrapping prompts in multiple languages might lead to ChatGPT jailbreak. To investigate this, we designed a study with a fuzzing testing approach to analyzing ChatGPT's cross-linguistic proficiency. Our study includes three strategies by automatically posing different formats of malicious questions to ChatGPT: (1) each malicious question involving only one language, (2) multilingual malicious questions, (3) specifying that ChatGPT responds in a language different from the prompts. In addition, we also combine our strategies by utilizing prompt injection templates to wrap the three aforementioned types of questions. We examined a total of 7,892 Q&A data points, discovering that multilingual wrapping can indeed lead to ChatGPT's jailbreak, with different wrapping methods having varying effects on jailbreak probability. Prompt injection can amplify the probability of jailbreak caused by multilingual wrapping.

However, deep fake datasets have not kept up with generative AI advancements sufficiently to enable the development of deep fake detection technology which can meaningfully alert human users in real-world settings. Existing datasets typically use GAN-based models and introduce spurious correlations by always editing similar face regions. To counteract the shortcomings, we introduce DETER, a large-scale dataset for DETEcting edited image Regions and deterring modern advanced generative manipulations. DETER includes 300,000 images manipulated by four state-of-the-art generators with three editing operations: face swapping (a standard coarse image manipulation), inpainting (a novel manipulation for deep fake datasets), and attribute editing (a subtle fine-grained manipulation). While face swapping and attribute editing are performed on similar face regions such as eyes and nose, the inpainting operation can be performed on random image regions, removing the spurious correlations of previous datasets. Careful image post-processing is performed to ensure deep fakes in DETER look realistic, and human studies confirm that human deep fake detection rate on DETER is 20.4% lower than on other fake datasets.

Based upon the Krylov subspace iterative methods, fast matrix-vector multiplications of the resulting coefficient matrices with any vector are developed, in which they can be implemented in only $\\mathcal{O}(MN_{exp})$ operations per iteration, where $N_{exp}\\ll M$ is the number of exponentials in the SOE approximation.

The MDER aims to identify the emotional information contained in different modalities, e.g., text, video, and audio, in different dialogue scenes. However, existing research has focused on modeling contextual semantic information and dialogue relations between speakers while ignoring the impact of event relations on emotion. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Dialogue and Event Relation-Aware Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DER-GCN) method. It models dialogue relations between speakers and captures latent event relations information. Specifically, we construct a weighted multi-relationship graph to simultaneously capture the dependencies between speakers and event relations in a dialogue. Moreover, we also introduce a Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoder (SMGAE) to improve the fusion representation ability of features and structures. Next, we design a new Multiple Information Transformer (MIT) to capture the correlation between different relations, which can provide a better fuse of the multivariate information between relations. Finally, we propose a loss optimization strategy based on contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning ability of minority class features. We conduct extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of the DER-GCN model.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10610",
        "abstract": "A number of tasks have been proposed recently to facilitate easy access to charts such as chart QA and summarization. The dominant paradigm to solve these tasks has been to fine-tune a pretrained model on the task data. However, this approach is not only expensive but also not generalizable to unseen tasks. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive generalization capabilities to unseen tasks with zero- or few-shot prompting. However, their application to chart-related tasks is not trivial as these tasks typically involve considering not only the underlying data but also the visual features in the chart image. We propose PromptChart, a multimodal few-shot prompting framework with LLMs for chart-related applications. By analyzing the tasks carefully, we have come up with a set of prompting guidelines for each task to elicit the best few-shot performance from LLMs. We further propose a strategy to inject visual information into the prompts. Our experiments on three different chart-related information consumption tasks show that with properly designed prompts LLMs can excel on the benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art. "

        "abstract": "Due to the rapid development of computer vision, single-modal (RGB) object tracking has made significant progress in recent years. Considering the limitation of single imaging sensor, multi-modal images (RGB, Infrared, etc.) are introduced to compensate for this deficiency for all-weather object tracking in complex environments. However, as acquiring sufficient multi-modal tracking data is hard while the dominant modality changes with the open environment, most existing techniques fail to extract multi-modal complementary information dynamically, yielding unsatisfactory tracking performance. To handle this problem, we propose a novel multi-modal visual prompt tracking model based on a universal bi-directional adapter, cross-prompting multiple modalities mutually. Our model consists of a universal bi-directional adapter and multiple modality-specific transformer encoder branches with sharing parameters. The encoders extract features of each modality separately by using a frozen pre-trained foundation model. We develop a simple but effective light feature adapter to transfer modality-specific information from one modality to another, performing visual feature prompt fusion in an adaptive manner. With adding fewer (0.32M) trainable parameters, our model achieves superior tracking performance in comparison with both the full fine-tuning methods and the prompt learning-based methods.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a novel avenue for unit test script generation. This research aims to experimentally investigate the effectiveness of LLMs, specifically exemplified by ChatGPT, for generating unit test scripts for Python programs, and how the generated test cases compare with those generated by an existing unit test generator (Pynguin). For experiments, we consider three types of code units: 1) Procedural scripts, 2) Function-based modular code, and 3) Class-based code. The generated test cases are evaluated based on criteria such as coverage, correctness, and readability. Our results show that ChatGPT's performance is comparable with Pynguin in terms of coverage. At the same time, ChatGPT's ability to generate tests is superior to Pynguin, as the latter is not able to generate test cases for Category 1. We also find that about 39% and 28% of assertions generated by ChatGPT for Category 2 and 3, respectively, were incorrect. Our results also show that there is minimal overlap in missed statements between ChatGPT and Pynguin, thus, suggesting that a combination of both tools may enhance unit test generation performance. Finally, prompt engineering improved ChatGPT's performance, achieving an average 28% coverage improvement in Category 2 and 15% improvement in Category 3 after about 4 iterations. "

        "abstract": "In this study, we introduce T2M-HiFiGPT, a novel conditional generative framework for synthesizing human motion from textual descriptions. This framework is underpinned by a Residual Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a double-tier Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) architecture. We demonstrate that our CNN-based RVQ-VAE is capable of producing highly accurate 2D temporal-residual discrete motion representations. Our proposed double-tier GPT structure comprises a temporal GPT and a residual GPT. The temporal GPT efficiently condenses information from previous frames and textual descriptions into a 1D context vector. This vector then serves as a context prompt for the residual GPT, which generates the final residual discrete indices. These indices are subsequently transformed back into motion data by the RVQ-VAE decoder. To mitigate the exposure bias issue, we employ straightforward code corruption techniques for RVQ and a conditional dropout strategy, resulting in enhanced synthesis performance. Remarkably, T2M-HiFiGPT not only simplifies the generative process but also surpasses existing methods in both performance and parameter efficacy, including the latest diffusion-based and GPT-based models. On the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, our framework achieves exceptional results across nearly all primary metrics. We further validate the efficacy of our framework through comprehensive ablation studies on the HumanML3D dataset, examining the contribution of each component. Our findings reveal that RVQ-VAE is more adept at capturing precise 3D human motion with comparable computational demand compared to its VQ-VAE counterparts. As a result, T2M-HiFiGPT enables the generation of human motion with significantly increased accuracy, outperforming recent state-of-the-art approaches such as T2M-GPT and Att-T2M. "

        "abstract": "Beyond 5G networks provide solutions for next-generation communications, especially digital twins networks (DTNs) have gained increasing popularity for bridging physical space and digital space. However, current DTNs networking frameworks pose a number of challenges especially when applied in scenarios that require high communication efficiency and multimodal data processing. First, current DTNs frameworks are unavoidable regarding high resource consumption and communication congestion because of original bit-level communication and high-frequency computation, especially distributed learning-based DTNs. Second, current machine learning models for DTNs are domain-specific (e.g. E-health), making it difficult to handle DT scenarios with multimodal data processing requirements. Last but not least, current security schemes for DTNs, such as blockchain, introduce additional overheads that impair the efficiency of DTNs. To address the above challenges, we propose a large language model (LLM) empowered DTNs networking framework, LLM-Twin. First, we design the mini-giant model collaboration scheme to achieve efficient deployment of LLM in DTNs, since LLM are naturally conducive to processing multimodal data. Then, we design a semantic-level high-efficiency, and secure communication model for DTNs. The feasibility of LLM-Twin is demonstrated by numerical experiments and case studies. To our knowledge, this is the first to propose LLM-based semantic-level digital twin networking framework. "

However, the existing methods mostly utilize NeRFs for data augmentation to improve the regression model training, and the performance on novel viewpoints and appearances is still limited due to the lack of geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel visual localization framework, \\ie, PNeRFLoc, based on a unified point-based representation. On the one hand, PNeRFLoc supports the initial pose estimation by matching 2D and 3D feature points as traditional structure-based methods; on the other hand, it also enables pose refinement with novel view synthesis using rendering-based optimization. Specifically, we propose a novel feature adaption module to close the gaps between the features for visual localization and neural rendering. To improve the efficacy and efficiency of neural rendering-based optimization, we also develop an efficient rendering-based framework with a warping loss function. Furthermore, several robustness techniques are developed to handle illumination changes and dynamic objects for outdoor scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that PNeRFLoc performs the best on synthetic data when the NeRF model can be well learned and performs on par with the SOTA method on the visual localization benchmark datasets.

Zero-shot video editing offers a solution by utilizing pre-trained image diffusion models to translate source videos into new ones.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos by merging self-attention tokens across frames. By aligning and compressing temporally redundant tokens across frames, our method improves temporal coherence and reduces memory consumption in self-attention computations. The merging strategy matches and aligns tokens according to the temporal correspondence between frames, facilitating natural temporal consistency in generated video frames. To manage the complexity of video processing, we divide videos into chunks and develop intra-chunk local token merging and inter-chunk global token merging, ensuring both short-term video continuity and long-term content consistency. Our video editing approach seamlessly extends the advancements in image editing to video editing, rendering favorable results in temporal consistency over state-of-the-art methods. "

In this paper, we formulate PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and fully exploit the relations between pedestrian images and attribute labels. Specifically, the attribute phrases are first expanded into sentences, and then the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP is adopted as our backbone for feature embedding of visual images and attribute descriptions. The contrastive learning objective connects the vision and language modalities well in the CLIP-based feature space, and the Transformer layers used in CLIP can capture the long-range relations between pixels. Then, a multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the dual features effectively and feed-forward network is used to predict attributes. To optimize our network efficiently, we propose the region-aware prompt tuning technique to adjust very few parameters (i.e., only the prompt vectors and classification heads) and fix both the pre-trained VL model and multi-modal Transformer. Our proposed PAR algorithm only adjusts 0.75% learnable parameters compared with the fine-tuning strategy.

        "abstract": "Learning 3D representation plays a critical role in masked autoencoder (MAE) based pre-training methods for point cloud, including single-modal and cross-modal based MAE. Specifically, although cross-modal MAE methods learn strong 3D representations via the auxiliary of other modal knowledge, they often suffer from heavy computational burdens and heavily rely on massive cross-modal data pairs that are often unavailable, which hinders their applications in practice. Instead, single-modal methods with solely point clouds as input are preferred in real applications due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, such methods easily suffer from limited 3D representations with global random mask input. To learn compact 3D representations, we propose a simple yet effective Point Feature Enhancement Masked Autoencoders (Point-FEMAE), which mainly consists of a global branch and a local branch to capture latent semantic features. Specifically, to learn more compact features, a share-parameter Transformer encoder is introduced to extract point features from the global and local unmasked patches obtained by global random and local block mask strategies, followed by a specific decoder to reconstruct. Meanwhile, to further enhance features in the local branch, we propose a Local Enhancement Module with local patch convolution to perceive fine-grained local context at larger scales. Our method significantly improves the pre-training efficiency compared to cross-modal alternatives, and extensive downstream experiments underscore the state-of-the-art effectiveness, particularly outperforming our baseline (Point-MAE) by 5.16%, 5.00%, and 5.04% in three variants of ScanObjectNN, respectively.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10730",
        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in recent NLP tasks, their deployment poses substantial challenges due to high computational and memory demands. Recent research has concentrated on improving open-source smaller models through knowledge distillation from LLMs to reduce computational resource costs with promising outcomes. Nevertheless, they frequently fall short of attaining LLM-level performance, particularly in tasks demanding advanced reasoning. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Mixed Distillation} framework, which capitalizes on the strengths of Program-of-Thought (PoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities within LLMs and distills these capabilities to smaller models. Regarding these two capabilities, the PoT is dedicated to enhancing the performance of reasoning results generated by smaller models, while CoT simultaneously optimizes the results. Our Mixed Distillation framework offers a promising approach to enhance the capabilities of smaller models, bridging the gap with LLMs, and demonstrating better performance across various tasks. Specifically, on the SVAMP dataset, employing a 7 billion parameter Llama2 and CodeLlama in a mixed distillation framework not only boosts distillation capabilities beyond single-path distillation methods but also outperforms the LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) in terms of reasoning accuracy. Through sampling in multiple-path reasoning, the models achieve impressive accuracy performances of 85% and 85.5%, respectively, signifying advancements over previous distillation methods. "

        "title": "A Unified Framework for Multi-Domain CTR Prediction via Large Language  Models",
        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10743",
        "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them. Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``). In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency. "

        "abstract": "To understand how well a large language model captures certain semantic or syntactic features, researchers typically apply probing classifiers. However, the accuracy of these classifiers is critical for the correct interpretation of the results. If a probing classifier exhibits low accuracy, this may be due either to the fact that the language model does not capture the property under investigation, or to shortcomings in the classifier itself, which is unable to adequately capture the characteristics encoded in the internal representations of the model. Consequently, for more effective diagnosis, it is necessary to use the most accurate classifiers possible for a particular type of task. Logistic regression on the output representation of the transformer neural network layer is most often used to probing the syntactic properties of the language model. "

        "abstract": "In modern machine learning, the trend of harnessing self-supervised learning to derive high-quality representations without label dependency has garnered significant attention. However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations. Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR). Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space. Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation. Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space. This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks. For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10. Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning. This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. "

        "abstract": "The growing popularity of neural machine translation (NMT) and LLMs represented by ChatGPT underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their distinct characteristics and relationships. Such understanding is crucial for language professionals and researchers to make informed decisions and tactful use of these cutting-edge translation technology, but remains underexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) the distinguishability of ChatGPT-generated translations from NMT and human translation (HT), (2) the linguistic characteristics of each translation type, and (3) the degree of resemblance between ChatGPT-produced translations and HT or NMT. To achieve these objectives, we employ statistical testing, machine learning algorithms, and multidimensional analysis (MDA) to analyze Spokesperson's Remarks and their translations. After extracting a wide range of linguistic features, supervised classifiers demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing the three translation types, whereas unsupervised clustering techniques do not yield satisfactory results. Another major finding is that ChatGPT-produced translations exhibit greater similarity with NMT than HT in most MDA dimensions, which is further corroborated by distance computing and visualization. These novel insights shed light on the interrelationships among the three translation types and have implications for the future advancements of NMT and generative AI. "

        "abstract": "High-resolution representation is essential for achieving good performance in human pose estimation models. To obtain such features, existing works utilize high-resolution input images or fine-grained image tokens. However, this dense high-resolution representation brings a significant computational burden. In this paper, we address the following question: \"Only sparse human keypoint locations are detected for human pose estimation, is it really necessary to describe the whole image in a dense, high-resolution manner?\" Based on dynamic transformer models, we propose a framework that only uses Sparse High-resolution Representations for human Pose estimation (SHaRPose). In detail, SHaRPose consists of two stages. At the coarse stage, the relations between image regions and keypoints are dynamically mined while a coarse estimation is generated. Then, a quality predictor is applied to decide whether the coarse estimation results should be refined. At the fine stage, SHaRPose builds sparse high-resolution representations only on the regions related to the keypoints and provides refined high-precision human pose estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art method ViTPose, our model SHaRPose-Base achieves 77.4 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO validation set and 76.7 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO test-dev set, and infers at a speed of $1.4\\times$ faster than ViTPose-Base.

However, existing 3D datasets and methods are often limited to specific tasks. On the other hand, recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) have demonstrated exceptional general language and imagery tasking performance. Therefore, it is interesting to unlock MLM's potential to be 3D generalist for wider tasks. However, current MLMs' research has been less focused on 3D tasks due to a lack of large-scale 3D instruction-following datasets. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive 3D instructionfollowing dataset called M3DBench, which possesses the following characteristics: 1) It supports general multimodal instructions interleaved with text, images, 3D objects, and other visual prompts. 2) It unifies diverse 3D tasks at both region and scene levels, covering a variety of fundamental abilities in real-world 3D environments. 3) It is a large-scale 3D instruction-following dataset with over 320k instruction-response pairs. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark for assessing the performance of large models in understanding multi-modal 3D prompts.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in synthesizing computer programs based on a natural language prompt, mitigating the gap between natural language and structured programs. Our paper focuses on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs for semantic parsing tasks, addressing the following three key research questions: 1) How can LLMs be effectively utilized for semantic parsing tasks? 2) What defines an effective prompt? and 3) How can LLM overcome the length constraint and streamline prompt design by including all examples as prompts? We introduce k Nearest Neighbor In-Context Learning(kNN-ICL), which simplifies prompt engineering by allowing it to be built on top of any design strategy while providing access to all demo examples. Extensive experiments show that: 1)Simple ICL without kNN search can achieve a comparable performance with strong supervised models on the TOP tasks, and 2) kNN-ICL significantly improves the comprehension of complex requests by seamlessly integrating ICL with a nearest-neighbor approach.

Hence, we adopt this setting and explore how to edit images through latent space manipulation. We introduce an editing space, which we call $u$-space, that can be manipulated in a controllable, accumulative, and composable manner. Additionally, we propose a tailored sampling solution to enable sampling with the more efficient adaptive step-size ODE solvers. Lastly, we put forth a straightforward yet powerful method for achieving fine-grained and nuanced editing using text prompts.

The primary objective is to investigate the presence of gender biases, disparities, and fairness in generally targeted training samples with mixed-gender datasets in AI scoring outcomes. Utilizing a fine-tuned version of BERT and GPT-3.5, this research analyzes more than 1000 human-graded student responses from male and female participants across six assessment items. The study employs three distinct techniques for bias analysis: Scoring accuracy difference to evaluate bias, mean score gaps by gender (MSG) to evaluate disparity, and Equalized Odds (EO) to evaluate fairness. The results indicate that scoring accuracy for mixed-trained models shows an insignificant difference from either male- or female-trained models, suggesting no significant scoring bias. Consistently with both BERT and GPT-3.5, we found that mixed-trained models generated fewer MSG and non-disparate predictions compared to humans. In contrast, compared to humans, gender-specifically trained models yielded larger MSG, indicating that unbalanced training data may create algorithmic models to enlarge gender disparities. The EO analysis suggests that mixed-trained models generated more fairness outcomes compared with gender-specifically trained models. Collectively, the findings suggest that gender-unbalanced data do not necessarily generate scoring bias but can enlarge gender disparities and reduce scoring fairness. "

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation methods have recently shown to be a promising direction to speedup the synthesis of large-scale diffusion models by requiring only a few inference steps. While several powerful distillation methods were recently proposed, the overall quality of student samples is typically lower compared to the teacher ones, which hinders their practical usage. In this work, we investigate the relative quality of samples produced by the teacher text-to-image diffusion model and its distilled student version. As our main empirical finding, we discover that a noticeable portion of student samples exhibit superior fidelity compared to the teacher ones, despite the ``approximate'' nature of the student. Based on this finding, we propose an adaptive collaboration between student and teacher diffusion models for effective text-to-image synthesis. Specifically, the distilled model produces the initial sample, and then an oracle decides whether it needs further improvements with a slow teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the designed pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art text-to-image alternatives for various inference budgets in terms of human preference. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be naturally used in popular applications such as text-guided image editing and controllable generation. "

However, previous face swapping methods that used generative adversarial networks (GANs) as backbones have faced challenges such as inconsistency in blending, distortions, artifacts, and issues with training stability. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative end-to-end framework for high-fidelity face swapping. First, we introduce a StyleGAN-based facial attributes encoder that extracts essential features from faces and inverts them into a latent style code, encapsulating indispensable facial attributes for successful face swapping. Second, we introduce an attention-based style blending module to effectively transfer Face IDs from source to target. To ensure accurate and quality transferring, a series of constraint measures including contrastive face ID learning, facial landmark alignment, and dual swap consistency is implemented. Finally, the blended style code is translated back to the image space via the style decoder, which is of high training stability and generative capability. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ dataset highlight the superior visual quality of generated images from our face-swapping methodology when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and the effectiveness of each proposed module.

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to infer user preferences from historical interaction sequences and predict the next item that users may be interested in the future. The current mainstream design approach is to represent items as fixed vectors, capturing the underlying relationships between items and user preferences based on the order of interactions. However, relying on a single fixed-item embedding may weaken the modeling capability of the system, and the global dynamics and local saliency exhibited by user preferences need to be distinguished. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel diffusion recommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm (AREAL). We introduce diffusion models into the recommend system, representing items as probability distributions instead of fixed vectors. This approach enables adaptive reflection of multiple aspects of the items and generates item distributions in a denoising manner. We use multi-scale cnn and residual lstm methods to extract the local and global dependency features of user history interactions, and use attention mechanism to distinguish weights as the guide features of reverse diffusion recovery. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets. Specifically, AREAL obtains improvements over the best baselines by 2.63% and 4.25% in terms of HR@20 and 5.05% and 3.94% in terms of NDCG@20 on all datasets. "

Due to the lack of supervision and category information, current methods usually perform poorly on novel categories and struggle to reveal semantic meanings of the discovered clusters, which limits their applications in the real world. To mitigate above issues, we propose Loop, an end-to-end active-learning framework that introduces Large Language Models (LLMs) into the training loop, which can boost model performance and generate category names without relying on any human efforts. Specifically, we first propose Local Inconsistent Sampling (LIS) to select samples that have a higher probability of falling to wrong clusters, based on neighborhood prediction consistency and entropy of cluster assignment probabilities. Then we propose a Scalable Query strategy to allow LLMs to choose true neighbors of the selected samples from multiple candidate samples. Based on the feedback from LLMs, we perform Refined Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (RNCL) to pull samples and their neighbors closer to learn clustering-friendly representations. Finally, we select representative samples from clusters corresponding to novel categories to allow LLMs to generate category names for them. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that Loop outperforms SOTA models by a large margin and generates accurate category names for the discovered clusters. We will release our code and data after publication. "

        "abstract": "Node representation learning by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely explored. However, in recent years, compelling evidence has revealed that GNN-based node representation learning can be substantially deteriorated by delicately-crafted perturbations in a graph structure. To learn robust node representation in the presence of perturbations, various works have been proposed to safeguard GNNs. Within these existing works, Bayesian label transition has been proven to be more effective, but this method is extensively reliant on a well-built prior distribution. The variational inference could address this limitation by sampling the latent node embedding from a Gaussian prior distribution. Besides, leveraging the Gaussian distribution (noise) in hidden layers is an appealing strategy to strengthen the robustness of GNNs. However, our experiments indicate that such a strategy can cause over-smoothing issues during node aggregation. In this work, we propose the Graph Variational Diffusion Network (GVDN), a new node encoder that effectively manipulates Gaussian noise to safeguard robustness on perturbed graphs while alleviating over-smoothing issues through two mechanisms: Gaussian diffusion and node embedding propagation. Thanks to these two mechanisms, our model can generate robust node embeddings for recovery. Specifically, we design a retraining mechanism using the generated node embedding to recover the performance of node classifications in the presence of perturbations. The experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed model across six public datasets. "

However, while image datasets for object detection have grown and continue to proliferate (the current most extensive public set, ImageNet, contains over 14m images with over 14m instances), the same cannot be said for textual caption datasets. While they have certainly been growing in recent years, caption datasets present a much more difficult challenge due to language differences, grammar, and the time it takes for humans to generate them. Current datasets have certainly provided many instances to work with, but it becomes problematic when a captioner may have a more limited vocabulary, one may not be adequately fluent in the language, or there are simple grammatical mistakes. These difficulties are increased when the images get more specific, such as remote sensing images. This paper aims to address this issue of potential information and communication shortcomings in caption datasets. To provide a more precise analysis, we specify our domain of images to be remote sensing images in the RSICD dataset and experiment with the captions provided here.

However, the learning capability is rarely explored in existing methods, as they freeze the used tools after deployment, thereby limiting the generalization to new environments requiring specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose CLOVA, a Closed-LOop Visual Assistant to address this limitation, which encompasses inference, reflection, and learning phases in a closed-loop framework. During inference, LLMs generate programs and execute corresponding tools to accomplish given tasks. The reflection phase introduces a multimodal global-local reflection scheme to analyze whether and which tool needs to be updated based on environmental feedback. Lastly, the learning phase uses three flexible manners to collect training data in real-time and introduces a novel prompt tuning scheme to update the tools, enabling CLOVA to efficiently learn specific knowledge for new environments without human involvement. Experiments show that CLOVA outperforms tool-usage methods by 5% in visual question answering and multiple-image reasoning tasks, by 10% in knowledge tagging tasks, and by 20% in image editing tasks, highlighting the significance of the learning capability for general visual assistants.

This methodology effectively employs historical data from the source domain to reduce negative transfer from the data distribution perspective, while also using physical constraints to build a robust and reliable prediction model that integrates various types of data. The methodology starts by dividing the production data from the source domain into multiple subdomains, thereby enhancing data diversity. It then uses Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and global average distance measures to decide on the feasibility of transfer. Through domain adaptation, we integrate all transferable knowledge, resulting in a more comprehensive target model. Lastly, by incorporating drilling, completion, and geological data as physical constraints, we develop a hybrid model. This model, a combination of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a Transformer (Transformer-MLP), is designed to maximize interpretability. Experimental validation in China's southwestern region confirms the method's effectiveness. "

Recent NeRF-based approaches have shown superiority in quality and fidelity compared to previous studies. However, when it comes to few-shot talking head generation, a practical scenario where only few seconds of talking video is available for one identity, two limitations emerge: 1) they either have no base model, which serves as a facial prior for fast convergence, or ignore the importance of audio when building the prior; 2) most of them overlook the degree of correlation between different face regions and audio, e.g., mouth is audio related, while ear is audio independent.

Many approaches have been proposed to augment API documentation by summarizing complementary information from external resources such as Stack Overflow. Existing extractive-based summarization approaches excel in producing faithful summaries that accurately represent the source content without input length restrictions. Nevertheless, they suffer from inherent readability limitations. On the other hand, our empirical study on the abstractive-based summarization method, i.e., GPT-4, reveals that GPT-4 can generate coherent and concise summaries but presents limitations in terms of informativeness and faithfulness.

Then, to improve speaker diarization, we propose a novel speaker mask branch to detection the speech segments of individual speakers. With the proposed model, we can perform both speech recognition and speaker diarization tasks simultaneously using a single model. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech-based overlapped dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both speech recognition and speaker diarization tasks, particularly enhancing the accuracy of speaker diarization in relatively complex multi-talker scenarios.

        "abstract": "Text-guided motion synthesis aims to generate 3D human motion that not only precisely reflects the textual description but reveals the motion details as much as possible. Pioneering methods explore the diffusion model for text-to-motion synthesis and obtain significant superiority. However, these methods conduct diffusion processes either on the raw data distribution or the low-dimensional latent space, which typically suffer from the problem of modality inconsistency or detail-scarce. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Basic-to-Advanced Hierarchical Diffusion Model, named B2A-HDM, to collaboratively exploit low-dimensional and high-dimensional diffusion models for high quality detailed motion synthesis. Specifically, the basic diffusion model in low-dimensional latent space provides the intermediate denoising result that to be consistent with the textual description, while the advanced diffusion model in high-dimensional latent space focuses on the following detail-enhancing denoising process. Besides, we introduce a multi-denoiser framework for the advanced diffusion model to ease the learning of high-dimensional model and fully explore the generative potential of the diffusion model. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results on two text-to-motion benchmarks (HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that B2A-HDM can outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity, modality consistency, and diversity.

However, implementing such architectures presents two main challenges: flexibility in handling irregular and arbitrary input and output formats and scalability to large discretizations. Most existing architectures are limited by their desired structure or infeasible to scale large inputs and outputs. To address these issues, we introduce an attention-based model called an inducing-point operator transformer (IPOT). Inspired by inducing points methods, IPOT is designed to handle any input function and output query while capturing global interactions in a computationally efficient way. By detaching the inputs/outputs discretizations from the processor with a smaller latent bottleneck, IPOT offers flexibility in processing arbitrary discretizations and scales linearly with the size of inputs/outputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IPOT achieves strong performances with manageable computational complexity on an extensive range of PDE benchmarks and real-world weather forecasting scenarios, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

        "abstract": "We introduce the Cross Human Motion Diffusion Model (CrossDiff), a novel approach for generating high-quality human motion based on textual descriptions. Our method integrates 3D and 2D information using a shared transformer network within the training of the diffusion model, unifying motion noise into a single feature space. This enables cross-decoding of features into both 3D and 2D motion representations, regardless of their original dimension. The primary advantage of CrossDiff is its cross-diffusion mechanism, which allows the model to reverse either 2D or 3D noise into clean motion during training. This capability leverages the complementary information in both motion representations, capturing intricate human movement details often missed by models relying solely on 3D information. Consequently, CrossDiff effectively combines the strengths of both representations to generate more realistic motion sequences. In our experiments, our model demonstrates competitive state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion benchmarks. Moreover, our method consistently provides enhanced motion generation quality, capturing complex full-body movement intricacies. Additionally, with a pretrained model,our approach accommodates using in the wild 2D motion data without 3D motion ground truth during training to generate 3D motion, highlighting its potential for broader applications and efficient use of available data resources.

Furthermore, it discusses how to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG models, introducing two evaluation methods for RAG, emphasizing key metrics and abilities for evaluation, and presenting the latest automatic evaluation framework.

This paper proposes Implicit Diffusion-based reBLurring AUgmentation (ID-Blau), utilizing a sharp image paired with a controllable blur condition map to produce a corresponding blurred image. We parameterize the blur patterns of a blurred image with their orientations and magnitudes as a pixel-wise blur condition map to simulate motion trajectories and implicitly represent them in a continuous space. By sampling diverse blur conditions, ID-Blau can generate various blurred images unseen in the training set. Experimental results demonstrate that ID-Blau can produce realistic blurred images for training and thus significantly improve performance for state-of-the-art deblurring models. "

This paper proposes SinMPI, a novel method that uses an expanded multiplane image (MPI) as the 3D scene representation to significantly expand the perspective range of MPI and generate high-quality novel views from a large multiplane space. The key idea of our method is to use Stable Diffusion to generate out-of-view contents, project all scene contents into an expanded multiplane image according to depths predicted by monocular depth estimators, and then optimize the multiplane image under the supervision of pseudo multi-view data generated by a depth-aware warping and inpainting module. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.

        "abstract": "Point cloud-based 3D object tracking is an important task in autonomous driving. Though great advances regarding Siamese-based 3D tracking have been made recently, it remains challenging to learn the correlation between the template and search branches effectively with the sparse LIDAR point cloud data. Instead of performing correlation of the two branches at just one point in the network, in this paper, we present a multi-correlation Siamese Transformer network that has multiple stages and carries out feature correlation at the end of each stage based on sparse pillars. More specifically, in each stage, self-attention is first applied to each branch separately to capture the non-local context information. Then, cross-attention is used to inject the template information into the search area. This strategy allows the feature learning of the search area to be aware of the template while keeping the individual characteristics of the template intact. To enable the network to easily preserve the information learned at different stages and ease the optimization, for the search area, we densely connect the initial input sparse pillars and the output of each stage to all subsequent stages and the target localization network, which converts pillars to bird's eye view (BEV) feature maps and predicts the state of the target with a small densely connected convolution network. Deep supervision is added to each stage to further boost the performance as well. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the popular KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art. Ablation study that shows the effectiveness of each component is provided as well. Code is available at https://github.com/liangp/MCSTN-3DSOT. "

In this paper, we propose DataElixir, a novel sanitization approach tailored to purify poisoned datasets. We leverage diffusion models to eliminate trigger features and restore benign features, thereby turning the poisoned samples into benign ones. Specifically, with multiple iterations of the forward and reverse process, we extract intermediary images and their predicted labels for each sample in the original dataset. Then, we identify anomalous samples in terms of the presence of label transition of the intermediary images, detect the target label by quantifying distribution discrepancy, select their purified images considering pixel and feature distance, and determine their ground-truth labels by training a benign model. Experiments conducted on 9 popular attacks demonstrates that DataElixir effectively mitigates various complex attacks while exerting minimal impact on benign accuracy, surpassing the performance of baseline defense methods.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a learnable solver tailored to solve discretized linear partial differential equations (PDEs). This solver requires only problem-specific training data, without using specialized expertise. Its development is anchored by three core principles: (1) a multilevel hierarchy to promote rapid convergence, (2) adherence to linearity concerning the right-hand side of equations, and (3) weights sharing across different levels to facilitate adaptability to various problem sizes. Built on these foundational principles, we introduce a network adept at solving PDEs discretized on structured grids, even when faced with heterogeneous coefficients. The cornerstone of our proposed solver is the convolutional neural network (CNN), chosen for its capacity to learn from structured data and its similar computation pattern as multigrid components. To evaluate its effectiveness, the solver was trained to solve convection-diffusion equations featuring heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. The solver exhibited swift convergence to high accuracy over a range of grid sizes, extending from $31 \\times 31$ to $4095 \\times 4095$. Remarkably, our method outperformed the classical Geometric Multigrid (GMG) solver, demonstrating a speedup of approximately 3 to 8 times. Furthermore, we explored the solver's generalizability to untrained coefficient distributions. The findings showed consistent reliability across various other coefficient distributions, revealing that when trained on a mixed coefficient distribution, the solver is nearly as effective in generalizing to all types of coefficient distributions.

        "abstract": "Transformers have recently emerged as powerful neural networks for graph learning, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on several graph property prediction tasks. However, these results have been limited to small-scale graphs, where the computational feasibility of the global attention mechanism is possible. The next goal is to scale up these architectures to handle very large graphs on the scale of millions or even billions of nodes. With large-scale graphs, global attention learning is proven impractical due to its quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes. On the other hand, neighborhood sampling techniques become essential to manage large graph sizes, yet finding the optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy with sampling techniques remains challenging. This work advances representation learning on single large-scale graphs with a focus on identifying model characteristics and critical design constraints for developing scalable graph transformer (GT) architectures. We argue such GT requires layers that can adeptly learn both local and global graph representations while swiftly sampling the graph topology. As such, a key innovation of this work lies in the creation of a fast neighborhood sampling technique coupled with a local attention mechanism that encompasses a 4-hop reception field, but achieved through just 2-hop operations. This local node embedding is then integrated with a global node embedding, acquired via another self-attention layer with an approximate global codebook, before finally sent through a downstream layer for node predictions. The proposed GT framework, named LargeGT, overcomes previous computational bottlenecks and is validated on three large-scale node classification benchmarks. We report a 3x speedup and 16.8% performance gain on ogbn-products and snap-patents, while we also scale LargeGT on ogbn-papers100M with a 5.9% performance improvement. "

        "abstract": "Transformers have been recently explored for 3D point cloud understanding with impressive progress achieved. A large number of points, over 0.1 million, make the global self-attention infeasible for point cloud data. Thus, most methods propose to apply the transformer in a local region, e.g., spherical or cubic window. However, it still contains a large number of Query-Key pairs, which requires high computational costs. In addition, previous methods usually learn the query, key, and value using a linear projection without modeling the local 3D geometric structure. In this paper, we attempt to reduce the costs and model the local geometry prior by developing a new transformer block, named ConDaFormer. Technically, ConDaFormer disassembles the cubic window into three orthogonal 2D planes, leading to fewer points when modeling the attention in a similar range. The disassembling operation is beneficial to enlarging the range of attention without increasing the computational complexity, but ignores some contexts. To provide a remedy, we develop a local structure enhancement strategy that introduces a depth-wise convolution before and after the attention. This scheme can also capture the local geometric information. Taking advantage of these designs, ConDaFormer captures both long-range contextual information and local priors. The effectiveness is demonstrated by experimental results on several 3D point cloud understanding benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/LHDuan/ConDaFormer . "

        "abstract": "Pattern recognition based on RGB-Event data is a newly arising research topic and previous works usually learn their features using CNN or Transformer. As we know, CNN captures the local features well and the cascaded self-attention mechanisms are good at extracting the long-range global relations. It is intuitive to combine them for high-performance RGB-Event based video recognition, however, existing works fail to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and model parameters, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{firstimage}. In this work, we propose a novel RGB-Event based recognition framework termed TSCFormer, which is a relatively lightweight CNN-Transformer model. Specifically, we mainly adopt the CNN as the backbone network to first encode both RGB and Event data. Meanwhile, we initialize global tokens as the input and fuse them with RGB and Event features using the BridgeFormer module. It captures the global long-range relations well between both modalities and maintains the simplicity of the whole model architecture at the same time. The enhanced features will be projected and fused into the RGB and Event CNN blocks, respectively, in an interactive manner using F2E and F2V modules. Similar operations are conducted for other CNN blocks to achieve adaptive fusion and local-global feature enhancement under different resolutions. Finally, we concatenate these three features and feed them into the classification head for pattern recognition. Extensive experiments on two large-scale RGB-Event benchmark datasets (PokerEvent and HARDVS) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed TSCFormer.

We propose a multilingual text detection model to address the issues of low accuracy and high difficulty in detecting multilingual text in natural scenes. In response to the challenges posed by multilingual text images with multiple character sets and various font styles, we introduce the SFM Swin Transformer feature extraction network to enhance the model's robustness in detecting characters and fonts across different languages. Dealing with the considerable variation in text scales and complex arrangements in natural scene text images, we present the AS-HRFPN feature fusion network by incorporating an Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion module and a Spatial Pyramid Pooling module. The feature fusion network improvements enhance the model's ability to detect text sizes and orientations. Addressing diverse backgrounds and font variations in multilingual scene text images is a challenge for existing methods. Limited local receptive fields hinder detection performance. To overcome this, we propose a Global Semantic Segmentation Branch, extracting and preserving global features for more effective text detection, aligning with the need for comprehensive information.

Previous neural legal case retrieval models mostly encode the unstructured raw text of case into a case representation, which causes the lack of important legal structural information in a case and leads to poor case representation; (2) Lengthy legal text limitation. When using the powerful BERT-based models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. In this paper, a graph neural networks-based legal case retrieval model, CaseGNN, is developed to tackle these challenges. To effectively utilise the legal structural information during encoding, a case is firstly converted into a Text-Attributed Case Graph (TACG), followed by a designed Edge Graph Attention Layer and a readout function to obtain the case graph representation. The CaseGNN model is optimised with a carefully designed contrastive loss with easy and hard negative sampling. Since the text attributes in the case graph come from individual sentences, the restriction of using language models is further avoided without losing the legal context. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmarks from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023, which demonstrate that CaseGNN outperforms other state-of-the-art legal case retrieval methods. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/CaseGNN. "

        "abstract": "Vision-based grasping of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a key challenge for autonomous robotic manipulation. A practical grasp synthesis system is required to generate a diverse set of 6-DoF grasps from which a task-relevant grasp can be executed. Although generative models are suitable for learning such complex data distributions, existing models have limitations in grasp quality, long training times, and a lack of flexibility for task-specific generation. In this work, we present GraspLDM- a modular generative framework for 6-DoF grasp synthesis that uses diffusion models as priors in the latent space of a VAE. GraspLDM learns a generative model of object-centric $SE(3)$ grasp poses conditioned on point clouds. GraspLDM's architecture enables us to train task-specific models efficiently by only re-training a small de-noising network in the low-dimensional latent space, as opposed to existing models that need expensive re-training. Our framework provides robust and scalable models on both full and single-view point clouds. GraspLDM models trained with simulation data transfer well to the real world and provide an 80\\% success rate for 80 grasp attempts of diverse test objects, improving over existing generative models.

        "abstract": "Coarse-to-fine 3D instance segmentation methods show weak performances compared to recent Grouping-based, Kernel-based and Transformer-based methods. We argue that this is due to two limitations: 1) Instance size overestimation by axis-aligned bounding box(AABB) 2) False negative error accumulation from inaccurate box to the refinement phase. In this work, we introduce Spherical Mask, a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical representation, overcoming those two limitations with several benefits. Specifically, our coarse detection estimates each instance with a 3D polygon using a center and radial distance predictions, which avoids excessive size estimation of AABB. To cut the error propagation in the existing coarse-to-fine approaches, we virtually migrate points based on the polygon, allowing all foreground points, including false negatives, to be refined. During inference, the proposal and point migration modules run in parallel and are assembled to form binary masks of instances. We also introduce two margin-based losses for the point migration to enforce corrections for the false positives/negatives and cohesion of foreground points, significantly improving the performance. Experimental results from three datasets, such as ScanNetV2, S3DIS, and STPLS3D, show that our proposed method outperforms existing works, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new instance representation with spherical coordinates.

We explore whether we can compress transformer-based sentence embeddings into a representation that separates different linguistic signals -- in particular, information relevant to subject-verb agreement and verb alternations. We show that by compressing an input sequence that shares a targeted phenomenon into the latent layer of a variational autoencoder-like system, the targeted linguistic information becomes more explicit. A latent layer with both discrete and continuous components captures better the targeted phenomena than a latent layer with only discrete or only continuous components. These experiments are a step towards separating linguistic signals from distributed text embeddings and linking them to more symbolic representations. "

However, the absence of Knowledge Graph (KG) environment awareness and the challenge of engineering viable optimization mechanisms for intermediary reasoning processes, constrict the performance of LLMs on KG reasoning tasks compared to smaller models. We introduce LLM-ARK, a LLM grounded KG reasoning agent designed to deliver precise and adaptable predictions on KG paths. LLM-ARK utilizes Full Textual Environment (FTE) prompts to assimilate state information for each step-sized intelligence. Leveraging LLMs to richly encode and represent various types of inputs and integrate the knowledge graph further with path environment data, before making the final decision. Reframing the Knowledge Graph (KG) multi-hop inference problem as a sequential decision-making issue, we optimize our model using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) online policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm which allows the model to learn from a vast array of reward signals across diverse tasks and environments.

        "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in their application to sequential recommendation tasks as they can provide supportive item information. However, due to the inherent complexities of sequential recommendation, such as sequential patterns across datasets, noise within sequences, and the temporal evolution of user preferences, existing LLM reasoning strategies, such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought are not fully effective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reasoning principle: Dynamic Reflection with Divergent Thinking within a retriever-reranker framework. Our approach starts with a collaborative in-context demonstration retriever, which collects sequences exhibiting collaborative behaviors as in-context examples. Following this, we abstract high-level user preferences across multiple aspects, providing a more nuanced understanding of user interests and circumventing the noise within the raw sequences. The cornerstone of our methodology is dynamic reflection, a process that emulates human learning through probing, critiquing, and reflecting, using user feedback to tailor the analysis more effectively to the target user in a temporal manner. We evaluate our approach on three datasets using six pre-trained LLMs. The superior performance observed across these models demonstrates the efficacy of our reasoning strategy, notably achieved without the need to fine-tune the LLMs. With our principle, we managed to outperform GPT-Turbo-3.5 on three datasets using 7b models e.g., Vicuna-7b and Openchat-7b on NDCG@10. This research not only highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing sequential recommendation systems but also underscores the importance of developing tailored reasoning strategies to fully harness their capabilities.

In this paper, we highlight the issue of explanation and prediction coherence by 1) presenting results from a manual verification of explanations generated by one of the state-of-the-art approaches 2) proposing a method of automatic coherence evaluation 3) introducing a new transformer-based method that aims to produce more coherent explanations than the state-of-the-art approaches 4) performing an experimental evaluation which demonstrates that this method significantly improves the explanation coherence without affecting the other aspects of recommendation performance.

However, prior works lack a comprehensive evaluation of different language families, making it challenging to evaluate LLM robustness against errors in external retrieved knowledge. To overcome this, we establish NoMIRACL, a human-annotated dataset for evaluating LLM robustness in RAG across 18 typologically diverse languages. NoMIRACL includes both a non-relevant and a relevant subset. Queries in the non-relevant subset contain passages manually judged as non-relevant or noisy, whereas queries in the relevant subset include at least a single judged relevant passage. We measure LLM robustness using two metrics: (i) hallucination rate, measuring model tendency to hallucinate an answer, when the answer is not present in passages in the non-relevant subset, and (ii) error rate, measuring model inaccuracy to recognize relevant passages in the relevant subset. We build a GPT-4 baseline which achieves a 33.2% hallucination rate on the non-relevant and a 14.9% error rate on the relevant subset on average. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4 hallucinates frequently in high-resource languages, such as French or English. This work highlights an important avenue for future research to improve LLM robustness to learn how to better reject non-relevant information in RAG. "

To overcome these challenges, we take advantage of the unique characteristics of geometric problems (such as unique geometric logical form, and geometric scalability) and the capacity of the textual LLMs to build an enriched multimodal geometry dataset based on existing data.

Hypergraph neural networks emerge as a powerful tool for processing hypergraph-structured data, delivering remarkable performance across various tasks, e.g., hypergraph node classification. However, these models struggle to capture global structural information due to their reliance on local message passing. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hypergraph learning framework, HyperGraph Transformer (HyperGT). HyperGT uses a Transformer-based neural network architecture to effectively consider global correlations among all nodes and hyperedges. To incorporate local structural information, HyperGT has two distinct designs: i) a positional encoding based on the hypergraph incidence matrix, offering valuable insights into node-node and hyperedge-hyperedge interactions; and ii) a hypergraph structure regularization in the loss function, capturing connectivities between nodes and hyperedges. Through these designs, HyperGT achieves comprehensive hypergraph representation learning by effectively incorporating global interactions while preserving local connectivity patterns. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world hypergraph node classification tasks showcase that HyperGT consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies affirm the effectiveness of the individual designs of our model. "

UFLS plays a vital role in maintaining system stability by shedding load when the frequency drops below a specified threshold following loss of generation. Using a dynamic System Frequency Response (SFR) model we generate different values of UFLS (i.e., labels) predicated on a set of carefully selected operating conditions (i.e., features). Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are then applied to learn the relationship between chosen features and the UFLS labels. A novel regression tree and the Tobit model are suggested for this purpose and we show how the resulting non-linear model can be directly incorporated into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The trained model can be used to estimate UFLS in security-constrained operational planning problems, improving frequency response, optimizing reserve allocation, and reducing costs. The methodology is applied to the La Palma island power system, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness. The results confirm that the amount of UFLS can be estimated with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as small as 0.213 MW for the whole process, with a model that is representable as a MILP for use in scheduling problems such as unit commitment among others.

Recent research has introduced tuning methods that make subtle adjustments to the original models, yielding promising results in specific adaptations of foundational generative diffusion models. Rather than modifying the main backbone of the diffusion model, we delve into the role of skip connection in U-Net and reveal that hierarchical features aggregating long-distance information across encoder and decoder make a significant impact on the content and quality of image generation. Based on the observation, we propose an efficient generative tuning framework, dubbed SCEdit, which integrates and edits Skip Connection using a lightweight tuning module named SC-Tuner. Furthermore, the proposed framework allows for straightforward extension to controllable image synthesis by injecting different conditions with Controllable SC-Tuner, simplifying and unifying the network design for multi-condition inputs. Our SCEdit substantially reduces training parameters, memory usage, and computational expense due to its lightweight tuners, with backward propagation only passing to the decoder blocks.

In contrast to methods that use alternate 3D shape representations (e.g. implicit representations), our approach is a discrete denoising diffusion probabilistic model that operates natively on the polygonal mesh data structure. This enables learning of both the geometric properties of vertices and the topological characteristics of faces. Specifically, we treat meshes as quantized triangle soups, progressively corrupted with categorical noise in the forward diffusion phase. In the reverse diffusion phase, a transformer-based denoising network is trained to revert the noising process, restoring the original mesh structure. At inference, new meshes can be generated by applying this denoising network iteratively, starting with a completely noisy triangle soup. Consequently, our model is capable of producing high-quality 3D polygonal meshes, ready for integration into downstream 3D workflows. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that PolyDiff achieves a significant advantage (avg. FID and JSD improvement of 18.2 and 5.8 respectively) over current state-of-the-art methods. "

Moreover, when benchmarked against other tuning approaches like full parameter finetuning or LoRA, its benefits on efficiency are substantial. For example, when compared to LoRA on a 13B model scale, performance can be enhanced by an average of over 20% across five multi-modal tasks, and meanwhile, results in a significant reduction of trainable parameters by 41.9% and a decrease in GPU memory usage by 17.6%. On top of this LayerNorm strategy, we showcase that selectively tuning only with conversational data can improve efficiency further. Beyond these empirical outcomes, we provide a comprehensive analysis to explore the role of LayerNorm in adapting LLMs to the multi-modal domain and improving the expressive power of the model. "

Many works have been proposed for inverting images into StyleGAN's latent space.

That is because low-rate latent spaces lose many image details due to the information bottleneck even though it provides an editable space. On the other hand, higher-rate latent spaces can pass all the image details to StyleGAN for perfect reconstruction of images but suffer from low editing qualities. In this work, we present a novel image inversion architecture that extracts high-rate latent features and includes a flow estimation module to warp these features to adapt them to edits. The flows are estimated from StyleGAN features of edited and unedited latent codes. By estimating the high-rate features and warping them for edits, we achieve both high-fidelity to the input image and high-quality edits.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11459",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a pioneering 3D volumetric encoder designed for text-to-3D generation. To scale up the training data for the diffusion model, a lightweight network is developed to efficiently acquire feature volumes from multi-view images. The 3D volumes are then trained on a diffusion model for text-to-3D generation using a 3D U-Net. This research further addresses the challenges of inaccurate object captions and high-dimensional feature volumes. The proposed model, trained on the public Objaverse dataset, demonstrates promising outcomes in producing diverse and recognizable samples from text prompts. Notably, it empowers finer control over object part characteristics through textual cues, fostering model creativity by seamlessly combining multiple concepts within a single object. This research significantly contributes to the progress of 3D generation by introducing an efficient, flexible, and scalable representation methodology.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11461",
        "abstract": "Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D representation that harnesses the advantages of both explicit (mesh) and implicit (NeRF) 3D representations. In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11462",
        "abstract": "Speculative decoding enhances the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a draft model to draft for a larger target model to review. However, drafting in speculative decoding involves slow autoregressive generation and generating tokens of different importance with the same time allocation. These two inefficiencies lead to its suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS. Drafting), a novel approach that employs two types of cascades. The Vertical Cascade eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models. The Horizontal Cascade constitutes efficient time allocation in drafting with its optimality supported by our theoretical analysis. Combining both cascades, our CS. Drafting algorithm has achieved up to 72 percent additional speedup over speculative decoding in our experiments while keeping the same output distribution. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10052",
        "abstract": "Towards practical applications of Electroencephalography (EEG) data, lightweight acquisition devices, equipped with a few electrodes, result in a predicament where analysis methods can only leverage EEG data with extremely low spatial resolution. Recent methods mainly focus on using mathematical interpolation methods and Convolutional Neural Networks for EEG super-resolution (SR), but they suffer from high computation costs, extra bias, and few insights in spatiotemporal dependency modeling. To this end, we propose the ESTformer, an EEG SR framework utilizing spatiotemporal dependencies based on the Transformer. The ESTformer applies positional encoding methods and the Multi-head Self-attention mechanism to the space and time dimensions, which can learn spatial structural information and temporal functional variation. The ESTformer, with the fixed masking strategy, adopts a mask token to up-sample the low-resolution (LR) EEG data in case of disturbance from mathematical interpolation methods. On this basis, we design various Transformer blocks to construct the Spatial Interpolation Module (SIM) and the Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM). Finally, the ESTformer cascades the SIM and the TRM to capture and model spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG SR with fidelity. Extensive experimental results on two EEG datasets show the effectiveness of the ESTformer against previous state-of-the-art methods and verify the superiority of the SR data to the LR data in EEG-based downstream tasks of person identification and emotion recognition. The proposed ESTformer demonstrates the versatility of the Transformer for EEG SR tasks. "

        "abstract": "We introduce a new technique called Drapes to enhance the sensitivity in searches for new physics at the LHC. By training diffusion models on side-band data, we show how background templates for the signal region can be generated either directly from noise, or by partially applying the diffusion process to existing data. In the partial diffusion case, data can be drawn from side-band regions, with the inverse diffusion performed for new target conditional values, or from the signal region, preserving the distribution over the conditional property that defines the signal region. We apply this technique to the hunt for resonances using the LHCO di-jet dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art performance for background template generation using high level input features. We also show how Drapes can be applied to low level inputs with jet constituents, reducing the model dependence on the choice of input observables. Using jet constituents we can further improve sensitivity to the signal process, but observe a loss in performance where the signal significance before applying any selection is below 4$\\sigma$. "

We also explore different encoding techniques and introduce positional encoding into quantum self-attention neural networks leading to improved accuracy and faster convergence in text and image classification experiments. This paper also performs a comparative analysis of classical self-attention models and their quantum counterparts, helping shed light on the differences in these models and their performance. "

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) models can skillfully predict the El Ni\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts over 1.5 years ahead. However, concerns regarding the reliability of predictions made by DL methods persist, including potential overfitting issues and lack of interpretability. Here, we propose ResoNet, a DL model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architectures. This hybrid architecture design enables our model to adequately capture local SSTA as well as long-range inter-basin interactions across oceans. We show that ResoNet can robustly predict ESNO at lead times between 19 and 26 months, thus outperforming existing approaches in terms of the forecast horizon. According to an explainability method applied to ResoNet predictions of El Ni\\~no and La Ni\\~na events from 1- to 18-month lead, we find that it predicts the Ni\\~no3.4 index based on multiple physically reasonable mechanisms, such as the Recharge Oscillator concept, Seasonal Footprint Mechanism, and Indian Ocean capacitor effect. Moreover, we demonstrate that for the first time, the asymmetry between El Ni\\~no and La Ni\\~na development can be captured by ResoNet. Our results could help alleviate skepticism about applying DL models for ENSO prediction and encourage more attempts to discover and predict climate phenomena using AI methods. "

        "abstract": "The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) load balancing scheme is widely acknowledged for its effectiveness in minimizing the average response time for jobs in systems with identical servers. However, when applied to a heterogeneous server system with servers of different processing speeds, the JSQ scheme exhibits suboptimal performance. Recently, a variation of JSQ called the Speed-Aware-Join-the-Shortest-Queue (SA-JSQ) scheme has been shown to attain fluid limit optimality for systems with heterogeneous servers. In this paper, we examine the SA-JSQ scheme for heterogeneous server systems under the Halfin-Whitt regime. Our analysis begins by establishing that the scaled and centered version of the system state weakly converges to a diffusion process characterized by stochastic integral equations. Furthermore, we prove that the diffusion process is positive recurrent and the sequence of stationary measures for the scaled and centered queue length processes converge to the stationary measure for the limiting diffusion process. To achieve this result, we employ Stein's method with a generator expansion approach. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10716",
        "abstract": "Video compression is widely used in digital television, surveillance systems, and virtual reality. Real-time video decoding is crucial in practical scenarios. Recently, neural video compression (NVC) combines traditional coding with deep learning, achieving impressive compression efficiency. Nevertheless, the NVC models involve high computational costs and complex memory access patterns, challenging real-time hardware implementations. To relieve this burden, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design framework named NVCA for video decoding on resource-limited devices. Firstly, a CNN-Transformer hybrid network is developed to improve compression performance by capturing multi-scale non-local features. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm-based sparse strategy that leverages the dual advantages of pruning and fast algorithms, sufficiently reducing computational complexity while maintaining video compression efficiency. Secondly, a reconfigurable sparse computing core is designed to flexibly support sparse convolutions and deconvolutions based on the fast algorithm-based sparse strategy. Furthermore, a novel heterogeneous layer chaining dataflow is incorporated to reduce off-chip memory traffic stemming from extensive inter-frame motion and residual information. Thirdly, the overall architecture of NVCA is designed and synthesized in TSMC 28nm CMOS technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our design provides superior coding quality and up to 22.7x decoding speed improvements over other video compression designs. Meanwhile, our design achieves up to 2.2x improvements in energy efficiency compared to prior accelerators. "
