        "abstract": "Recent one-shot Neural Architecture Search algorithms rely on training a hardware-agnostic super-network tailored to a specific task and then extracting efficient sub-networks for different hardware platforms. Popular approaches separate the training of super-networks from the search for sub-networks, often employing predictors to alleviate the computational overhead associated with search. Additionally, certain methods also incorporate the quantization policy within the search space. However, while the quantization policy search for convolutional neural networks is well studied, the extension of these methods to transformers and especially foundation models remains under-explored. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using multi-objective search algorithms paired with lightly trained predictors, we can efficiently search for both the sub-network architecture and the corresponding quantization policy and outperform their respective baselines across different performance objectives such as accuracy, model size, and latency. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach performs well across both uni-modal (ViT and BERT) and multi-modal (BEiT-3) transformer-based architectures as well as convolutional architectures (ResNet). For certain networks, we demonstrate an improvement of up to $4.80x$ and $3.44x$ for latency and model size respectively, without degradation in accuracy compared to the fully quantized INT8 baselines.

        "abstract": "We present the \\textbf{D}ecoupled \\textbf{VI}deo \\textbf{S}egmentation (DVIS) framework, a novel approach for the challenging task of universal video segmentation, including video instance segmentation (VIS), video semantic segmentation (VSS), and video panoptic segmentation (VPS). Unlike previous methods that model video segmentation in an end-to-end manner, our approach decouples video segmentation into three cascaded sub-tasks: segmentation, tracking, and refinement. This decoupling design allows for simpler and more effective modeling of the spatio-temporal representations of objects, especially in complex scenes and long videos. Accordingly, we introduce two novel components: the referring tracker and the temporal refiner. These components track objects frame by frame and model spatio-temporal representations based on pre-aligned features. To improve the tracking capability of DVIS, we propose a denoising training strategy and introduce contrastive learning, resulting in a more robust framework named DVIS++. Furthermore, we evaluate DVIS++ in various settings, including open vocabulary and using a frozen pre-trained backbone. By integrating CLIP with DVIS++, we present OV-DVIS++, the first open-vocabulary universal video segmentation framework. We conduct extensive experiments on six mainstream benchmarks, including the VIS, VSS, and VPS datasets. Using a unified architecture, DVIS++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialized methods on these benchmarks in both close- and open-vocabulary settings.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various generative tasks with the predictive prowess of denoising model. Currently, these models employ a uniform denoising approach across all timesteps. However, the inherent variations in noisy latents at each timestep lead to conflicts during training, constraining the potential of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy termed Step-Adaptive Training. In the initial stage, a base denoising model is trained to encompass all timesteps. Subsequently, we partition the timesteps into distinct groups, fine-tuning the model within each group to achieve specialized denoising capabilities. Recognizing that the difficulties of predicting noise at different timesteps vary, we introduce a diverse model size requirement. We dynamically adjust the model size for each timestep by estimating task difficulty based on its signal-to-noise ratio before fine-tuning. This adjustment is facilitated by a proxy-based structural importance assessment mechanism, enabling precise and efficient pruning of the base denoising model. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy, demonstrating an improvement in the FID score on CIFAR10 by over 0.3 while utilizing only 80\\% of the computational resources. This innovative approach not only enhances model performance but also significantly reduces computational costs, opening new avenues for the development and application of diffusion models. "

To address these obstacles, we integrate the category commonality and personalized style into diffusion models. Concretely, we propose a Category-Wise Generator to enable large-scale background generation for the first time. A unique identifier in the prompt is assigned to each category, whose attention is located on the background by a mask-guided cross attention layer to learn the category-wise style. Furthermore, for products with specific and fine-grained requirements in layout, elements, etc, a Personality-Wise Generator is devised to learn such personalized style directly from a reference image to resolve textual ambiguities, and is trained in a self-supervised manner for more efficient training data usage. To advance research in this field, the first large-scale e-commerce product background generation dataset BG60k is constructed, which covers more than 60k product images from over 2k categories. Experiments demonstrate that our method could generate high-quality backgrounds for different categories, and maintain the personalized background style of reference images.

        "abstract": "Semantic image synthesis, i.e., generating images from user-provided semantic label maps, is an important conditional image generation task as it allows to control both the content as well as the spatial layout of generated images. Although diffusion models have pushed the state of the art in generative image modeling, the iterative nature of their inference process makes them computationally demanding. Other approaches such as GANs are more efficient as they only need a single feed-forward pass for generation, but the image quality tends to suffer on large and diverse datasets. In this work, we propose a new class of GAN discriminators for semantic image synthesis that generates highly realistic images by exploiting feature backbone networks pre-trained for tasks such as image classification. We also introduce a new generator architecture with better context modeling and using cross-attention to inject noise into latent variables, leading to more diverse generated images. Our model, which we dub DP-SIMS, achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality and consistency with the input label maps on ADE-20K, COCO-Stuff, and Cityscapes, surpassing recent diffusion models while requiring two orders of magnitude less compute for inference.

Previous methods using 2D diffusion priors to optimize neural radiance fields for generating room-scale scenes have shown unsatisfactory quality. This is primarily attributed to the limitations of 2D priors lacking 3D awareness and constraints in the training methodology. In this paper, we utilize a 3D diffusion prior, MVDiffusion, to optimize the 3D room-scale scene. Our contributions are in two aspects. Firstly, we propose a progressive view selection process to optimize NeRF. This involves dividing the training process into three stages, gradually expanding the camera sampling scope. Secondly, we propose the pose transformation method in the second stage. It will ensure MVDiffusion provide the accurate view guidance. As a result, ShowRoom3D enables the generation of rooms with improved structural integrity, enhanced clarity from any view, reduced content repetition, and higher consistency across different perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of user study. "

Despite the progress in this area, there is still a gap in the existing literature, particularly in the in-context generalization to new action spaces. While existing methods show high performance on new tasks created by different reward distributions, their architectural design and training process are not suited for the introduction of new actions during evaluation. We aim to bridge this gap by developing an architecture and training methodology specifically for the task of generalizing to new action spaces. Inspired by Headless LLM, we remove the dependence on the number of actions by directly predicting the action embeddings. Furthermore, we use random embeddings to force the semantic inference of actions from context and to prepare for the new unseen embeddings during test time. Using multi-armed bandit environments with a variable number of arms, we show that our model achieves the performance of the data generation algorithm without requiring retraining for each new environment.

However, we observed that this property is not followed by the existing RGB-only NeRF-SLAM. Therefore, we are motivated to introduce this prior into the RGB-only NeRF-SLAM pipeline. Unfortunately, the optimization through the volumetric rendering function does not facilitate easy integration of the desired prior. Instead, we observed that the opacity of ternary-type (TT) is well supported. In this work, we study why ternary-type opacity is well-suited and desired for the task at hand. In particular, we provide theoretical insights into the process of jointly optimizing radiance and opacity through the volumetric rendering process. Through exhaustive experiments on benchmark datasets, we validate our claim and provide insights into the optimization process, which we believe will unleash the potential of RGB-only NeRF-SLAM. To foster this line of research, we also propose a simple yet novel visual odometry scheme that uses a hybrid combination of volumetric and warping-based image renderings. More specifically, the proposed hybrid odometry (HO) additionally uses image warping-based coarse odometry, leading up to an order of magnitude final speed-up. Furthermore, we show that the proposed TT and HO well complement each other, offering state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in terms of both speed and accuracy. "

The ESPM applies a pyramid-based channel separation strategy, boosting feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. The PFEM, a novel fusion of CNN and Transformer structures, enables the concurrent extraction of local and global features, thereby providing a panoramic view of the image landscape. Our architecture integrates the PFEM in a manner that facilitates the streamlined exchange of feature information and allows for the further refinement of image texture details. Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in image resolution quality, while considerably decreasing computational and memory costs.

        "abstract": "Geometric transformations have been widely used to augment the size of training images. Existing methods often assume a unimodal distribution of the underlying transformations between images, which limits their power when data with multimodal distributions occur. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Multimodal Geometric Augmentation (MGAug), that for the first time generates augmenting transformations in a multimodal latent space of geometric deformations. To achieve this, we first develop a deep network that embeds the learning of latent geometric spaces of diffeomorphic transformations (a.k.a. diffeomorphisms) in a variational autoencoder (VAE). A mixture of multivariate Gaussians is formulated in the tangent space of diffeomorphisms and serves as a prior to approximate the hidden distribution of image transformations. We then augment the original training dataset by deforming images using randomly sampled transformations from the learned multimodal latent space of VAE. To validate the efficiency of our model, we jointly learn the augmentation strategy with two distinct domain-specific tasks: multi-class classification on 2D synthetic datasets and segmentation on real 3D brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). We also compare MGAug with state-of-the-art transformation-based image augmentation algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms all baselines by significantly improved prediction accuracy.

We harmonize the scale of poses and dense geometry, treating them as supervisory cues to train a neural implicit scene representation. NeRF-VO demonstrates exceptional performance in both photometric and geometric fidelity of the scene representation by jointly optimizing a sliding window of keyframed poses and the underlying dense geometry, which is accomplished through training the radiance field with volume rendering. We surpass state-of-the-art methods in pose estimation accuracy, novel view synthesis fidelity, and dense reconstruction quality across a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, while achieving a higher camera tracking frequency and consuming less GPU memory.

Such models can also serve for generating training data for machine learning approaches in settings where data is difficult to obtain or where too few training data exists, e.g. by providing novel views or images in varying conditions. While the vast amount of visual 3D reconstruction approaches focus on non-physical models, textured object surfaces or shapes, in this contribution we propose a volumetric reconstruction approach that obtains a physical model including the interior of partially translucent objects such as plankton or insects. Our technique photographs the object under different poses in front of a bright white light source and computes absorption and scattering per voxel. It can be interpreted as visual tomography that we solve by inverse raytracing. We additionally suggest a method to convert non-physical NeRF media into a physically-based volumetric grid for initialization and illustrate the usefulness of the approach using two real-world plankton validation sets, the lab-scanned models being finally also relighted and virtually submerged in a scenario with augmented medium and illumination conditions.

Different from existing datasets where the answer is compact and short, InfoVisDial contains long free-form answers with rich information in each round of dialogue. For effective data collection, the key idea is to bridge the large-scale multimodal model (e.g., GIT) and the language models (e.g., GPT-3). GIT can describe the image content even with scene text, while GPT-3 can generate informative dialogue based on the image description and appropriate prompting techniques. With such automatic pipeline, we can readily generate informative visual dialogue data at scale. Then, we ask human annotators to rate the generated dialogues to filter the low-quality conversations.Human analyses show that InfoVisDial covers informative and diverse dialogue topics: $54.4\\%$ of the dialogue rounds are related to image scene texts, and $36.7\\%$ require external knowledge. Each round's answer is also long and open-ended: $87.3\\%$ of answers are unique with an average length of $8.9$, compared with $27.37\\%$ and $2.9$ in VisDial. Last, we propose a strong baseline by adapting the GIT model for the visual dialogue task and fine-tune the model on InfoVisDial. Hopefully, our work can motivate more effort on this direction. "

        "abstract": "Video view synthesis, allowing for the creation of visually appealing frames from arbitrary viewpoints and times, offers immersive viewing experiences. Neural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static scenes, have spurred the creation of various methods for video view synthesis. However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a consequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a novel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called DyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion Decomposition-based Deblurring (MDD) stage. Our DyBluRF is the first that addresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The IRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate camera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the given blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays prediction (ILSP) approach for the blurry monocular video frames by decomposing the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DyBluRF outperforms qualitatively and quantitatively the very recent state-of-the-art methods.

Guided by CLIP's cross-modal image-text semantic alignment, this innovative approach enables us to simultaneously accomplish authentic attribute editing and cross-domain style transfer, a capability not realized in previous methods. Additionally, we ascertain that modifying only the weights of specific layers in the generator can yield an equivalent editing result.

Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to enhance the generalizability by minimizing worst-case loss using one-step gradient ascent as an approximation. However, as training progresses, the non-linearity of the loss landscape increases, rendering one-step gradient ascent less effective. On the other hand, multi-step gradient ascent will incur higher training cost. In this paper, we introduce a normalized Hessian trace to accurately measure the curvature of loss landscape on {\\em both} training and test sets.

The simultaneous achievement of expressive emotional talking and accurate lip-sync is particularly difficult, as expressiveness is often compromised for the accuracy of lip-sync. As widely adopted by many prior works, the LSTM network often fails to capture the subtleties and variations of emotional expressions. To address these challenges, we introduce DREAM-Talk, a two-stage diffusion-based audio-driven framework, tailored for generating diverse expressions and accurate lip-sync concurrently. In the first stage, we propose EmoDiff, a novel diffusion module that generates diverse highly dynamic emotional expressions and head poses in accordance with the audio and the referenced emotion style.

        "abstract": "Traditional interventions for academic procrastination often fail to capture the nuanced, individual-specific factors that underlie them. Large language models (LLMs) hold immense potential for addressing this gap by permitting open-ended inputs, including the ability to customize interventions to individuals' unique needs. However, user expectations and potential limitations of LLMs in this context remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted interviews and focus group discussions with 15 university students and 6 experts, during which a technology probe for generating personalized advice for managing procrastination was presented. Our results highlight the necessity for LLMs to provide structured, deadline-oriented steps and enhanced user support mechanisms. Additionally, our results surface the need for an adaptive approach to questioning based on factors like busyness. These findings offer crucial design implications for the development of LLM-based tools for managing procrastination while cautioning the use of LLMs for therapeutic guidance. "

To address this challenge, we propose Anchoring Path Sentence Transformer (APST) by introducing Anchoring Paths (APs) to alleviate the reliance of CPs. Specifically, we develop a search-based description retrieval method to enrich entity descriptions and an assessment mechanism to evaluate the rationality of APs. APST takes both APs and CPs as the inputs of a unified Sentence Transformer architecture, enabling comprehensive predictions and high-quality explanations. We evaluate APST on three public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 30 of 36 transductive, inductive, and few-shot experimental settings. "

We build upon a recent work, MagicPony, which learns articulated 3D animal shapes purely from single image collections, and extend it on two fronts. First, instead of training on static images, we augment the framework with a video training pipeline that incorporates temporal regularizations, achieving more accurate and temporally consistent reconstructions. Second, we learn a generative model of the underlying articulated 3D motion sequences via a spatio-temporal transformer VAE, simply using 2D reconstruction losses without relying on any explicit pose annotations. At inference time, given a single 2D image of a new animal instance, our model reconstructs an articulated, textured 3D mesh, and generates plausible 3D animations by sampling from the learned motion latent space.

SCD learns the underlying data distribution via a diffusion model which is then guided at test time to generate counterfactuals for any arbitrary black-box model, input, and desired prediction.

However, it is significantly challenging due to the scarcity of oracle character images. To overcome this issue, we propose Diff-Oracle, based on diffusion models (DMs), to generate sufficient controllable oracle characters. In contrast to most DMs that rely on text prompts, we incorporate a style encoder to control style information during the generation process. This encoder extracts style prompts from existing oracle character images, where style details are converted from a CLIP model into a text embedding format. Inspired by ControlNet, we introduce a content encoder to capture desired content information from content images, ensuring the fidelity of character glyphs. To train Diff-Oracle effectively, we propose to obtain pixel-level paired oracle character images (i.e., style and content images) by a pre-trained image-to-image translation model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, Oracle-241 and OBC306, demonstrate that our Diff-Oracle outperforms existing generative methods in terms of image generation, further enhancing recognition accuracy.

To address this challenge, we develop a new WSSS framework tailored to driving scene datasets. Based on extensive analysis of dataset characteristics, we employ Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) as our baseline to obtain pseudo-masks. However, CLIP introduces two key challenges: (1) pseudo-masks from CLIP lack in representing small object classes, and (2) these masks contain notable noise. We propose solutions for each issue as follows. (1) We devise Global-Local View Training that seamlessly incorporates small-scale patches during model training, thereby enhancing the model's capability to handle small-sized yet critical objects in driving scenes (e.g., traffic light). (2) We introduce Consistency-Aware Region Balancing (CARB), a novel technique that discerns reliable and noisy regions through evaluating the consistency between CLIP masks and segmentation predictions. It prioritizes reliable pixels over noisy pixels via adaptive loss weighting. Notably, the proposed method achieves 51.8\\% mIoU on the Cityscapes test dataset, showcasing its potential as a strong WSSS baseline on driving scene datasets.

Under a smooth restriction-a restriction to polynomials of bounded degree over a real closed field-we show that the quantitative problem, which consists in finding an upper-bound to the pre-expectation, can be decided in time double-exponential in the size of a program, thus providing, despite its great complexity, one of the first decidable results on the analysis and verification of quantum programs.

        "abstract": "Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have gained popularity recently due to their multipurpose and easy-to-use nature, e.g. image and video generation as well as editing. However, training a diffusion model specifically for 3D scene editing is not straightforward due to the lack of large-scale datasets. To date, editing 3D scenes requires either re-training the model to adapt to various 3D edited scenes or design-specific methods for each special editing type. Furthermore, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods require multiple synchronized edited images from the same scene to facilitate the scene editing. Due to the current limitations of T2I models, it is very challenging to apply consistent editing effects to multiple images, i.e. multi-view inconsistency in editing. This in turn compromises the desired 3D scene editing performance if these images are used. In our work, we propose a novel training-free 3D scene editing technique, Free-Editor, which allows users to edit 3D scenes without further re-training the model during test time. Our proposed method successfully avoids the multi-view style inconsistency issue in SOTA methods with the help of a \"single-view editing\" scheme. Specifically, we show that editing a particular 3D scene can be performed by only modifying a single view. To this end, we introduce an Edit Transformer that enforces intra-view consistency and inter-view style transfer by utilizing self- and cross-attention, respectively. Since it is no longer required to re-train the model and edit every view in a scene, the editing time, as well as memory resources, are reduced significantly, e.g., the runtime being $\\sim \\textbf{20} \\times$ faster than SOTA. We have conducted extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets and achieve diverse editing capabilities with our proposed technique. "

        "abstract": "Diffusion-based models have demonstrated impressive capabilities for text-to-image generation and are expected for personalized applications of subject-driven generation, which require the generation of customized concepts with one or a few reference images. However, existing methods based on fine-tuning fail to balance the trade-off between subject learning and the maintenance of the generation capabilities of pretrained models. Moreover, other methods that utilize additional image encoders tend to lose important details of the subject due to encoding compression. To address these challenges, we propose DreamTurner, a novel method that injects reference information from coarse to fine to achieve subject-driven image generation more effectively. DreamTurner introduces a subject-encoder for coarse subject identity preservation, where the compressed general subject features are introduced through an attention layer before visual-text cross-attention. We then modify the self-attention layers within pretrained text-to-image models to self-subject-attention layers to refine the details of the target subject. The generated image queries detailed features from both the reference image and itself in self-subject-attention. It is worth emphasizing that self-subject-attention is an effective, elegant, and training-free method for maintaining the detailed features of customized subjects and can serve as a plug-and-play solution during inference. Finally, with additional subject-driven fine-tuning, DreamTurner achieves remarkable performance in subject-driven image generation, which can be controlled by a text or other conditions such as pose.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in offline reinforcement learning (RL) have underscored the capabilities of Return-Conditioned Supervised Learning (RCSL), a paradigm that learns the action distribution based on target returns for each state in a supervised manner. However, prevailing RCSL methods largely focus on deterministic trajectory modeling, disregarding stochastic state transitions and the diversity of future trajectory distributions. A fundamental challenge arises from the inconsistency between the sampled returns within individual trajectories and the expected returns across multiple trajectories. Fortunately, value-based methods offer a solution by leveraging a value function to approximate the expected returns, thereby addressing the inconsistency effectively. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel approach, termed the Critic-Guided Decision Transformer (CGDT), which combines the predictability of long-term returns from value-based methods with the trajectory modeling capability of the Decision Transformer. By incorporating a learned value function, known as the critic, CGDT ensures a direct alignment between the specified target returns and the expected returns of actions. This integration bridges the gap between the deterministic nature of RCSL and the probabilistic characteristics of value-based methods. Empirical evaluations on stochastic environments and D4RL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGDT over traditional RCSL methods. These results highlight the potential of CGDT to advance the state of the art in offline RL and extend the applicability of RCSL to a wide range of RL tasks. "

By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar renders quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. We encode information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and neural network, which takes parameters of Gaussian and viewing direction to produce changes in color and opacity. Consequently, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and transparency of 3D objects. "

In this work, we deliver an in-depth analysis of the behavior across different choices of learning methods from the perspective of both performance and calibration, as well as their interplay. Through extensive controlled experiments, we find that simultaneous gains for both task performance and calibration are difficult to achieve, and the problem of miscalibration exists across all learning methods in low-resource scenarios.To address this challenging trade-off between performance and calibration, we then investigate the potential of self-ensembling techniques applied at different modeling stages (e.g., variations of in-context examples or variations in prompts or different ensembling strategies). We justify the feasibility of self-ensembling on SFT in addition to ICL, to make the predictions more calibrated and have comparable or even better performance.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13866",
        "abstract": "Understanding user intentions is crucial for enhancing product recommendations, navigation suggestions, and query reformulations. However, user intentions can be complex, involving multiple sessions and attribute requirements connected by logical operators such as And, Or, and Not. For example, a user may search for Nike or Adidas running shoes across various sessions, with a preference for the color purple. In another case, a user may have purchased a mattress in a previous session and is now seeking a corresponding bed frame without intending to buy another mattress. Prior research on session understanding has not sufficiently addressed how to make product or attribute recommendations for such complex intentions. In this paper, we introduce the task of logical session complex query answering, where sessions are treated as hyperedges of items, and we formulate the problem of complex intention understanding as a task of logical session complex queries answering (LS-CQA) on an aggregated hypergraph of sessions, items, and attributes. The proposed task is a special type of complex query answering task with sessions as ordered hyperedges. We also propose a new model, the Logical Session Graph Transformer (LSGT), which captures interactions among items across different sessions and their logical connections using a transformer structure. We analyze the expressiveness of LSGT and prove the permutation invariance of the inputs for the logical operators. We evaluate LSGT on three datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results. "

        "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has reached a level of accuracy in recent years, that even outperforms humans in transcribing speech to text. Nevertheless, all current ASR approaches show a certain weakness against ambient noise. To reduce this weakness, audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) approaches additionally consider visual information from lip movements for transcription. This additional modality increases the computational cost for training models from scratch. We propose an approach, that builds on a pre-trained ASR model and extends it with an adaptive upstream module, that fuses audio and visual information. Since we do not need to train the transformer structure from scratch, our approach requires a fraction of the computational resources compared to traditional AVSR models. Compared to current SOTA systems like AV-HuBERT, our approach achieves an average improvement of 8.3% in word error rate across different model sizes, noise categories and broad SNR range. The approach allows up to 21% smaller models and requires only a fraction of the computational resources for training and inference compared to common AVSR approaches. "

        "abstract": "This paper presents Paint3D, a novel coarse-to-fine generative framework that is capable of producing high-resolution, lighting-less, and diverse 2K UV texture maps for untextured 3D meshes conditioned on text or image inputs. The key challenge addressed is generating high-quality textures without embedded illumination information, which allows the textures to be re-lighted or re-edited within modern graphics pipelines. To achieve this, our method first leverages a pre-trained depth-aware 2D diffusion model to generate view-conditional images and perform multi-view texture fusion, producing an initial coarse texture map. However, as 2D models cannot fully represent 3D shapes and disable lighting effects, the coarse texture map exhibits incomplete areas and illumination artifacts. To resolve this, we train separate UV Inpainting and UVHD diffusion models specialized for the shape-aware refinement of incomplete areas and the removal of illumination artifacts. Through this coarse-to-fine process, Paint3D can produce high-quality 2K UV textures that maintain semantic consistency while being lighting-less, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in texturing 3D objects.

Existing methods often rely on time-consuming one-by-one optimization approaches, which are not efficient for modeling the same distribution content, e.g., faces. Additionally, an ideal controllable 3D face generation model should consider both facial attributes and expressions. Thus we propose a novel approach called TEx-Face(TExt & Expression-to-Face) that addresses these challenges by dividing the task into three components, i.e., 3D GAN Inversion, Conditional Style Code Diffusion, and 3D Face Decoding. For 3D GAN inversion, we introduce two methods which aim to enhance the representation of style codes and alleviate 3D inconsistencies. Furthermore, we design a style code denoiser to incorporate multiple conditions into the style code and propose a data augmentation strategy to address the issue of insufficient paired visual-language data. Extensive experiments conducted on FFHQ, CelebA-HQ, and CelebA-Dialog demonstrate the promising performance of our TEx-Face in achieving the efficient and controllable generation of photorealistic 3D faces.

In addition, we fine-tune Typhoon to follow Thai instructions, and we evaluate instruction-tuned models on Thai instruction datasets as well as translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks. Experimental results on a suite of Thai benchmarks show that Typhoon outperforms all open-source Thai language models, and its performance is on par with GPT-3.5 in Thai while having only 7 billion parameters and being 2.62 times more efficient in tokenizing Thai text.

We define human likeness as `not distinguishable from human comments', approximated by the difficulty of automatic classification between human and GPT comments. We analyze human likeness across multiple prompting techniques. In particular, we utilize zero-shot, few-shot and context prompts, for two generated personas. We found that our fine-tuned BERT models can easily distinguish human-written comments from GPT-3.5 generated comments, with none of the used prompting methods performing noticeably better. We further analyzed that human comments consistently showed higher lexical diversity than GPT-generated comments. This indicates that although generative LLMs can generate fluent text, their capability to create human-like opinionated comments is still limited. "

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in the text-to-3D task leverage finetuned text-to-image diffusion models to generate multi-view images, followed by NeRF reconstruction. Yet, existing supervised finetuned (SFT) diffusion models still suffer from multi-view inconsistency and the resulting NeRF artifacts. Although training longer with SFT improves consistency, it also causes distribution shift, which reduces diversity and realistic details. We argue that the SFT of multi-view diffusion models resembles the instruction finetuning stage of the LLM alignment pipeline and can benefit from RL finetuning (RLFT) methods. Essentially, RLFT methods optimize models beyond their SFT data distribution by using their own outputs, effectively mitigating distribution shift. To this end, we introduce Carve3D, a RLFT method coupled with the Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric, to improve the consistency of multi-view diffusion models. To compute MRC on a set of multi-view images, we compare them with their corresponding renderings of the reconstructed NeRF at the same viewpoints. We validate the robustness of MRC with extensive experiments conducted under controlled inconsistency levels. We enhance the base RLFT algorithm to stabilize the training process, reduce distribution shift, and identify scaling laws. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, along with a user study, we demonstrate Carve3D's improved multi-view consistency, the resulting superior NeRF reconstruction quality, and minimal distribution shift compared to longer SFT.

In this work, we study the influence of the TS for well-established or emerging pre-trained embeddings, chosen to represent different types of architectures and learning paradigms. We conduct this evaluation using both musical instrument and environmental sound datasets, namely OpenMIC, TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile, and ESC-50. We especially highlight that Audio Spectrogram Transformer-based systems (PaSST and BEATs) remain effective with smaller TS, which therefore allows for a drastic reduction in memory and computational cost.

To this end, we establish a simple, yet strong model that adopts a Transformer-based architecture with all texts as queries, iteratively attending to the visual features, to infer the optimal timestamp. We conduct thorough experiments to investigate: (i) the effect of upgrading ASR systems to reduce errors from speech recognition, (ii) the effect of various visual-textual backbones, ranging from CLIP to S3D, to the more recent InternVideo, (iii) the effect of transforming noisy ASR transcripts into descriptive steps by prompting a large language model (LLM), to summarize the core activities within the ASR transcript as a new training dataset. As a result, our proposed simple model demonstrates superior performance on both narration alignment and procedural step grounding tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on three public benchmarks, namely, 9.3% on HT-Step, 3.4% on HTM-Align and 4.7% on CrossTask.

While these models are powerful, they have not yet been developed to comprehend the more challenging 3D physical scenes, especially when it comes to the sparse outdoor LiDAR data. In this paper, we introduce LiDAR-LLM, which takes raw LiDAR data as input and harnesses the remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs to gain a comprehensive understanding of outdoor 3D scenes. The central insight of our LiDAR-LLM is the reformulation of 3D outdoor scene cognition as a language modeling problem, encompassing tasks such as 3D captioning, 3D grounding, 3D question answering, etc. Specifically, due to the scarcity of 3D LiDAR-text pairing data, we introduce a three-stage training strategy and generate relevant datasets, progressively aligning the 3D modality with the language embedding space of LLM. Furthermore, we design a View-Aware Transformer (VAT) to connect the 3D encoder with the LLM, which effectively bridges the modality gap and enhances the LLM's spatial orientation comprehension of visual features. Our experiments show that LiDAR-LLM possesses favorable capabilities to comprehend various instructions regarding 3D scenes and engage in complex spatial reasoning.

The phenomenon of sextortion is now widely studied by psychologists, sociologists, criminologists, etc. The findings have been translated into scattered help from NGOs, specialized law enforcement units, and therapists, who usually do not coordinate their efforts among each other. This paper addresses the gap of lacking coordination systems to effectively and efficiently use modern information technologies that align the efforts of scattered and non-aligned sextortion help organizations. Consequently, this paper not only investigates the goals, incentives, and disincentives for a system design and development that not only governs effectively and efficiently diverse cases of sextortion victims, but also leverages artificial intelligence in a targeted manner. It explores how AI and, in particular, autonomous cognitive entities can improve victim profiles analysis, streamline support mechanisms, and provide intelligent insight into sextortion cases.

Therefore, in this paper we introduce HD-Painter, a completely training-free approach that accurately follows to prompts and coherently scales to high-resolution image inpainting. To this end, we design the Prompt-Aware Introverted Attention (PAIntA) layer enhancing self-attention scores by prompt information and resulting in better text alignment generations. To further improve the prompt coherence we introduce the Reweighting Attention Score Guidance (RASG) mechanism seamlessly integrating a post-hoc sampling strategy into general form of DDIM to prevent out-of-distribution latent shifts. Moreover, HD-Painter allows extension to larger scales by introducing a specialized super-resolution technique customized for inpainting, enabling the completion of missing regions in images of up to 2K resolution.

For the first time, we present a suitable representation for 3D diffusion models to enable such disentanglement by introducing a hybrid point cloud and neural radiance field approach. We model a diffusion process over point positions jointly with a high-dimensional feature space for a local density and radiance decoder. While the point positions represent the coarse shape of the object, the point features allow modeling the geometry and appearance details. This disentanglement enables us to sample both independently and therefore to control both separately. Our approach sets a new state of the art in generation compared to previous disentanglement-capable methods by reduced FID scores of 30-90% and is on-par with other non disentanglement-capable state-of-the art methods.

These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain, yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space, which is the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work, we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R, a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections, i.e. operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps, relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided, we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders, allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information, but interestingly, we can seamlessly recover from it, pixel matches, relative and absolute camera. Exhaustive experiments on all these tasks showcase that the proposed DUSt3R can unify various 3D vision tasks and set new SoTAs on monocular/multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13600",
        "abstract": "Decoding spoken speech from neural activity in the brain is a fast-emerging research topic, as it could enable communication for people who have difficulties with producing audible speech. For this task, electrocorticography (ECoG) is a common method for recording brain activity with high temporal resolution and high spatial precision. However, due to the risky surgical procedure required for obtaining ECoG recordings, relatively little of this data has been collected, and the amount is insufficient to train a neural network-based Brain-to-Speech (BTS) system. To address this problem, we propose BrainTalker-a novel BTS framework that generates intelligible spoken speech from ECoG signals under extremely low-resource scenarios. We apply a transfer learning approach utilizing a pre-trained self supervised model, Wav2Vec 2.0. Specifically, we train an encoder module to map ECoG signals to latent embeddings that match Wav2Vec 2.0 representations of the corresponding spoken speech. These embeddings are then transformed into mel-spectrograms using stacked convolutional and transformer-based layers, which are fed into a neural vocoder to synthesize speech waveform. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed framework achieves outstanding performance in terms of subjective and objective metrics, including a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 between generated and ground truth mel spectrograms. We share publicly available Demos and Code. "

        "title": "Style Modeling for Multi-Speaker Articulation-to-Speech",
        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13603",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a neural articulation-to-speech (ATS) framework that synthesizes high-quality speech from articulatory signal in a multi-speaker situation. Most conventional ATS approaches only focus on modeling contextual information of speech from a single speaker's articulatory features. To explicitly represent each speaker's speaking style as well as the contextual information, our proposed model estimates style embeddings, guided from the essential speech style attributes such as pitch and energy. We adopt convolutional layers and transformer-based attention layers for our model to fully utilize both local and global information of articulatory signals, measured by electromagnetic articulography (EMA). Our model significantly improves the quality of synthesized speech compared to the baseline in terms of objective and subjective measurements in the Haskins dataset. "
