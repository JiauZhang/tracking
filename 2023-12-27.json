        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14945",
        "abstract": "Prognostics and health management (PHM) is essential for industrial operation and maintenance, focusing on predicting, diagnosing, and managing the health status of industrial systems. The emergence of the ChatGPT-Like large-scale language model (LLM) has begun to lead a new round of innovation in the AI field. It has extensively promoted the level of intelligence in various fields. Therefore, it is also expected further to change the application paradigm in industrial PHM and promote PHM to become intelligent. Although ChatGPT-Like LLMs have rich knowledge reserves and powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, they lack domain-specific expertise, significantly limiting their practicability in PHM applications. To this end, this study explores the ChatGPT-Like LLM empowered by the local knowledge base (LKB) in industrial PHM to solve the above limitations. In addition, we introduce the method and steps of combining the LKB with LLMs, including LKB preparation, LKB vectorization, prompt engineering, etc. Experimental analysis of real cases shows that combining the LKB with ChatGPT-Like LLM can significantly improve its performance and make ChatGPT-Like LLMs more accurate, relevant, and able to provide more insightful information. This can promote the development of ChatGPT-Like LLMs in industrial PHM and promote their efficiency and quality. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14949",
        "abstract": "With the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, a natural question is the extent to which these models can be utilized for source code optimization. This paper presents methodologically stringent case studies applied to well-known open source python libraries pillow and numpy. We find that contemporary LLM ChatGPT-4 (state September and October 2023) is surprisingly adept at optimizing energy and compute efficiency. However, this is only the case in interactive use, with a human expert in the loop. Aware of experimenter bias, we document our qualitative approach in detail, and provide transcript and source code. We start by providing a detailed description of our approach in conversing with the LLM to optimize the _getextrema function in the pillow library, and a quantitative evaluation of the performance improvement. To demonstrate qualitative replicability, we report further attempts on another locus in the pillow library, and one code locus in the numpy library, to demonstrate generalization within and beyond a library. In all attempts, the performance improvement is significant (factor up to 38). We have also not omitted reporting of failed attempts (there were none). We conclude that LLMs are a promising tool for code optimization in open source libraries, but that the human expert in the loop is essential for success. Nonetheless, we were surprised by how few iterations were required to achieve substantial performance improvements that were not obvious to the expert in the loop. We would like bring attention to the qualitative nature of this study, more robust quantitative studies would need to introduce a layer of selecting experts in a representative sample -- we invite the community to collaborate.

Emerging large language models (LLMs) provide a previously impossible opportunity to automatically translate a task description in a natural language to a program that can be executed by the drone. However, powerful LLMs and their vision counterparts are limited in three important ways. First, they are only available as cloud-based services. Sending images to the cloud raises privacy concerns. Second, they are expensive, costing proportionally to the request size. Finally, without expensive fine-tuning, existing LLMs are quite limited in their capability of writing a program for specialized systems like drones. "

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have garnered significant attention since they can effectively learn complex multivariate Gaussian distributions, resulting in diverse, high-quality outcomes. They introduce Gaussian noise into training data and reconstruct the original data iteratively. Central to this iterative process is a single Unet, adapting across time steps to facilitate generation. Recent work revealed the presence of composition and denoising phases in this generation process, raising questions about the Unets' varying roles. Our study dives into the dynamic behavior of Unets within denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), focusing on (de)convolutional blocks and skip connections across time steps. We propose an analytical method to systematically assess the impact of time steps and core Unet components on the final output. This method eliminates components to study causal relations and investigate their influence on output changes. The main purpose is to understand the temporal dynamics and identify potential shortcuts during inference. Our findings provide valuable insights into the various generation phases during inference and shed light on the Unets' usage patterns across these phases. Leveraging these insights, we identify redundancies in GLIDE (an improved DDPM) and improve inference time by ~27% with minimal degradation in output quality. Our ultimate goal is to guide more informed optimization strategies for inference and influence new model designs. "

Our work advocates moderated usage of such models, designed in a way that supports students and encourages critical thinking. We developed two moderated interaction methods with ChatGPT: hint-based assistance and presenting multiple answer choices. In a study with students (N=40) answering physics questions, we compared the effects of our moderated models against two baseline settings: unmoderated ChatGPT access and internet searches. We analyzed the interaction strategies and found that the moderated versions exhibited less unreflected usage (e.g., copy \\& paste) compared to the unmoderated condition. However, neither ChatGPT-supported condition could match the ratio of reflected usage present in internet searches. Our research highlights the potential benefits of moderating language models, showing a research direction toward designing effective AI-supported educational strategies. "

        "abstract": "Many companies rely on APIs of managed AI models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 to create AI-enabled experiences in their products. Along with the benefits of ease of use and shortened time to production, this reliance on proprietary APIs has downsides in terms of model control, performance reliability, up-time predictability, and cost. At the same time, there has been a flurry of open source small language models (SLMs) that have been made available for commercial use. However, their readiness to replace existing capabilities remains unclear, and a systematic approach to test these models is not readily available. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation methodology for, and characterization of, modern open source SLMs and their trade-offs when replacing a proprietary LLM APIs for a real-world product feature. We have designed SLaM, an automated analysis tool that enables the quantitative and qualitative testing of product features utilizing arbitrary SLMs. Using SLaM, we examine both the quality and the performance characteristics of modern SLMs relative to an existing customer-facing OpenAI-based implementation. We find that across 9 SLMs and 29 variants, we observe competitive quality-of-results for our use case, significant performance consistency improvement, and a cost reduction of 5x-29x when compared to OpenAI GPT-4.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14976",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved great progress in face generation. However, these models amplify the bias in the generation process, leading to an imbalance in distribution of sensitive attributes such as age, gender and race. This paper proposes a novel solution to this problem by balancing the facial attributes of the generated images. We mitigate the bias by localizing the means of the facial attributes in the latent space of the diffusion model using Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Our motivation for choosing GMMs over other clustering frameworks comes from the flexible latent structure of diffusion model. Since each sampling step in diffusion models follows a Gaussian distribution, we show that fitting a GMM model helps us to localize the subspace responsible for generating a specific attribute. Furthermore, our method does not require retraining, we instead localize the subspace on-the-fly and mitigate the bias for generating a fair dataset. We evaluate our approach on multiple face attribute datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results demonstrate that our approach leads to a more fair data generation in terms of representational fairness while preserving the quality of generated samples. "

The reverse operation may then be applied to new random data in order to produce new outputs. We provide a brief introduction to diffusion models for applied mathematicians and statisticians. Our key aims are (a) to present illustrative computational examples, (b) to give a careful derivation of the underlying mathematical formulas involved, and (c) to draw a connection with partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion models. We provide code for the computational experiments. We hope that this topic will be of interest to advanced undergraduate students and postgraduate students.

Our model, named TPTNet uses only 2m temperature measured at the weather stations of the South Korean Peninsula as input to predict the local temperature at finite forecast hours. The turbulent fluctuation component of the temperature was extracted from the station measurements by separating the climatology component accounting for the yearly and daily variations. The effect of station altitude was then compensated by introducing a potential temperature. The resulting turbulent potential temperature data at irregularly distributed stations were used as input for predicting the turbulent potential temperature at forecast hours through three trained networks based on convolutional neural network (CNN), Swin Transformer, and a graphic neural network (GNN). The prediction performance of our network was compared with that of persistence and NWP, confirming that our model outperformed NWP for up to 12 forecast hours. "

In this work, we explore non-autoregressive text-to-image models that efficiently generate hundreds of image tokens in parallel. We develop many model variations with different learning and inference strategies, initialized text encoders, etc. Compared with autoregressive baselines that needs to run one thousand times, our model only runs 16 times to generate images of competitive quality with an order of magnitude lower inference latency.

Our investigation focuses on paintings by Vincent van Gogh, for which we release the first dataset specialized for forgery detection. To reinforce our results, we conduct the same analyses on the artists Amedeo Modigliani and Raphael. We train a classifier to distinguish original artworks from forgeries. For this, we use human-made forgeries and imitations in the style of well-known artists and augment our training sets with images in a similar style generated by Stable Diffusion and StyleGAN. We find that the additional synthetic forgeries consistently improve the detection of human-made forgeries. In addition, we find that, in line with previous research, the inclusion of synthetic forgeries in the training also enables the detection of AI-generated forgeries, especially if created using a similar generator.

Some prior works even train classifiers to be invariant to the background, completely discarding the living environment of birds. Instead, we are the first to explore integrating habitat information, one of the four major cues for identifying birds by ornithologists, into modern bird classifiers. We focus on two leading model types: (1) CNNs and ViTs trained on the downstream bird datasets; and (2) original, multi-modal CLIP. Training CNNs and ViTs with habitat-augmented data results in an improvement of up to +0.83 and +0.23 points on NABirds and CUB-200, respectively. Similarly, adding habitat descriptors to the prompts for CLIP yields a substantial accuracy boost of up to +0.99 and +1.1 points on NABirds and CUB-200, respectively. We find consistent accuracy improvement after integrating habitat features into the image augmentation process and into the textual descriptors of vision-language CLIP classifiers.

        "abstract": "Text-driven motion generation has achieved substantial progress with the emergence of diffusion models. However, existing methods still struggle to generate complex motion sequences that correspond to fine-grained descriptions, depicting detailed and accurate spatio-temporal actions. This lack of fine controllability limits the usage of motion generation to a larger audience. To tackle these challenges, we present FineMoGen, a diffusion-based motion generation and editing framework that can synthesize fine-grained motions, with spatial-temporal composition to the user instructions. Specifically, FineMoGen builds upon diffusion model with a novel transformer architecture dubbed Spatio-Temporal Mixture Attention (SAMI). SAMI optimizes the generation of the global attention template from two perspectives: 1) explicitly modeling the constraints of spatio-temporal composition; and 2) utilizing sparsely-activated mixture-of-experts to adaptively extract fine-grained features. To facilitate a large-scale study on this new fine-grained motion generation task, we contribute the HuMMan-MoGen dataset, which consists of 2,968 videos and 102,336 fine-grained spatio-temporal descriptions. Extensive experiments validate that FineMoGen exhibits superior motion generation quality over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, FineMoGen further enables zero-shot motion editing capabilities with the aid of modern large language models (LLM), which faithfully manipulates motion sequences with fine-grained instructions.

In response, we propose a novel methodology anchored in sparsity-guided techniques, aiming to provide a holistic interpretation of LLMs. Our framework, termed SparseCBM, innovatively integrates sparsity to elucidate three intertwined layers of interpretation: input, subnetwork, and concept levels. In addition, the newly introduced dimension of interpretable inference-time intervention facilitates dynamic adjustments to the model during deployment. Through rigorous empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SparseCBM delivers a profound understanding of LLM behaviors, setting it apart in both interpreting and ameliorating model inaccuracies.

        "abstract": "One goal of technical online communities is to help developers find the right answer in one place. A single question can be asked in different ways with different wordings, leading to the existence of duplicate posts on technical forums. The question of how to discover and link duplicate posts has garnered the attention of both developer communities and researchers. For example, Stack Overflow adopts a voting-based mechanism to mark and close duplicate posts. However, addressing these constantly emerging duplicate posts in a timely manner continues to pose challenges. Therefore, various approaches have been proposed to detect duplicate posts on technical forum posts automatically. The existing methods suffer from limitations either due to their reliance on handcrafted similarity metrics which can not sufficiently capture the semantics of posts, or their lack of supervision to improve the performance. Additionally, the efficiency of these methods is hindered by their dependence on pair-wise feature generation, which can be impractical for large amount of data. In this work, we attempt to employ and refine the GPT-3 embeddings for the duplicate detection task. We assume that the GPT-3 embeddings can accurately represent the semantics of the posts. In addition, by training a Siamese-based network based on the GPT-3 embeddings, we obtain a latent embedding that accurately captures the duplicate relation in technical forum posts. Our experiment on a benchmark dataset confirms the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods. When applied to the dataset we constructed with a recent Stack Overflow dump, our approach attains a Top-1, Top-5, and Top-30 accuracy of 23.1%, 43.9%, and 68.9%, respectively. With a manual study, we confirm our approach's potential of finding unlabelled duplicates on technical forums. "

        "abstract": "Tooth arrangement is a crucial step in orthodontics treatment, in which aligning teeth could improve overall well-being, enhance facial aesthetics, and boost self-confidence. To improve the efficiency of tooth arrangement and minimize errors associated with unreasonable designs by inexperienced practitioners, some deep learning-based tooth arrangement methods have been proposed. Currently, most existing approaches employ MLPs to model the nonlinear relationship between tooth features and transformation matrices to achieve tooth arrangement automatically. However, the limited datasets (which to our knowledge, have not been made public) collected from clinical practice constrain the applicability of existing methods, making them inadequate for addressing diverse malocclusion issues. To address this challenge, we propose a general tooth arrangement neural network based on the diffusion probabilistic model. Conditioned on the features extracted from the dental model, the diffusion probabilistic model can learn the distribution of teeth transformation matrices from malocclusion to normal occlusion by gradually denoising from a random variable, thus more adeptly managing real orthodontic data. To take full advantage of effective features, we exploit both mesh and point cloud representations by designing different encoding networks to extract the tooth (local) and jaw (global) features, respectively. In addition to traditional metrics ADD, PA-ADD, CSA, and ME_{rot}, we propose a new evaluation metric based on dental arch curves to judge whether the generated teeth meet the individual normal occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art tooth alignment results and satisfactory occlusal relationships between dental arches.

Consider an undirected graph where each node has a strict linear order over a set of $\\alpha$ alternatives. At each round, a node randomly selects two adjacent alternatives and updates their relative order with the majority view of its neighbors. We bound the convergence time of the process in terms of the number of nodes/edges and $\\alpha$. Furthermore, we study the minimum cost to ensure that a desired alternative will ``win'' the process, where occupying each position in a preference order of a node has a cost. We prove tight bounds on the minimum cost for general graphs and graphs with strong expansion properties. Furthermore, we investigate a more light-weight process where each node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random and copies its order fully with some fixed probability and remains unchanged otherwise. We characterize the convergence properties of this process, namely convergence time and stable states, using Martingale and reversible Markov chain analysis. Finally, we present the outcomes of our experiments conducted on different synthetic random graph models and graph data from online social platforms. These experiments not only support our theoretical findings, but also shed some light on some other fundamental problems, such as designing powerful countermeasures. "

        "abstract": "Programmers often search for usage examples for API methods. A tool that could generate realistic, idiomatic, and contextual usage examples for one or more APIs would be immensely beneficial to developers. Such a tool would relieve the need for a deep understanding of the API landscape, augment existing documentation, and help discover interactions among APIs. We present CodeScholar, a tool that generates idiomatic code examples demonstrating the common usage of API methods. It includes a novel neural-guided search technique over graphs that grows the query APIs into idiomatic code examples. Our user study demonstrates that in 70% of cases, developers prefer CodeScholar generated examples over state-of-the-art large language models (LLM) like GPT3.5. We quantitatively evaluate 60 single and 25 multi-API queries from 6 popular Python libraries and show that across-the-board CodeScholar generates more realistic, diverse, and concise examples. In addition, we show that CodeScholar not only helps developers but also LLM-powered programming assistants generate correct code in a program synthesis setting. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15159",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) boasting billions of parameters have generated a significant demand for efficient deployment in inference workloads. The majority of existing approaches rely on temporal architectures that reuse hardware units for different network layers and operators. However, these methods often encounter challenges in achieving low latency due to considerable memory access overhead. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM inference on FPGAs. Our approach involves the specialization of distinct hardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct communication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing off-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for estimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account the on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. Through our analysis, we can determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial acceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart. To enable more productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable. This library will be made available as open-source. To validate the effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented BERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 16.1x speedup when compared to previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative inference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the prefill stage, while achieving a 1.9x speedup and a 5.7x improvement in energy efficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.

MeZO fine-tunes the large language models (LLMs) by just forward passes in a zeroth-order SGD optimizer (ZO-SGD), demonstrating excellent performance with the same GPU memory usage as inference. However, the simulated perturbation stochastic approximation for gradient estimate in MeZO leads to severe oscillations and incurs a substantial time overhead. Moreover, without momentum regularization, MeZO shows severe over-fitting problems. Lastly, the perturbation-irrelevant momentum on ZO-SGD does not improve the convergence rate. This study proposes ZO-AdaMU to resolve the above problems by adapting the simulated perturbation with momentum in its stochastic approximation. Unlike existing adaptive momentum methods, we relocate momentum on simulated perturbation in stochastic gradient approximation. Our convergence analysis and experiments prove this is a better way to improve convergence stability and rate in ZO-SGD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZO-AdaMU yields better generalization for LLMs fine-tuning across various NLP tasks than MeZO and its momentum variants. "

        "abstract": "Multi-hop question answering (MQA) is one of the challenging tasks to evaluate machine's comprehension and reasoning abilities, where large language models (LLMs) have widely achieved the human-comparable performance. Due to the dynamics of knowledge facts in real world, knowledge editing has been explored to update model with the up-to-date facts while avoiding expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Starting from the edited fact, the updated model needs to provide cascading changes in the chain of MQA. The previous art simply adopts a mix-up prompt to instruct LLMs conducting multiple reasoning tasks sequentially, including question decomposition, answer generation, and conflict checking via comparing with edited facts. However, the coupling of these functionally-diverse reasoning tasks inhibits LLMs' advantages in comprehending and answering questions while disturbing them with the unskilled task of conflict checking. We thus propose a framework, Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering (PokeMQA), to decouple the jobs. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to decompose knowledge-augmented multi-hop question, while interacting with a detached trainable scope detector to modulate LLMs behavior depending on external conflict signal. The experiments on three LLM backbones and two benchmark datasets validate our superiority in knowledge editing of MQA, outperforming all competitors by a large margin in almost all settings and consistently producing reliable reasoning process.

Recent social science research has explored the use of these \"black-box\" LLM agents for simulating complex social systems and potentially substituting human subjects in experiments. Our study delves into this emerging domain, investigating the extent to which LLMs exhibit key social interaction principles, such as social learning, social preference, and cooperative behavior, in their interactions with humans and other agents. We develop a novel framework for our study, wherein classical laboratory experiments involving human subjects are adapted to use LLM agents. This approach involves step-by-step reasoning that mirrors human cognitive processes and zero-shot learning to assess the innate preferences of LLMs. Our analysis of LLM agents' behavior includes both the primary effects and an in-depth examination of the underlying mechanisms. Focusing on GPT-4, the state-of-the-art LLM, our analyses suggest that LLM agents appear to exhibit a range of human-like social behaviors such as distributional and reciprocity preferences, responsiveness to group identity cues, engagement in indirect reciprocity, and social learning capabilities. However, our analysis also reveals notable differences: LLMs demonstrate a pronounced fairness preference, weaker positive reciprocity, and a more calculating approach in social learning compared to humans. These insights indicate that while LLMs hold great promise for applications in social science research, such as in laboratory experiments and agent-based modeling, the subtle behavioral differences between LLM agents and humans warrant further investigation. Careful examination and development of protocols in evaluating the social behaviors of LLMs are necessary before directly applying these models to emulate human behavior. "

However, their effectiveness depends on the quality of the pre-training dataset, particularly the human reference comments, which serve as a bridge between the programming language and natural language. One significant challenge is that such comments can become inconsistent with the corresponding code as the software evolves. This discrepancy can lead to suboptimal training of the models, decreasing their performances. LLMs have demonstrated superior capabilities in generating high-quality code comments. In light of that, we try to tackle the quality issue of the dataset by harnessing the power of LLMs. Specifically, we raise the question: Can we rebuild the pre-training dataset by substituting the original comments with LLM-generated ones for more effective pre-trained code models? To answer the question, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation to compare ChatGPT-generated comments with human reference comments. As existing reference-based metrics treat the reference comments as gold standards, we introduce two auxiliary tasks as novel reference-free metrics to assess the quality of comments, i.e., code-comment inconsistency detection and code search. Experimental results show that ChatGPT-generated comments demonstrate superior semantic consistency with the code compared to human references, indicating the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance the quality of the pre-training dataset. We rebuilt the widely used dataset, CodeSearchNet, with ChatGPT-generated comments. Subsequent experiments involve re-pre-training the CodeT5 with our refined dataset.Evaluation results on four generation tasks and one understanding code intelligence tasks show that the model pre-trained by ChatGPT-enhanced data outperforms its counterpart on code summarization, code generation, and code translation tasks.

        "abstract": "AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances, enabling them to assist humans in diverse complex tasks and leading to a revolution in human-AI coordination. LLM-powered agents typically require invoking LLM APIs and employing artificially designed complex prompts, which results in high inference latency. While this paradigm works well in scenarios with minimal interactive demands, such as code generation, it is unsuitable for highly interactive and real-time applications, such as gaming. Traditional gaming AI often employs small models or reactive policies, enabling fast inference but offering limited task completion and interaction abilities. In this work, we consider Overcooked as our testbed where players could communicate with natural language and cooperate to serve orders. We propose a Hierarchical Language Agent (HLA) for human-AI coordination that provides both strong reasoning abilities while keeping real-time execution. In particular, HLA adopts a hierarchical framework and comprises three modules: a proficient LLM, referred to as Slow Mind, for intention reasoning and language interaction, a lightweight LLM, referred to as Fast Mind, for generating macro actions, and a reactive policy, referred to as Executor, for transforming macro actions into atomic actions. Human studies show that HLA outperforms other baseline agents, including slow-mind-only agents and fast-mind-only agents, with stronger cooperation abilities, faster responses, and more consistent language communications.

        "abstract": "Neural Networks can be efficiently compressed through pruning, significantly reducing storage and computational demands while maintaining predictive performance. Simple yet effective methods like Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP, Han et al., 2015) remove less important parameters and require a costly retraining procedure to recover performance after pruning. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. In this study, we challenge the practice of retraining all parameters by demonstrating that updating only a small subset of highly expressive parameters is often sufficient to recover or even improve performance compared to full retraining. Surprisingly, retraining as little as 0.27%-0.35% of the parameters of GPT-architectures (OPT-2.7B/6.7B/13B/30B) achieves comparable performance to One Shot IMP across various sparsity levels. Our method, Parameter-Efficient Retraining after Pruning (PERP), drastically reduces compute and memory demands, enabling pruning and retraining of up to 30 billion parameter models on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within minutes. Despite magnitude pruning being considered as unsuited for pruning LLMs, our findings show that PERP positions it as a strong contender against state-of-the-art retraining-free approaches such as Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), opening up a promising alternative to avoiding retraining.

        "abstract": "Stock price forecasting has remained an extremely challenging problem for many decades due to the high volatility of the stock market. Recent efforts have been devoted to modeling complex stock correlations toward joint stock price forecasting. Existing works share a common neural architecture that learns temporal patterns from individual stock series and then mixes up temporal representations to establish stock correlations. However, they only consider time-aligned stock correlations stemming from all the input stock features, which suffer from two limitations. First, stock correlations often occur momentarily and in a cross-time manner. Second, the feature effectiveness is dynamic with market variation, which affects both the stock sequential patterns and their correlations. To address the limitations, this paper introduces MASTER, a MArkert-Guided Stock TransformER, which models the momentary and cross-time stock correlation and leverages market information for automatic feature selection. MASTER elegantly tackles the complex stock correlation by alternatively engaging in intra-stock and inter-stock information aggregation. Experiments show the superiority of MASTER compared with previous works and visualize the captured realistic stock correlation to provide valuable insights. "

Doing so not only simplifies the localization process -- by avoiding an outside-the-NeRF-based localization -- but also has the potential to offer the benefit of enhanced localization. This paper studies the problem of localizing cameras in NeRF using a diffusion model for camera pose adjustment. More specifically, given a pre-trained NeRF model, we train a diffusion model that iteratively updates randomly initialized camera poses, conditioned upon the image to be localized. At test time, a new camera is localized in two steps: first, coarse localization using the proposed pose diffusion process, followed by local refinement steps of a pose inversion process in NeRF. In fact, the proposed camera localization by pose diffusion (CaLDiff) method also integrates the pose inversion steps within the diffusion process. Such integration offers significantly better localization, thanks to our downstream refinement-aware diffusion process. Our exhaustive experiments on challenging real-world data validate our method by providing significantly better results than the compared methods and the established baselines. Our source code will be made publicly available. "

Existing methods either compromise on rendering quality or are excessively computationally intensive, often demanding dozens of hours to perform, which significantly hinders their practical application. In this paper, we introduce Fast Orthogonal Plane (Forplane), a novel, efficient framework based on neural radiance fields (NeRF) for the reconstruction of deformable tissues. We conceptualize surgical procedures as 4D volumes, and break them down into static and dynamic fields comprised of orthogonal neural planes. This factorization iscretizes the four-dimensional space, leading to a decreased memory usage and faster optimization. A spatiotemporal importance sampling scheme is introduced to improve performance in regions with tool occlusion as well as large motions and accelerate training. An efficient ray marching method is applied to skip sampling among empty regions, significantly improving inference speed. Forplane accommodates both binocular and monocular endoscopy videos, demonstrating its extensive applicability and flexibility. Our experiments, carried out on two in vivo datasets, the EndoNeRF and Hamlyn datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. In all cases, Forplane substantially accelerates both the optimization process (by over 100 times) and the inference process (by over 15 times) while maintaining or even improving the quality across a variety of non-rigid deformations. This significant performance improvement promises to be a valuable asset for future intraoperative surgical applications.

We therefore propose Paralinguistics-enhanced Generative Pretrained Transformer (ParalinGPT), an LLM utilizes text and speech modality to better model the linguistic content and paralinguistic attribute of spoken response. The model takes the conversational context of text, speech embeddings, and paralinguistic attributes as input prompts within a serialized multitasking multi-modal framework. Specifically, our framework serializes tasks in the order of current paralinguistic attribute prediction, response paralinguistic attribute prediction, and response text generation with autoregressive conditioning. We utilize the Switchboard-1 corpus, including its sentiment labels to be the paralinguistic attribute, as our spoken dialogue dataset. Experimental results indicate the proposed serialized multitasking method outperforms typical sequence classification techniques on current and response sentiment classification. Furthermore, leveraging conversational context and speech embeddings significantly improves both response text generation and sentiment prediction.

This research pioneers an innovative approach harnessing channel state information (CSI) measured from WiFi signals, subtly influenced by the activity of robotic arms.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel on new tasks without additional training, simply by providing natural language prompts that demonstrate how the task should be performed. Prompt ensemble methods comprehensively harness the knowledge of LLMs while mitigating individual biases and errors and further enhancing performance. However, more prompts do not necessarily lead to better results, and not all prompts are beneficial. A small number of high-quality prompts often outperform many low-quality prompts. Currently, there is a lack of a suitable method for evaluating the impact of prompts on the results. In this paper, we utilize the Shapley value to fairly quantify the contributions of prompts, helping to identify beneficial or detrimental prompts, and potentially guiding prompt valuation in data markets. Through extensive experiments employing various ensemble methods and utility functions on diverse tasks, we validate the effectiveness of using the Shapley value method for prompts as it effectively distinguishes and quantifies the contributions of each prompt.

        "abstract": "The increasing size of large language models (LLMs) has introduced challenges in their training and inference. Removing model components is perceived as a solution to tackle the large model sizes, however, existing pruning methods solely focus on performance, without considering an essential aspect for the responsible use of LLMs: model fairness. It is crucial to address the fairness of LLMs towards diverse groups, such as women, Black people, LGBTQ+, Jewish communities, among others, as they are being deployed and available to a wide audience. In this work, first, we investigate how attention heads impact fairness and performance in pre-trained transformer-based language models. We then propose a novel method to prune the attention heads that negatively impact fairness while retaining the heads critical for performance, i.e. language modeling capabilities. Our approach is practical in terms of time and resources, as it does not require fine-tuning the final pruned, and fairer, model. Our findings demonstrate a reduction in gender bias by 19%, 19.5%, 39.5%, 34.7%, 23%, and 8% for DistilGPT-2, GPT-2, GPT-Neo of two different sizes, GPT-J, and Llama 2 models, respectively, in comparison to the biased model, with only a slight decrease in performance.

Consequently, recent studies have suggested various unique, reference-free neural metrics that better align with human evaluations. Notably among them, large language models (LLMs), particularly the instruction-tuned variants like ChatGPT, are shown to be promising substitutes for human judges. Yet, existing works on utilizing LLMs for automatic dialogue evaluation are limited in their scope in terms of the number of meta-evaluation datasets, mode of evaluation, coverage of LLMs, etc. Hence, it remains inconclusive how effective these LLMs are. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on the application of LLMs for automatic dialogue evaluation. Specifically, we analyze the multi-dimensional evaluation capability of 30 recently emerged LLMs at both turn and dialogue levels, using a comprehensive set of 12 meta-evaluation datasets. Additionally, we probe the robustness of the LLMs in handling various adversarial perturbations at both turn and dialogue levels. Finally, we explore how model-level and dimension-level ensembles impact the evaluation performance. All resources are available at https://github.com/e0397123/comp-analysis. "

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide exceptional spatial and spectral resolution of a scene, crucial for various remote sensing applications. However, the high dimensionality, presence of noise and outliers, and the need for precise labels of HSIs present significant challenges to HSIs analysis, motivating the development of performant HSI clustering algorithms. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised HSI clustering algorithm, Superpixel-based and Spatially-regularized Diffusion Learning (S2DL), which addresses these challenges by incorporating rich spatial information encoded in HSIs into diffusion geometry-based clustering. S2DL employs the Entropy Rate Superpixel (ERS) segmentation technique to partition an image into superpixels, then constructs a spatially-regularized diffusion graph using the most representative high-density pixels. This approach reduces computational burden while preserving accuracy. Cluster modes, serving as exemplars for underlying cluster structure, are identified as the highest-density pixels farthest in diffusion distance from other highest-density pixels. These modes guide the labeling of the remaining representative pixels from ERS superpixels. Finally, majority voting is applied to the labels assigned within each superpixel to propagate labels to the rest of the image. This spatial-spectral approach simultaneously simplifies graph construction, reduces computational cost, and improves clustering performance. S2DL's performance is illustrated with extensive experiments on three publicly available, real-world HSIs: Indian Pines, Salinas, and Salinas A. Additionally, we apply S2DL to landscape-scale, unsupervised mangrove species mapping in the Mai Po Nature Reserve, Hong Kong, using a Gaofen-5 HSI. The success of S2DL in these diverse numerical experiments indicates its efficacy on a wide range of important unsupervised remote sensing analysis tasks. "

        "abstract": "Search engines are crucial as they provide an efficient and easy way to access vast amounts of information on the internet for diverse information needs. User queries, even with a specific need, can differ significantly. Prior research has explored the resilience of ranking models against typical query variations like paraphrasing, misspellings, and order changes. Yet, these works overlook how diverse demographics uniquely formulate identical queries. For instance, older individuals tend to construct queries more naturally and in varied order compared to other groups. This demographic diversity necessitates enhancing the adaptability of ranking models to diverse query formulations. To this end, in this paper, we propose a framework that integrates a novel rewriting pipeline that rewrites queries from various demographic perspectives and a novel framework to enhance ranking robustness. To be specific, we use Chain of Thought (CoT) technology to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to emulate various demographic profiles, then use them for efficient query rewriting, and we innovate a robust Multi-gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) architecture coupled with a hybrid loss function, collectively strengthening the ranking models' robustness. Our extensive experimentation on both public and industrial datasets assesses the efficacy of our query rewriting approach and the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the ranking model. The findings highlight the sophistication and effectiveness of our proposed model. "

In this paper, we propose evaluating LLM biases from a group fairness lens using a novel hierarchical schema characterizing diverse social groups. Specifically, we construct a dataset, GFair, encapsulating target-attribute combinations across multiple dimensions. In addition, we introduce statement organization, a new open-ended text generation task, to uncover complex biases in LLMs. Extensive evaluations of popular LLMs reveal inherent safety concerns. To mitigate the biases of LLM from a group fairness perspective, we pioneer a novel chain-of-thought method GF-Think to mitigate biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective.

However, the model can just generate inaccurate images with the guidance of text, which makes it very challenging to directly apply the text-guided generative model for virtual try-on scenarios. Taking images as guiding conditions of the diffusion model, this paper proposes a brand new personalized virtual try-on model (PE-VITON), which uses the two stages (shape control and texture guidance) to decouple the clothing attributes. Specifically, the proposed model adaptively matches the clothing to human body parts through the Shape Control Module (SCM) to mitigate the misalignment of the clothing and the human body parts. The semantic information of the input clothing is parsed by the Texture Guided Module (TGM), and the corresponding texture is generated by directional guidance. Therefore, this model can effectively solve the problems of weak reduction of clothing folds, poor generation effect under complex human posture, blurred edges of clothing, and unclear texture styles in traditional try-on methods. Meanwhile, the model can automatically enhance the generated clothing folds and textures according to the human posture, and improve the authenticity of virtual try-on. In this paper, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out on high-resolution paired and unpaired datasets, the results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model.

Although there have been some attempts to reduce sampling steps, model distillation, and network quantization, these previous methods generally retain the original network architecture. Billion scale parameters and high computing requirements make the research of model architecture adjustment scarce. In this work, we first explore the computational redundancy part of the network, and then prune the redundancy blocks of the model and maintain the network performance through a progressive incubation strategy. Secondly, in order to maintaining the model performance, we add cross-layer multi-expert conditional convolution (CLME-Condconv) to the block pruning part to inherit the original convolution parameters. Thirdly, we propose a global-regional interactive (GRI) attention to speed up the computationally intensive attention part. Finally, we use semantic-aware supervision (SAS) to align the outputs of the teacher model and student model at the semantic level. Experiments show that this method can effectively train a lightweight model close to the performance of the original SD model, and effectively improve the model speed under limited resources.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential to simulate human behavior. Using a causal inference framework, we empirically and theoretically analyze the challenges of conducting LLM-simulated experiments, and explore potential solutions. In the context of demand estimation, we show that variations in the treatment included in the prompt (e.g., price of focal product) can cause variations in unspecified confounding factors (e.g., price of competitors, historical prices, outside temperature), introducing endogeneity and yielding implausibly flat demand curves. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting this endogeneity issue generalizes to other contexts and won't be fully resolved by merely improving the training data. Unlike real experiments where researchers assign pre-existing units across conditions, LLMs simulate units based on the entire prompt, which includes the description of the treatment. Therefore, due to associations in the training data, the characteristics of individuals and environments simulated by the LLM can be affected by the treatment assignment. We explore two potential solutions. The first specifies all contextual variables that affect both treatment and outcome, which we demonstrate to be challenging for a general-purpose LLM. The second explicitly specifies the source of treatment variation in the prompt given to the LLM (e.g., by informing the LLM that the store is running an experiment). While this approach only allows the estimation of a conditional average treatment effect that depends on the specific experimental design, it provides valuable directional results for exploratory analysis.

Our method involves thinking outside the box, literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pre-trained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias, which tends to regenerate similar occluders, and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part? It doesn't require any special training or fine-tuning of models. "

        "abstract": "Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task of Biomedical Natural Language Processing for extracting relevant information from biomedical texts, such as clinical records, scientific publications, and electronic health records. The conventional approaches for biomedical NER mainly use traditional machine learning techniques, such as Conditional Random Fields and Support Vector Machines or deep learning-based models like Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. Recently, Transformer-based models, including BERT, have been used in the domain of biomedical NER and have demonstrated remarkable results. However, these models are often based on word-level embeddings, limiting their ability to capture character-level information, which is effective in biomedical NER due to the high variability and complexity of biomedical texts. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates the strengths of multiple models. In this paper, we proposed an approach that leverages fine-tuned BERT to provide contextualized word embeddings, a pre-trained multi-channel CNN for character-level information capture, and following by a BiLSTM + CRF for sequence labelling and modelling dependencies between the words in the text. In addition, also we propose an enhanced labelling method as part of pre-processing to enhance the identification of the entity's beginning word and thus improve the identification of multi-word entities, a common challenge in biomedical NER. By integrating these models and the pre-processing method, our proposed model effectively captures both contextual information and detailed character-level information. We evaluated our model on the benchmark i2b2/2010 dataset, achieving an F1-score of 90.11. These results illustrate the proficiency of our proposed model in performing biomedical Named Entity Recognition. "

We present an efficient computational method to study fluid flow and solute transport problems in periodic porous media. Fluid flow is governed by the Stokes equation, and the solute transport is governed by the advection-diffusion equation. We follow the accelerated computational micromechanics approach that leads to an iterative computational method where each step is either local or the solution of a Poisson's equation. This enables us to implement these methods on accelerators like graphics processing units (GPUs) and exploit their massively parallel architecture. We verify the approach by comparing the results against established computational methods and then demonstrate the accuracy, efficacy, and performance by studying various examples. This method efficiently calculates the effective transport properties for complex pore geometries. "

To alleviate these challenges, we introduce a novel algorithm, Variational Autoencoder-based Subgoal Inference (VAESI), to accomplish long-horizon tasks through a divide-and-conquer manner. VAESI consists of three components: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based Subgoal Generator, a Hindsight Sampler, and a Value Selector. The VAE-based Subgoal Generator draws inspiration from the human capacity to infer subgoals and reason about the final goal in the context of these subgoals. It is composed of an explicit encoder model, engineered to generate subgoals, and an implicit decoder model, designed to enhance the quality of the generated subgoals by predicting the final goal. Additionally, the Hindsight Sampler selects valid subgoals from an offline dataset to enhance the feasibility of the generated subgoals. The Value Selector utilizes the value function in reinforcement learning to filter the optimal subgoals from subgoal candidates. To validate our method, we conduct several long-horizon tasks in both simulation and the real world, including one locomotion task and three manipulation tasks.

Multimodal neural architecture search (MNAS) is a more efficient approach. However, current MNAS methods, while effective in integrating multi-level information, are incapable of simultaneously searching for optimal operations to extract modality-specific information. This weakens the robustness of the model in addressing diverse scenarios. Moreover, these methods also fall short in enhancing the capture of emotional cues.

However, the challenges of practically deploying LLM4Rec are largely unexplored, with the need for incremental adaptation to evolving user preferences being a critical concern. Nevertheless, the suitability of traditional incremental learning within LLM4Rec remains ambiguous, given the unique characteristics of LLMs. In this study, we empirically evaluate the commonly used incremental learning strategies (full retraining and fine-tuning) for LLM4Rec. Surprisingly, neither approach leads to evident improvements in LLM4Rec's performance. Rather than directly dismissing the role of incremental learning, we ascribe this lack of anticipated performance improvement to the mismatch between the LLM4Recarchitecture and incremental learning: LLM4Rec employs a single adaptation module for learning recommendation, hampering its ability to simultaneously capture long-term and short-term user preferences in the incremental learning context. To validate this speculation, we develop a Long- and Short-term Adaptation-aware Tuning (LSAT) framework for LLM4Rec incremental learning. Instead of relying on a single adaptation module, LSAT utilizes two adaptation modules to separately learn long-term and short-term user preferences. Empirical results demonstrate that LSAT could enhance performance, validating our speculation. "

Past works relating to animals have primarily focused on either animal tracking or single-frame animal pose estimation only, neglecting the integration of both aspects. The absence of comprehensive APT datasets inhibits the progression and evaluation of animal pose estimation and tracking methods based on videos, thereby constraining their real-world applications. To fill this gap, we introduce APTv2, the pioneering large-scale benchmark for animal pose estimation and tracking. APTv2 comprises 2,749 video clips filtered and collected from 30 distinct animal species. Each video clip includes 15 frames, culminating in a total of 41,235 frames. Following meticulous manual annotation and stringent verification, we provide high-quality keypoint and tracking annotations for a total of 84,611 animal instances, split into easy and hard subsets based on the number of instances that exists in the frame. With APTv2 as the foundation, we establish a simple baseline method named \\posetrackmethodname and provide benchmarks for representative models across three tracks: (1) single-frame animal pose estimation track to evaluate both intra- and inter-domain transfer learning performance, (2) low-data transfer and generalization track to evaluate the inter-species domain generalization performance, and (3) animal pose tracking track.

Generally, training a commercially viable neural network requires significant amounts of data and computing resources, and it is easy for unauthorized users to use the networks illegally. Therefore, network ownership verification has become one of the most crucial steps in safeguarding digital assets. To verify the ownership of networks, the existing network fingerprinting approaches perform poorly in the aspects of efficiency, stealthiness, and discriminability. To address these issues, we propose a network fingerprinting approach, named as GanFinger, to construct the network fingerprints based on the network behavior, which is characterized by network outputs of pairs of original examples and conferrable adversarial examples. Specifically, GanFinger leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively generate conferrable adversarial examples with imperceptible perturbations. These examples can exhibit identical outputs on copyrighted and pirated networks while producing different results on irrelevant networks. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of fingerprint ownership verification, the network similarity is computed based on the accuracy-robustness distance of fingerprint examples'outputs. To evaluate the performance of GanFinger, we construct a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 186 networks with five network structures and four popular network post-processing techniques. The benchmark experiments demonstrate that GanFinger significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in efficiency, stealthiness, and discriminability. It achieves a remarkable 6.57 times faster in fingerprint generation and boosts the ARUC value by 0.175, resulting in a relative improvement of about 26%. "

With the aim of achieving efficient compression, we propose the layer-wise scalable entropy transformer to reduce the redundancy between layers. Based on the multi-task scalable rate-distortion objective, the proposed scheme is jointly optimized to achieve optimal machine analysis performance, human perception experience, and compression ratio. We validate the proposed paradigm's feasibility in face image compression. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed paradigm over the latest compression standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in terms of both machine analysis as well as human perception at extremely low bitrates ($<0.01$ bpp), offering new insights for human-machine collaborative compression.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15628",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated promising results in text-to-audio generation tasks. However, their practical usability is hindered by slow sampling speeds, limiting their applicability in high-throughput scenarios. To address this challenge, progressive distillation methods have been effective in producing more compact and efficient models. Nevertheless, these methods encounter issues with unbalanced weights at both high and low noise levels, potentially impacting the quality of generated samples. In this paper, we propose the adaptation of the progressive distillation method to text-to-audio generation tasks and introduce the Balanced SNR-Aware~(BSA) method, an enhanced loss-weighting mechanism for diffusion distillation. The BSA method employs a balanced approach to weight the loss for both high and low noise levels. We evaluate our proposed method on the AudioCaps dataset and report experimental results showing superior performance during the reverse diffusion process compared to previous distillation methods with the same number of sampling steps. Furthermore, the BSA method allows for a significant reduction in sampling steps from 200 to 25, with minimal performance degradation when compared to the original teacher models. "

In this work, we introduce MuLA-GAN, a novel approach that leverages the synergistic power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Multi-Level Attention mechanisms for comprehensive underwater image enhancement. The integration of Multi-Level Attention within the GAN architecture significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features crucial for precise image restoration. By selectively focusing on relevant spatial and multi-level features, our model excels in capturing and preserving intricate details in underwater imagery, essential for various applications. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses on diverse datasets, including UIEB test dataset, UIEB challenge dataset, U45, and UCCS dataset, highlight the superior performance of MuLA-GAN compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Experimental evaluations on a specialized dataset tailored for bio-fouling and aquaculture applications demonstrate the model's robustness in challenging environmental conditions. On the UIEB test dataset, MuLA-GAN achieves exceptional PSNR (25.59) and SSIM (0.893) scores, surpassing Water-Net, the second-best model, with scores of 24.36 and 0.885, respectively. This work not only addresses a significant research gap in underwater image enhancement but also underscores the pivotal role of Multi-Level Attention in enhancing GANs, providing a novel and comprehensive framework for restoring underwater image quality.

        "abstract": "The \"lifting from 2D pose\" method has been the dominant approach to 3D Human Pose Estimation (3DHPE) due to the powerful visual analysis ability of 2D pose estimators. Widely known, there exists a depth ambiguity problem when estimating solely from 2D pose, where one 2D pose can be mapped to multiple 3D poses. Intuitively, the rich semantic and texture information in images can contribute to a more accurate \"lifting\" procedure. Yet, existing research encounters two primary challenges. Firstly, the distribution of image data in 3D motion capture datasets is too narrow because of the laboratorial environment, which leads to poor generalization ability of methods trained with image information. Secondly, effective strategies for leveraging image information are lacking. In this paper, we give new insight into the cause of poor generalization problems and the effectiveness of image features. Based on that, we propose an advanced framework. Specifically, the framework consists of two stages. First, we enable the keypoints to query and select the beneficial features from all image patches. To reduce the keypoints attention to inconsequential background features, we design a novel Pose-guided Transformer Layer, which adaptively limits the updates to unimportant image patches. Then, through a designed Adaptive Feature Selection Module, we prune less significant image patches from the feature map. In the second stage, we allow the keypoints to further emphasize the retained critical image features. This progressive learning approach prevents further training on insignificant image features. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the Human3.6M dataset and the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset. "

        "abstract": "Abductive reasoning is logical reasoning that makes educated guesses to infer the most likely reasons to explain the observations. However, the abductive logical reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) is underexplored in KG literature. In this paper, we initially and formally raise the task of abductive logical reasoning over KGs, which involves inferring the most probable logic hypothesis from the KGs to explain an observed entity set. Traditional approaches use symbolic methods, like searching, to tackle the knowledge graph problem. However, the symbolic methods are unsuitable for this task, because the KGs are naturally incomplete, and the logical hypotheses can be complex with multiple variables and relations. To address these issues, we propose a generative approach to create logical expressions based on observations. First, we sample hypothesis-observation pairs from the KG and use supervised training to train a generative model that generates hypotheses from observations. Since supervised learning only minimizes structural differences between generated and reference hypotheses, higher structural similarity does not guarantee a better explanation for observations. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Reinforcement Learning from the Knowledge Graph (RLF-KG) method, which minimizes the differences between observations and conclusions drawn from the generated hypotheses according to the KG. Experimental results demonstrate that transformer-based generative models can generate logical explanations robustly and efficiently. Moreover, with the assistance of RLF-KG, the generated hypothesis can provide better explanations for the observations, and the method of supervised learning with RLF-KG achieves state-of-the-art results on abductive knowledge graph reasoning on three widely used KGs.

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models has gained significant popularity in various research fields. Existing methods for fine-tuning can be roughly divided into two categories, namely Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and High-Performance Fine-Tuning. The former aims at improving efficiency, while the latter focuses on enhancing performance. Beyond these methods, we demonstrate that Partial Fine-Tuning can be an innovative and promising direction capable of concurrently enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. We first validate eight manually-defined partial fine-tuning strategies across kinds of datasets and vision transformer architectures, and find that some partial fine-tuning strategies (e.g., ffn only or attention only) can achieve better performance with fewer tuned parameters than full fine-tuning, and selecting appropriate layers is critical to partial fine-tuning. Thus, we propose a novel fine-tuned angle metric to guide the selection of appropriate layers for partial fine-tuning, making it flexible to be adapted to various scenarios for more practicable partial fine-tuning. Additionally, we show that partial fine-tuning can serve as a new dimension for Model Soups, improving both the model performance and generalization with fewer tuned parameters. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of datasets and models validate the great potential of partial fine-tuning. "

However, existing methods often neglect the spatial semantics of word images, leading to suboptimal detection recall rates for long and short words within long-tailed word length distributions that exist prominently in dense scenes. In this paper, we present WordLenSpotter, a novel word length-aware spotter for scene text image detection and recognition, improving the spotting capabilities for long and short words, particularly in the tail data of dense text images. We first design an image encoder equipped with a dilated convolutional fusion module to integrate multiscale text image features effectively. Then, leveraging the Transformer framework, we synergistically optimize text detection and recognition accuracy after iteratively refining text region image features using the word length prior. Specially, we design a Spatial Length Predictor module (SLP) using character count prior tailored to different word lengths to constrain the regions of interest effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized word Length-aware Segmentation (LenSeg) proposal head, enhancing the network's capacity to capture the distinctive features of long and short terms within categories characterized by long-tailed distributions. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and our dense text spotting dataset DSTD1500 demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods, particularly in dense text image detection and recognition tasks involving long-tailed word length distributions encompassing a range of long and short words.

Fine-tuning LLMs for program repair is a recent avenue of research, with many dimensions which have not been explored. Existing work mostly fine-tunes LLMs with naive code representations and is fundamentally limited in its ability to fine-tune larger LLMs. To address this problem, we propose RepairLLaMA, a novel program repair approach that combines 1) code representations for APR and 2) the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning technique called LoRA. This results in RepairLLaMA producing a highly effective `program repair adapter' for fixing bugs with language models. Our experiments demonstrate the validity of both concepts. First, fine-tuning adapters with program repair specific code representations enables the model to use meaningful repair signals. Second, parameter-efficient fine-tuning helps fine-tuning to converge and contributes to the effectiveness of the repair adapter to fix data-points outside the fine-tuning data distribution. Overall, RepairLLaMA correctly fixes 125 Defects4J v2 and 82 HumanEval-Java bugs, outperforming all baselines. "

It is widely recognized that employing larger inversion and denoising steps in diffusion model leads to improved image reconstruction quality. However, the editing performance of diffusion models tends to be no more satisfactory even with increasing denoising steps. The deficiency in editing could be attributed to the conditional Markovian property of the editing process, where errors accumulate throughout denoising steps. To tackle this challenge, we first propose an innovative framework where a rectifier module is incorporated to modulate diffusion model weights with residual features, thereby providing compensatory information to bridge the fidelity gap. Furthermore, we introduce a novel learning paradigm aimed at minimizing error propagation during the editing process, which trains the editing procedure in a manner similar to denoising score-matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework and training strategy achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and editing results across various levels of denoising steps, meanwhile exhibits exceptional performance in terms of both quantitative metric and qualitative assessments.

In this work, we propose a simple \\textit{Induce-then-Contrast} Decoding (ICD) strategy to alleviate hallucinations. We first construct a factually weak LLM by inducing hallucinations from the original LLMs. Then, we penalize these induced hallucinations during decoding to enhance the factuality of the generated content. Concretely, we determine the final next-token predictions by amplifying the predictions from the original model and downplaying the induced untruthful predictions via contrastive decoding. Experimental results on both discrimination-based and generation-based hallucination evaluation benchmarks, such as TruthfulQA and \\textsc{FActScore}, demonstrate that our proposed ICD methods can effectively enhance the factuality of LLMs across various model sizes and families. For example, when equipped with ICD, Llama2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct achieve performance comparable to ChatGPT and GPT4 on TruthfulQA, respectively. "

In this work, we end the current fragmented situation and propose UniRef++ to unify the four reference-based object segmentation tasks with a single architecture. At the heart of our approach is the proposed UniFusion module which performs multiway-fusion for handling different tasks with respect to their specified references. And a unified Transformer architecture is then adopted for achieving instance-level segmentation. With the unified designs, UniRef++ can be jointly trained on a broad range of benchmarks and can flexibly complete multiple tasks at run-time by specifying the corresponding references. We evaluate our unified models on various benchmarks. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed UniRef++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on RIS and RVOS, and performs competitively on FSS and VOS with a parameter-shared network.

To this end, we introduce exploratory research and find consistent patterns of positional bias in LLMs that influence the performance of recommendation across a range of scenarios. Then, we propose a Bayesian probabilistic framework, STELLA (Stable LLM for Recommendation), which involves a two-stage pipeline. During the first probing stage, we identify patterns in a transition matrix using a probing detection dataset. And in the second recommendation stage, a Bayesian strategy is employed to adjust the biased output of LLMs with an entropy indicator. Therefore, our framework can capitalize on existing pattern information to calibrate instability of LLMs, and enhance recommendation performance. Finally, extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of our framework. "

One of the key reasons is the limited scale of publicly available data (e.g., 10M video-text pairs in WebVid10M vs. 5B image-text pairs in LAION), considering the high cost of video captioning. Instead, it could be far easier to collect unlabeled clips from video platforms like YouTube. Motivated by this, we come up with a novel text-to-video generation framework, termed TF-T2V, which can directly learn with text-free videos. The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling. To this end, we employ a content branch and a motion branch, which are jointly optimized with weights shared. Following such a pipeline, we study the effect of doubling the scale of training set (i.e., video-only WebVid10M) with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441), demonstrating the scalability of our approach.

Traditional probabilistic approaches rely on producing ensembles from physics-based models, which sample from a joint distribution over spatio-temporally coherent weather trajectories, but are expensive to run. An efficient alternative is to use a machine learning (ML) forecast model to generate the ensemble, however state-of-the-art ML forecast models for medium-range weather are largely trained to produce deterministic forecasts which minimise mean-squared-error. Despite improving skills scores, they lack physical consistency, a limitation that grows at longer lead times and impacts their ability to characterize the joint distribution. We introduce GenCast, a ML-based generative model for ensemble weather forecasting, trained from reanalysis data. It forecasts ensembles of trajectories for 84 weather variables, for up to 15 days at 1 degree resolution globally, taking around a minute per ensemble member on a single Cloud TPU v4 device.

While the incorporation of visual information holds the promise of enhancing recommendation accuracy and alleviating the cold-start problem, it is essential to point out that the inclusion of item images may introduce substantial security challenges. Some existing works have shown that the item provider can manipulate item exposure rates to its advantage by constructing adversarial images. However, these works cannot reveal the real vulnerability of visually-aware recommender systems because (1) The generated adversarial images are markedly distorted, rendering them easily detectable by human observers; (2) The effectiveness of the attacks is inconsistent and even ineffective in some scenarios. To shed light on the real vulnerabilities of visually-aware recommender systems when confronted with adversarial images, this paper introduces a novel attack method, IPDGI (Item Promotion by Diffusion Generated Image). Specifically, IPDGI employs a guided diffusion model to generate adversarial samples designed to deceive visually-aware recommender systems. Taking advantage of accurately modeling benign images' distribution by diffusion models, the generated adversarial images have high fidelity with original images, ensuring the stealth of our IPDGI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used e-commerce recommendation datasets (Amazon Beauty and Amazon Baby) with several typical visually-aware recommender systems.

We also compared performance with original neural network (NN) models to validate the accuracy. Results have shown that the NN and distilled student models have comparable accuracy to the teacher model for the 7T dataset; however, other datasets have shown significantly lower accuracy (28% on average) for NN, though our proposed distilled model is still able to achieve 12\\% higher accuracy than NN.

Despite recent progress, this field still confronts two major challenges in real-world applications: 1) improving the efficiency of constructing joint representations from unaligned multimodal features, and 2) relieving the performance decline caused by random modality feature missing. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, Modality-Collaborative Transformer with Hybrid Feature Reconstruction (MCT-HFR), to address these issues. The crucial component of MCT is a novel attention-based encoder which concurrently extracts and dynamically balances the intra- and inter-modality relations for all associated modalities. With additional modality-wise parameter sharing, a more compact representation can be encoded with less time and space complexity. To improve the robustness of MCT, we further introduce HFR which consists of two modules: Local Feature Imagination (LFI) and Global Feature Alignment (GFA). During model training, LFI leverages complete features as supervisory signals to recover local missing features, while GFA is designed to reduce the global semantic gap between pairwise complete and incomplete representations. Experimental evaluations on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms advanced baselines in both complete and incomplete data scenarios. "

        "abstract": "Designing better deep networks and better reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are both important for deep RL. This work studies the former. Specifically, the Perception and Decision-making Interleaving Transformer (PDiT) network is proposed, which cascades two Transformers in a very natural way: the perceiving one focuses on \\emph{the environmental perception} by processing the observation at the patch level, whereas the deciding one pays attention to \\emph{the decision-making} by conditioning on the history of the desired returns, the perceiver's outputs, and the actions. Such a network design is generally applicable to a lot of deep RL settings, e.g., both the online and offline RL algorithms under environments with either image observations, proprioception observations, or hybrid image-language observations. Extensive experiments show that PDiT can not only achieve superior performance than strong baselines in different settings but also extract explainable feature representations.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework KnowledgeNavigator to address these challenges by efficiently and accurately retrieving external knowledge from knowledge graph and using it as a key factor to enhance LLM reasoning. Specifically, KnowledgeNavigator first mines and enhances the potential constraints of the given question to guide the reasoning. Then it retrieves and filters external knowledge that supports answering through iterative reasoning on knowledge graph with the guidance of LLM and the question. Finally, KnowledgeNavigator constructs the structured knowledge into effective prompts that are friendly to LLM to help its reasoning. We evaluate KnowledgeNavigator on multiple public KGQA benchmarks, the experiments show the framework has great effectiveness and generalization, outperforming previous knowledge graph enhanced LLM methods and is comparable to the fully supervised models.

The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time. "

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge in face personalization techniques, benefiting from the advanced capabilities of pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Among these, a notable method is Textual Inversion, which generates personalized images by inverting given images into textual embeddings. However, methods based on Textual Inversion still struggle with balancing the trade-off between reconstruction quality and editability. In this study, we examine this issue through the lens of initialization. Upon closely examining traditional initialization methods, we identified a significant disparity between the initial and learned embeddings in terms of both scale and orientation. The scale of the learned embedding can be up to 100 times greater than that of the initial embedding. Such a significant change in the embedding could increase the risk of overfitting, thereby compromising the editability. Driven by this observation, we introduce a novel initialization method, termed Cross Initialization, that significantly narrows the gap between the initial and learned embeddings. This method not only improves both reconstruction and editability but also reduces the optimization steps from 5000 to 320. Furthermore, we apply a regularization term to keep the learned embedding close to the initial embedding. We show that when combined with Cross Initialization, this regularization term can effectively improve editability. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence to demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the baseline methods. Notably, in our experiments, Cross Initialization is the only method that successfully edits an individual's facial expression. Additionally, a fast version of our method allows for capturing an input image in roughly 26 seconds, while surpassing the baseline methods in terms of both reconstruction and editability.

        "abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for various practical applications, spurring the construction of many large-scale trajectory datasets, including vehicles and pedestrians. However, discrepancies exist among datasets due to external factors and data acquisition strategies. External factors include geographical differences and driving styles, while data acquisition strategies include data acquisition rate, history/prediction length, and detector/tracker error. Consequently, the proficient performance of models trained on large-scale datasets has limited transferability on other small-size datasets, bounding the utilization of existing large-scale datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a method based on continuous and stochastic representations of Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE) for alleviating discrepancies due to data acquisition strategy. We utilize the benefits of continuous representation for handling arbitrary time steps and the use of stochastic representation for handling detector/tracker errors. Additionally, we propose a dataset-specific diffusion network and its training framework to handle dataset-specific detection/tracking errors. The effectiveness of our method is validated against state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models on the popular benchmark datasets: nuScenes, Argoverse, Lyft, INTERACTION, and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). Improvement in performance gain on various source and target dataset configurations shows the generalized competence of our approach in addressing cross-dataset discrepancies. "

The recent progress in large-scale generative models has further expanded their use in real-world language applications. However, the critical challenge of improving the generalizability and factuality of LLMs in natural language understanding and question answering remains under-explored. While previous in-context learning research has focused on enhancing models to adhere to users' specific instructions and quality expectations, and to avoid undesired outputs, little to no work has explored the use of task-Specific fine-tuned Language Models (SLMs) to improve LLMs' in-context learning during the inference stage.

Intriguingly, we note a relatively consistent performance of probing classifiers on the set of probing tasks. Our observations indicate that CC-LLMs, while outperforming their out-of-the-box counterparts, exhibit a tendency to rely less on encoding surface, syntactic, and semantic properties, highlighting the intricate interplay between domain-specific adaptation and probing task performance opening up opportunities to explore behavior of fine-tuned language models in specialized contexts.

Federated learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling collaborative learning from decentralized data while still preserving the data privacy of clients. Despite the great benefits foundation models can have empowered by federated learning, they face severe computation, communication, and statistical challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage federated learning algorithm called FedMS. A global expert is trained in the first stage and a local expert is trained in the second stage to provide better personalization. We construct a Mixture of Foundation Models (MoFM) with these two experts and design a gate neural network with an inserted gate adapter that joins the aggregation every communication round in the second stage. To further adapt to edge computing scenarios with limited computational resources, we design a novel Sparsely Activated LoRA (SAL) algorithm that freezes the pre-trained foundation model parameters inserts low-rank adaptation matrices into transformer blocks and activates them progressively during the training. We employ extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of FedMS, results show that FedMS outperforms other SOTA baselines by up to 55.25% in default settings. "

We observe that the radiance from each pixel in panoramic images can be modeled as both a signal to convey scene lighting information and a light source to illuminate other pixels. Hence, we propose the irradiance fields from sparse LDR panoramic images, which increases the observation counts for faithful geometry recovery and leverages the irradiance-radiance attenuation for HDR reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the irradiance fields outperform state-of-the-art methods on both geometry recovery and HDR reconstruction and validate their effectiveness.

While existing methods can produce physically plausible dances, they often struggle to generalize to out-of-set data. The challenge arises from three aspects: 1) the high diversity of dance movements and significant differences in the distribution of music modalities, which make it difficult to generate music-aligned dance movements. 2) the lack of a large-scale music-dance dataset, which hinders the generation of generalized dance movements from music. 3) The protracted nature of dance movements poses a challenge to the maintenance of a consistent dance style. In this work, we introduce the EnchantDance framework, a state-of-the-art method for dance generation. Due to the redundancy of the original dance sequence along the time axis, EnchantDance first constructs a strong dance latent space and then trains a dance diffusion model on the dance latent space. To address the data gap, we construct a large-scale music-dance dataset, ChoreoSpectrum3D Dataset, which includes four dance genres and has a total duration of 70.32 hours, making it the largest reported music-dance dataset to date. To enhance consistency between music genre and dance style, we pre-train a music genre prediction network using transfer learning and incorporate music genre as extra conditional information in the training of the dance diffusion model.

        "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian, as an explicit 3D representation method, has demonstrated strong competitiveness over NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) in terms of expressing complex scenes and training duration. These advantages signal a wide range of applications for 3D Gaussians in 3D understanding and editing. Meanwhile, the segmentation of 3D Gaussians is still in its infancy. The existing segmentation methods are not only cumbersome but also incapable of segmenting multiple objects simultaneously in a short amount of time. In response, this paper introduces a 3D Gaussian segmentation method implemented with 2D segmentation as supervision. This approach uses input 2D segmentation maps to guide the learning of the added 3D Gaussian semantic information, while nearest neighbor clustering and statistical filtering refine the segmentation results. Experiments show that our concise method can achieve comparable performances on mIOU and mAcc for multi-object segmentation as previous single-object segmentation methods. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16054",
        "abstract": "Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stances toward unseen targets. Incorporating background knowledge to enhance transferability between seen and unseen targets constitutes the primary approach of ZSSD. However, these methods often struggle with a knowledge-task disconnect and lack logical consistency in their predictions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach named Logically Consistent Chain-of-Thought (LC-CoT) for ZSSD, which improves stance detection by ensuring relevant and logically sound knowledge extraction. LC-CoT employs a three-step process. Initially, it assesses whether supplementary external knowledge is necessary. Subsequently, it uses API calls to retrieve this knowledge, which can be processed by a separate LLM. Finally, a manual exemplar guides the LLM to infer stance categories, using an if-then logical structure to maintain relevance and logical coherence. This structured approach to eliciting background knowledge enhances the model's capability, outperforming traditional supervised methods without relying on labeled data. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16066",
        "abstract": "(Source) code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a key role in helping developers understand and maintain source code. Recently, with the successful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields, software engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solve code summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instruction prompting and task-oriented fine-tuning. However, instruction prompting involves designing crafted prompts for zero-shot learning or selecting appropriate samples for few-shot learning and requires users to have professional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires high training costs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for code summarization called PromptCS. PromptCS trains a prompt agent that can generate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in code summarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuous prompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier to understand by LLMs. PromptCS freezes the parameters of LLMs when training the prompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources. We evaluate PromptCS on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving multiple programming languages. The results show that PromptCS significantly outperforms instruction prompting schemes on all four widely used metrics. In some base LLMs, e.g., CodeGen-Multi-2B and StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS even outperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, the training efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs. The results of the human evaluation demonstrate that PromptCS can generate more good summaries compared to baselines.

Accurate personality trait estimation is crucial not only for enhancing personalization in human-computer interaction but also for a wide variety of applications ranging from mental health to education. This paper analyzes the capability of a generic chatbot, ChatGPT, to effectively infer personality traits from short texts. We report the results of a comprehensive user study featuring texts written in Czech by a representative population sample of 155 participants. Their self-assessments based on the Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire serve as the ground truth. We compare the personality trait estimations made by ChatGPT against those by human raters and report ChatGPT's competitive performance in inferring personality traits from text. We also uncover a 'positivity bias' in ChatGPT's assessments across all personality dimensions and explore the impact of prompt composition on accuracy. This work contributes to the understanding of AI capabilities in psychological assessment, highlighting both the potential and limitations of using large language models for personality inference. Our research underscores the importance of responsible AI development, considering ethical implications such as privacy, consent, autonomy, and bias in AI applications. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16084",
        "abstract": "Human lives in a 3D world and commonly uses natural language to interact with a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 3D object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably, LangSplat is extremely efficient, achieving a {\\speed} $\\times$ speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 $\\times$ 1080.

        "abstract": "Recent work in zero-shot listwise reranking using LLMs has achieved state-of-the-art results. However, these methods are not without drawbacks. The proposed methods rely on large LLMs with billions of parameters and limited context sizes.

Our approaches demonstrate competitive reranking effectiveness compared to recent state-of-the-art LLM rerankers with substantially smaller models. Through LiT5-Score, we also explore the use of cross-attention to calculate relevance scores to perform reranking, eliminating the reliance on external passage relevance labels for training. We present a range of models from 220M parameters to 3B parameters, all with strong reranking results, challenging the necessity of large-scale models for effective zero-shot reranking and opening avenues for more efficient listwise reranking solutions.

        "abstract": "The prevalent use of commercial and open-source diffusion models (DMs) for text-to-image generation prompts risk mitigation to prevent undesired behaviors. Existing concept erasing methods in academia are all based on full parameter or specification-based fine-tuning, from which we observe the following issues: 1) Generation alternation towards erosion: Parameter drift during target elimination causes alternations and potential deformations across all generations, even eroding other concepts at varying degrees, which is more evident with multi-concept erased; 2) Transfer inability & deployment inefficiency: Previous model-specific erasure impedes the flexible combination of concepts and the training-free transfer towards other models, resulting in linear cost growth as the deployment scenarios increase. To achieve non-invasive, precise, customizable, and transferable elimination, we ground our erasing framework on one-dimensional adapters to erase multiple concepts from most DMs at once across versatile erasing applications. The concept-SemiPermeable structure is injected as a Membrane (SPM) into any DM to learn targeted erasing, and meantime the alteration and erosion phenomenon is effectively mitigated via a novel Latent Anchoring fine-tuning strategy. Once obtained, SPMs can be flexibly combined and plug-and-play for other DMs without specific re-tuning, enabling timely and efficient adaptation to diverse scenarios. During generation, our Facilitated Transport mechanism dynamically regulates the permeability of each SPM to respond to different input prompts, further minimizing the impact on other concepts. Quantitative and qualitative results across ~40 concepts, 7 DMs and 4 erasing applications have demonstrated the superior erasing of SPM. Our code and pre-tuned SPMs will be available on the project page https://lyumengyao.github.io/projects/spm. "

        "abstract": "The way the media presents events can significantly affect public perception, which in turn can alter people's beliefs and views. Media bias describes a one-sided or polarizing perspective on a topic. This article summarizes the research on computational methods to detect media bias by systematically reviewing 3140 research papers published between 2019 and 2022. To structure our review and support a mutual understanding of bias across research domains, we introduce the Media Bias Taxonomy, which provides a coherent overview of the current state of research on media bias from different perspectives. We show that media bias detection is a highly active research field, in which transformer-based classification approaches have led to significant improvements in recent years. These improvements include higher classification accuracy and the ability to detect more fine-granular types of bias. However, we have identified a lack of interdisciplinarity in existing projects, and a need for more awareness of the various types of media bias to support methodologically thorough performance evaluations of media bias detection systems. Concluding from our analysis, we see the integration of recent machine learning advancements with reliable and diverse bias assessment strategies from other research areas as the most promising area for future research contributions in the field.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot capabilities in various document reranking tasks. Despite their successful implementations, there is still a gap in existing literature on their effectiveness in low-resource languages. To address this gap, we investigate how LLMs function as rerankers in cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems for African languages. Our implementation covers English and four African languages (Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba) and we examine cross-lingual reranking with queries in English and passages in the African languages. Additionally, we analyze and compare the effectiveness of monolingual reranking using both query and document translations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs when leveraging their own generated translations. To get a grasp of the effectiveness of multiple LLMs, our study focuses on the proprietary models RankGPT-4 and RankGPT-3.5, along with the open-source model, RankZephyr. While reranking remains most effective in English, our results reveal that cross-lingual reranking may be competitive with reranking in African languages depending on the multilingual capability of the LLM.

        "abstract": "Crystal material representation is the foundation of crystal material research. Existing works consider crystal molecules as graph data with different representation methods and leverage the advantages of techniques in graph learning. A reasonable crystal representation method should capture the local and global information. However, existing methods only consider the local information of crystal molecules by modeling the bond distance and bond angle of first-order neighbors of atoms, which leads to the issue that different crystals will have the same representation. To solve this many-to-one issue, we consider the global information by further considering dihedral angles, which can guarantee that the proposed representation corresponds one-to-one with the crystal material. We first propose a periodic complete representation and calculation algorithm for infinite extended crystal materials. A theoretical proof for the representation that satisfies the periodic completeness is provided. Based on the proposed representation, we then propose a network for predicting crystal material properties, PerCNet, with a specially designed message passing mechanism. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world material benchmark datasets. The PerCNet achieves the best performance among baseline methods in terms of MAE. In addition, our results demonstrate the importance of the periodic scheme and completeness for crystal representation learning. "

        "abstract": "In Magnetic Particle Imaging, a field-free region is maneuvered throughout the field of view using a time-varying magnetic field known as the drive-field. Human-sized systems operate the drive-field in the kHz range and generate it by utilizing strong currents that can rise to the kA range within a coil called the drive field generator. Matching and tuning between a power amplifier, a band-pass filter and the drive-field generator is required. Here, for reasons of safety in future human scanners, a symmetrical topology and a transformer, called inductive coupling network is used. Our primary objectives are to achieve floating potentials to ensure patient safety, attaining high linearity and high gain for the resonant transformer. We present a novel systematic approach to the design of a loss-optimized resonant toroid with a D-shaped cross section, employing segmentation to adjust the inductance-to-resistance ratio while maintaining a constant quality factor. Simultaneously, we derive a specific matching condition of a symmetric transmit-receive circuit for magnetic particle imaging. The chosen setup filters the fundamental frequency and allows simultaneous signal transmission and reception. In addition, the decoupling of multiple drive field channels is discussed and the primary side of the transformer is evaluated for maximum coupling and minimum stray field. Two prototypes were constructed, measured, decoupled, and compared to the derived theory and to method-of-moment based simulations. "

In this paper, we propose a principled framework based on the widely-known Apollonian packing process to generate new planar network, i.e., Type-II Apollonian network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$. The manipulation is different from that of the typical Apollonian network, and is proceeded in terms of the iterative addition of triangle instead of vertex. As a consequence, network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$ turns out to be hamiltonian and eulerian, however, the typical Apollonian network is not. Then, we in-depth study some fundamental structural properties on network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$, and verify that network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$ is sparse like most real-world networks, has scale-free feature and small-world property, and exhibits disassortative mixing structure. Next, we design an effective algorithm for solving the problem of how to enumerate spanning trees on network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$, and derive the asymptotic solution of the spanning tree entropy, which suggests that Type-II Apollonian network is more reliable to a random removal of edges than the typical Apollonian network. Additionally, we study trapping problem on network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$, and use average trapping time as metric to show that Type-II Apollonian network $\\mathcal{A}_{t}$ has better structure for fast information diffusion than the typical Apollonian network.

Addressing this diagnostic odyssey thus have substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. However, existing methods using frontal facial photo were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates the facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes of patients to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also introduce GestaltGPT, a GPT-based methodology with few-short learning capacities that exclusively harnesses textual inputs using a range of large language models (LLMs) including Llama 2, GPT-J and Falcon. We evaluated these methods on a diverse range of datasets, including 449 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets on Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, NAA10-related syndrome (neurodevelopmental syndrome) and others.

Recently, deep generative models have exhibited remarkable potential for generating therapeutic peptides, but they only utilize sequence or structure information alone, which hinders the performance in generation. In this study, we propose a Multi-Modal Contrastive Diffusion model (MMCD), fusing both sequence and structure modalities in a diffusion framework to co-generate novel peptide sequences and structures. Specifically, MMCD constructs the sequence-modal and structure-modal diffusion models, respectively, and devises a multi-modal contrastive learning strategy with intercontrastive and intra-contrastive in each diffusion timestep, aiming to capture the consistency between two modalities and boost model performance. The inter-contrastive aligns sequences and structures of peptides by maximizing the agreement of their embeddings, while the intra-contrastive differentiates therapeutic and non-therapeutic peptides by maximizing the disagreement of their sequence/structure embeddings simultaneously. The extensive experiments demonstrate that MMCD performs better than other state-of-theart deep generative methods in generating therapeutic peptides across various metrics, including antimicrobial/anticancer score, diversity, and peptide-docking.
