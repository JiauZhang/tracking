        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently vision transformer models have become prominent models for a range of tasks. These models, however, usually suffer from intensive computational costs, making them impractical for deployment on edge platforms. Recent studies have proposed to prune transformers in a series of criteria, such as magnitude-based, gradient-based, and mask-based. However, previous works rely heavily on hand-crafted rules and may involve time-consuming retraining or searching. As a result, measuring weight importance in an automatic and efficient way remains an open problem. To solve this problem, we propose a novel explainable pruning framework dubbed X-Pruner, by considering the explainability of the pruning criterion. Inspired by the model explanation, we propose to assign an explainability-aware mask for each prunable unit, which measures the unit's contribution to predicting every class and is fully differentiable. Then, to preserve the most informative units, we rank all units based on the absolute sum of their explainability-aware masks and using this ranking to prune enough units to meet the target resource constraint. To verify and evaluate our method, we apply the X-Pruner on representative transformer models including the DeiT and Swin Transformer. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed X-Pruner outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box methods with significantly reduced computational costs and slight performance degradation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Glaucoma is a chronic visual disease that may cause permanent irreversible blindness. Measurement of the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) plays a pivotal role in the detection of glaucoma in its early stage, preventing visual disparities. Therefore, accurate and automatic segmentation of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) from retinal fundus images is a fundamental requirement. Existing CNN-based segmentation frameworks resort to building deep encoders with aggressive downsampling layers, which suffer from a general limitation on modeling explicit long-range dependency. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new segmentation pipeline, called UT-Net, availing the advantages of U-Net and transformer both in its encoding layer, followed by an attention-gated bilinear fusion scheme. In addition to this, we incorporate Multi-Head Contextual attention to enhance the regular self-attention used in traditional vision transformers. Thus low-level features along with global dependencies are captured in a shallow manner. Besides, we extract context information at multiple encoding layers for better exploration of receptive fields, and to aid the model to learn deep hierarchical representations. Finally, an enhanced mixing loss is proposed to tightly supervise the overall learning process. The proposed model has been implemented for joint OD and OC segmentation on three publicly available datasets: DRISHTI-GS, RIM-ONE R3, and REFUGE. Additionally, to validate our proposal, we have performed exhaustive experimentation on Glaucoma detection from all three datasets by measuring the Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR) value. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of UT-Net as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Gaining the trust and confidence of customers is the essence of the growth and success of financial institutions and organizations. Of late, the financial industry is significantly impacted by numerous instances of fraudulent activities. Further, owing to the generation of large voluminous datasets, it is highly essential that underlying framework is scalable and meet real time needs. To address this issue, in the study, we proposed ATM fraud detection in static and streaming contexts respectively. In the static context, we investigated a parallel and scalable machine learning algorithms for ATM fraud detection that is built on Spark and trained with a variety of machine learning (ML) models including Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also employed several balancing techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and its variants, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to address the rarity in the dataset. In addition, we proposed a streaming based ATM fraud detection in the streaming context. Our sliding window based method collects ATM transactions that are performed within a specified time interval and then utilizes to train several ML models, including NB, RF, DT, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). We selected these models based on their less model complexity and quicker response time. In both contexts, RF turned out to be the best model. RF obtained the best mean AUC of 0.975 in the static context and mean AUC of 0.910 in the streaming context. RF is also empirically proven to be statistically significant than the next-best performing models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing oriented object detection methods commonly use metric AP$_{50}$ to measure the performance of the model. We argue that AP$_{50}$ is inherently unsuitable for oriented object detection due to its large tolerance in angle deviation. Therefore, we advocate using high-precision metric, e.g. AP$_{75}$, to measure the performance of models. In this paper, we propose an Aspect Ratio Sensitive Oriented Object Detector with Transformer, termed ARS-DETR, which exhibits a competitive performance in high-precision oriented object detection. Specifically, a new angle classification method, calling Aspect Ratio aware Circle Smooth Label (AR-CSL), is proposed to smooth the angle label in a more reasonable way and discard the hyperparameter that introduced by previous work (e.g. CSL). Then, a rotated deformable attention module is designed to rotate the sampling points with the corresponding angles and eliminate the misalignment between region features and sampling points. Moreover, a dynamic weight coefficient according to the aspect ratio is adopted to calculate the angle loss. Comprehensive experiments on several challenging datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance on the high-precision oriented object detection task. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Accurately estimating 3D hand pose is crucial for understanding how humans interact with the world. Despite remarkable progress, existing methods often struggle to generate plausible hand poses when the hand is heavily occluded or blurred. In videos, the movements of the hand allow us to observe various parts of the hand that may be occluded or blurred in a single frame. To adaptively leverage the visual clue before and after the occlusion or blurring for robust hand pose estimation, we propose the Deformer: a framework that implicitly reasons about the relationship between hand parts within the same image (spatial dimension) and different timesteps (temporal dimension). We show that a naive application of the transformer self-attention mechanism is not sufficient because motion blur or occlusions in certain frames can lead to heavily distorted hand features and generate imprecise keys and queries. To address this challenge, we incorporate a Dynamic Fusion Module into Deformer, which predicts the deformation of the hand and warps the hand mesh predictions from nearby frames to explicitly support the current frame estimation. Furthermore, we have observed that errors are unevenly distributed across different hand parts, with vertices around fingertips having disproportionately higher errors than those around the palm. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new loss function called maxMSE that automatically adjusts the weight of every vertex to focus the model on critical hand parts. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10%, and is more robust to occlusions (over 14%). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Monocular depth estimation is a challenging task that predicts the pixel-wise depth from a single 2D image. Current methods typically model this problem as a regression or classification task. We propose DiffusionDepth, a new approach that reformulates monocular depth estimation as a denoising diffusion process. It learns an iterative denoising process to `denoise' random depth distribution into a depth map with the guidance of monocular visual conditions. The process is performed in the latent space encoded by a dedicated depth encoder and decoder. Instead of diffusing ground truth (GT) depth, the model learns to reverse the process of diffusing the refined depth of itself into random depth distribution. This self-diffusion formulation overcomes the difficulty of applying generative models to sparse GT depth scenarios. The proposed approach benefits this task by refining depth estimation step by step, which is superior for generating accurate and highly detailed depth maps. Experimental results on KITTI and NYU-Depth-V2 datasets suggest that a simple yet efficient diffusion approach could reach state-of-the-art performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with acceptable inference time. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from MRI scans is important to quantify disease progression. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown top performance for this task when a large amount of labeled data is available. However, the accuracy of CNNs suffers when dealing with few and/or sparsely labeled datasets. A potential solution is to leverage the information available in large public datasets in conjunction with a target dataset which only has limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a training framework, SSL2 (self-supervised-semi-supervised), for multi-modality MS lesion segmentation with limited supervision. We adopt self-supervised learning to leverage the knowledge from large public 3T datasets to tackle the limitations of a small 7T target dataset. To leverage the information from unlabeled 7T data, we also evaluate state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods for other limited annotation settings, such as small labeled training size and sparse annotations. We use the shifted-window (Swin) transformer1 as our backbone network. The effectiveness of self-supervised and semi-supervised training strategies is evaluated in our in-house 7T MRI dataset. The results indicate that each strategy improves lesion segmentation for both limited training data size and for sparse labeling scenarios. The combined overall framework further improves the performance substantially compared to either of its components alone. Our proposed framework thus provides a promising solution for future data/label-hungry 7T MS studies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Edit fidelity is a significant issue in open-world controllable generative image editing. Recently, CLIP-based approaches have traded off simplicity to alleviate these problems by introducing spatial attention in a handpicked layer of a StyleGAN. In this paper, we propose CoralStyleCLIP, which incorporates a multi-layer attention-guided blending strategy in the feature space of StyleGAN2 for obtaining high-fidelity edits. We propose multiple forms of our co-optimized region and layer selection strategy to demonstrate the variation of time complexity with the quality of edits over different architectural intricacies while preserving simplicity. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and benchmark our method against state-of-the-art CLIP-based methods. Our findings suggest that CoralStyleCLIP results in high-quality edits while preserving the ease of use. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose a novel generative model-based attack on learnable image encryption methods proposed for privacy-preserving deep learning. Various learnable encryption methods have been studied to protect the sensitive visual information of plain images, and some of them have been investigated to be robust enough against all existing attacks. However, previous attacks on image encryption focus only on traditional cryptanalytic attacks or reverse translation models, so these attacks cannot recover any visual information if a block-scrambling encryption step, which effectively destroys global information, is applied. Accordingly, in this paper, generative models are explored to evaluate whether such models can restore sensitive visual information from encrypted images for the first time. We first point out that encrypted images have some similarity with plain images in the embedding space. By taking advantage of leaked information from encrypted images, we propose a guided generative model as an attack on learnable image encryption to recover personally identifiable visual information. We implement the proposed attack in two ways by utilizing two state-of-the-art generative models: a StyleGAN-based model and latent diffusion-based one. Experiments were carried out on the CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Results show that images reconstructed by the proposed method have perceptual similarities to plain images. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Layout generation aims to synthesize realistic graphic scenes consisting of elements with different attributes including category, size, position, and between-element relation. It is a crucial task for reducing the burden on heavy-duty graphic design works for formatted scenes, e.g., publications, documents, and user interfaces (UIs). Diverse application scenarios impose a big challenge in unifying various layout generation subtasks, including conditional and unconditional generation. In this paper, we propose a Layout Diffusion Generative Model (LDGM) to achieve such unification with a single decoupled diffusion model. LDGM views a layout of arbitrary missing or coarse element attributes as an intermediate diffusion status from a completed layout. Since different attributes have their individual semantics and characteristics, we propose to decouple the diffusion processes for them to improve the diversity of training samples and learn the reverse process jointly to exploit global-scope contexts for facilitating generation. As a result, our LDGM can generate layouts either from scratch or conditional on arbitrary available attributes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our proposed LDGM outperforms existing layout generation models in both functionality and performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable results in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks with in-context learning, which involves inference based on a few demonstration examples. Despite their successes in NLP tasks, no investigation has been conducted to assess the ability of LLMs to perform document information extraction (DIE) using in-context learning. Applying LLMs to DIE poses two challenges: the modality and task gap. To this end, we propose a simple but effective in-context learning framework called ICL-D3IE, which enables LLMs to perform DIE with different types of demonstration examples. Specifically, we extract the most difficult and distinct segments from hard training documents as hard demonstrations for benefiting all test instances. We design demonstrations describing relationships that enable LLMs to understand positional relationships. We introduce formatting demonstrations for easy answer extraction. Additionally, the framework improves diverse demonstrations by updating them iteratively. Our experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the ICL-D3IE framework enables GPT-3/ChatGPT to achieve superior performance when compared to previous pre-trained methods fine-tuned with full training in both the in-distribution (ID) setting and in the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The problem of realistic VQA (RVQA), where a model has to reject unanswerable questions (UQs) and answer answerable ones (AQs), is studied. We first point out 2 drawbacks in current RVQA research, where (1) datasets contain too many unchallenging UQs and (2) a large number of annotated UQs are required for training. To resolve the first drawback, we propose a new testing dataset, RGQA, which combines AQs from an existing VQA dataset with around 29K human-annotated UQs. These UQs consist of both fine-grained and coarse-grained image-question pairs generated with 2 approaches: CLIP-based and Perturbation-based. To address the second drawback, we introduce an unsupervised training approach. This combines pseudo UQs obtained by randomly pairing images and questions, with an RoI Mixup procedure to generate more fine-grained pseudo UQs, and model ensembling to regularize model confidence. Experiments show that using pseudo UQs significantly outperforms RVQA baselines. RoI Mixup and model ensembling further increase the gain. Finally, human evaluation reveals a performance gap between humans and models, showing that more RVQA research is needed. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D single object tracking has been a crucial problem for decades with numerous applications such as autonomous driving. Despite its wide-ranging use, this task remains challenging due to the significant appearance variation caused by occlusion and size differences among tracked targets. To address these issues, we present MBPTrack, which adopts a Memory mechanism to utilize past information and formulates localization in a coarse-to-fine scheme using Box Priors given in the first frame. Specifically, past frames with targetness masks serve as an external memory, and a transformer-based module propagates tracked target cues from the memory to the current frame. To precisely localize objects of all sizes, MBPTrack first predicts the target center via Hough voting. By leveraging box priors given in the first frame, we adaptively sample reference points around the target center that roughly cover the target of different sizes. Then, we obtain dense feature maps by aggregating point features into the reference points, where localization can be performed more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, while running at 50 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Balancing efficiency and accuracy is a long-standing problem for deploying deep learning models. The trade-off is even more important for real-time safety-critical systems like autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for accelerating transformer-based 3D object detectors by dynamically halting tokens at different layers depending on their contribution to the detection task. Although halting a token is a non-differentiable operation, our method allows for differentiable end-to-end learning by leveraging an equivalent differentiable forward-pass. Furthermore, our framework allows halted tokens to be reused to inform the model's predictions through a straightforward token recycling mechanism. Our method significantly improves the Pareto frontier of efficiency versus accuracy when compared with the existing approaches. By halting tokens and increasing model capacity, we are able to improve the baseline model's performance without increasing the model's latency on the Waymo Open Dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multi-person pose forecasting remains a challenging problem, especially in modeling fine-grained human body interaction in complex crowd scenarios. Existing methods typically represent the whole pose sequence as a temporal series, yet overlook interactive influences among people based on skeletal body parts. In this paper, we propose a novel Trajectory-Aware Body Interaction Transformer (TBIFormer) for multi-person pose forecasting via effectively modeling body part interactions. Specifically, we construct a Temporal Body Partition Module that transforms all the pose sequences into a Multi-Person Body-Part sequence to retain spatial and temporal information based on body semantics. Then, we devise a Social Body Interaction Self-Attention (SBI-MSA) module, utilizing the transformed sequence to learn body part dynamics for inter- and intra-individual interactions. Furthermore, different from prior Euclidean distance-based spatial encodings, we present a novel and efficient Trajectory-Aware Relative Position Encoding for SBI-MSA to offer discriminative spatial information and additional interactive clues. On both short- and long-term horizons, we empirically evaluate our framework on CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D as well as synthesized datasets (6 ~ 10 persons), and demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Few-shot instance segmentation extends the few-shot learning paradigm to the instance segmentation task, which tries to segment instance objects from a query image with a few annotated examples of novel categories. Conventional approaches have attempted to address the task via prototype learning, known as point estimation. However, this mechanism is susceptible to noise and suffers from bias due to a significant scarcity of data. To overcome the disadvantages of the point estimation mechanism, we propose a novel approach, dubbed MaskDiff, which models the underlying conditional distribution of a binary mask, which is conditioned on an object region and $K$-shot information. Inspired by augmentation approaches that perturb data with Gaussian noise for populating low data density regions, we model the mask distribution with a diffusion probabilistic model. In addition, we propose to utilize classifier-free guided mask sampling to integrate category information into the binary mask generation process. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both base and novel classes of the COCO dataset while simultaneously being more stable than existing methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human brains respond to semantic features of presented stimuli with different neurons. It is then curious whether modern deep neural networks admit a similar behavior pattern. Specifically, this paper finds a small cluster of neurons in a diffusion model corresponding to a particular subject. We call those neurons the concept neurons. They can be identified by statistics of network gradients to a stimulation connected with the given subject. The concept neurons demonstrate magnetic properties in interpreting and manipulating generation results. Shutting them can directly yield the related subject contextualized in different scenes. Concatenating multiple clusters of concept neurons can vividly generate all related concepts in a single image. A few steps of further fine-tuning can enhance the multi-concept capability, which may be the first to manage to generate up to four different subjects in a single image. For large-scale applications, the concept neurons are environmentally friendly as we only need to store a sparse cluster of int index instead of dense float32 values of the parameters, which reduces storage consumption by 90\% compared with previous subject-driven generation methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative studies on diverse scenarios show the superiority of our method in interpreting and manipulating diffusion models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work presents RiDDLE, short for Reversible and Diversified De-identification with Latent Encryptor, to protect the identity information of people from being misused. Built upon a pre-learned StyleGAN2 generator, RiDDLE manages to encrypt and decrypt the facial identity within the latent space. The design of RiDDLE has three appealing properties. First, the encryption process is cipher-guided and hence allows diverse anonymization using different passwords. Second, the true identity can only be decrypted with the correct password, otherwise the system will produce another de-identified face to maintain the privacy. Third, both encryption and decryption share an efficient implementation, benefiting from a carefully tailored lightweight encryptor. Comparisons with existing alternatives confirm that our approach accomplishes the de-identification task with better quality, higher diversity, and stronger reversibility. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of RiDDLE in anonymizing videos. Code and models will be made publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most of the approaches published in the literature to construct S-boxes via Cellular Automata (CA) work by either iterating a finite CA for several time steps, or by a one-shot application of the global rule. The main characteristic that brings together these works is that they employ a single CA rule to define the vectorial Boolean function of the S-box. In this work, we explore a different direction for the design of S-boxes that leverages on Orthogonal CA (OCA), i.e. pairs of CA rules giving rise to orthogonal Latin squares. The motivation stands on the facts that an OCA pair already defines a bijective transformation, and moreover the orthogonality property of the resulting Latin squares ensures a minimum amount of diffusion. We exhaustively enumerate all S-boxes generated by OCA pairs of diameter $4 \le d \le 6$, and measure their nonlinearity. Interestingly, we observe that for $d=4$ and $d=5$ all S-boxes are linear, despite the underlying CA local rules being nonlinear. The smallest nonlinear S-boxes emerges for $d=6$, but their nonlinearity is still too low to be used in practice. Nonetheless, we unearth an interesting structure of linear OCA S-boxes, proving that their Linear Components Space (LCS) is itself the image of a linear CA, or equivalently a polynomial code. We finally classify all linear OCA S-boxes in terms of their generator polynomials. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, we discover an extraordinary phenomenon: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Based on this discovery, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods. Extensive experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45 and PatternNet datasets show that our methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper explores the task of detecting images generated by text-to-image diffusion models. To evaluate this, we consider images generated from captions in the MSCOCO and Wikimedia datasets using two state-of-the-art models: Stable Diffusion and GLIDE. Our experiments show that it is possible to detect the generated images using simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), starting from features extracted by CLIP, or traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We also observe that models trained on images generated by Stable Diffusion can detect images generated by GLIDE relatively well, however, the reverse is not true. Lastly, we find that incorporating the associated textual information with the images rarely leads to significant improvement in detection results but that the type of subject depicted in the image can have a significant impact on performance. This work provides insights into the feasibility of detecting generated images, and has implications for security and privacy concerns in real-world applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Unfortunately, the immense amount of computations and memory accesses required for LLM training makes them prohibitively expensive in terms of hardware cost, and thus challenging to deploy in use cases such as on-device learning. In this paper, motivated by the observation that LLM training is memory-bound, we propose a novel dynamic quantization strategy, termed Dynamic Stashing Quantization (DSQ), that puts a special focus on reducing the memory operations, but also enjoys the other benefits of low precision training, such as the reduced arithmetic cost. We conduct a thorough study on two translation tasks (trained-from-scratch) and three classification tasks (fine-tuning). DSQ reduces the amount of arithmetic operations by $20.95\times$ and the number of DRAM operations by $2.55\times$ on IWSLT17 compared to the standard 16-bit fixed-point, which is widely used in on-device learning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In neural decoding research, one of the most intriguing topics is the reconstruction of perceived natural images based on fMRI signals. Previous studies have succeeded in re-creating different aspects of the visuals, such as low-level properties (shape, texture, layout) or high-level features (category of objects, descriptive semantics of scenes) but have typically failed to reconstruct these properties together for complex scene images. Generative AI has recently made a leap forward with latent diffusion models capable of generating high-complexity images. Here, we investigate how to take advantage of this innovative technology for brain decoding. We present a two-stage scene reconstruction framework called ``Brain-Diffuser''. In the first stage, starting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level properties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder) model. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent diffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text and visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images. On the publicly available Natural Scenes Dataset benchmark, our method outperforms previous models both qualitatively and quantitatively. When applied to synthetic fMRI patterns generated from individual ROI (region-of-interest) masks, our trained model creates compelling ``ROI-optimal'' scenes consistent with neuroscientific knowledge. Thus, the proposed methodology can have an impact on both applied (e.g. brain-computer interface) and fundamental neuroscience. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

In addition to providing a private messaging service, Telegram, with its channels, represents a valid medium for rapidly broadcasting content to a large audience (COVID-19 announcements), but, unfortunately, also for disseminating radical ideologies and coordinating attacks (Capitol Hill riot). This paper presents the TGDataset, a new dataset that includes 120,979 Telegram channels and over 400 million messages, making it the largest collection of Telegram channels to the best of our knowledge. After a brief introduction to the data collection process, we analyze the languages spoken within our dataset and the topic covered by English channels. Finally, we discuss some use cases in which our dataset can be extremely useful to understand better the Telegram ecosystem, as well as to study the diffusion of questionable news. In addition to the raw dataset, we released the scripts we used to analyze the dataset and the list of channels belonging to the network of a new conspiracy theory called Sabmyk. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Latent diffusion models for image generation have crossed a quality threshold which enabled them to achieve mass adoption. Recently, a series of works have made advancements towards replicating this success in the 3D domain, introducing techniques such as point cloud VAE, triplane representation, neural implicit surfaces and differentiable rendering based training. We take another step along this direction, combining these developments in a two-step pipeline consisting of 1) a triplane VAE which can learn latent representations of textured meshes and 2) a conditional diffusion model which generates the triplane features. For the first time this architecture allows conditional and unconditional generation of high quality textured or untextured 3D meshes across multiple diverse categories in a few seconds on a single GPU. It outperforms previous work substantially on image-conditioned and unconditional generation on mesh quality as well as texture generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our model to large datasets for increased quality and diversity. We will release our code and trained models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the largest Large Language Models (LLM) with over 175 billion parameters. ChatGPT has demonstrated the impressive capabilities of LLM, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the emergence of the discussion and application of LLM in various research or engineering domains, it is time to envision how LLM may revolutionize the way we approach intelligent transportation systems. This paper explores the future applications of LLM in addressing key transportation problems. By leveraging LLM and a cross-modal encoder, an intelligent system can handle traffic data from various modalities and execute transportation operations through a single LLM. NLP, combined with cross-modal processing, is investigated with its potential applications in transportation. To demonstrate this potential, a smartphone-based crash report auto-generation and analysis framework is presented as a use case. Despite the potential benefits, challenges related to data privacy, data quality, and model bias must be considered. Overall, the use of LLM in intelligent transport systems holds promise for more efficient, intelligent, and sustainable transportation systems that improve the lives of people around the world. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The ability to automatically identify industry sector coverage in articles on legal developments, or any kind of news articles for that matter, can bring plentiful of benefits both to the readers and the content creators themselves. By having articles tagged based on industry coverage, readers from all around the world would be able to get to legal news that are specific to their region and professional industry. Simultaneously, writers would benefit from understanding which industries potentially lack coverage or which industries readers are currently mostly interested in and thus, they would focus their writing efforts towards more inclusive and relevant legal news coverage. In this paper, a Machine Learning-powered industry analysis approach which combined Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Statistical and Machine Learning (ML) techniques was investigated. A dataset consisting of over 1,700 annotated legal articles was created for the identification of six industry sectors. Text and legal based features were extracted from the text. Both traditional ML methods (e.g. gradient boosting machine algorithms, and decision-tree based algorithms) and deep neural network (e.g. transformer models) were applied for performance comparison of predictive models. The system achieved promising results with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores above 0.90 and F-scores above 0.81 with respect to the six industry sectors. The experimental results show that the suggested automated industry analysis which employs ML techniques allows the processing of large collections of text data in an easy, efficient, and scalable way. Traditional ML methods perform better than deep neural networks when only a small and domain-specific training data is available for the study. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The use of BERT, one of the most popular language models, has led to improvements in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER) i.e. automatic identification of named entities such as location, person, organization, etc. from a given text. It is also an important base step for many NLP tasks such as information extraction and argumentation mining. Even though there is much research done on NER using BERT and other popular language models, the same is not explored in detail when it comes to Legal NLP or Legal Tech. Legal NLP applies various NLP techniques such as sentence similarity or NER specifically on legal data. There are only a handful of models for NER tasks using BERT language models, however, none of these are aimed at legal documents in German. In this paper, we fine-tune a popular BERT language model trained on German data (German BERT) on a Legal Entity Recognition (LER) dataset. To make sure our model is not overfitting, we performed a stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The results we achieve by fine-tuning German BERT on the LER dataset outperform the BiLSTM-CRF+ model used by the authors of the same LER dataset. Finally, we make the model openly available via HuggingFace. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have limited performance when solving arithmetic reasoning tasks and often provide incorrect answers. Unlike natural language understanding, math problems typically have a single correct answer, making the task of generating accurate solutions more challenging for LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any LLMs that indicate their level of confidence in their responses which fuels a trust deficit in these models impeding their adoption. To address this deficiency, we propose `MathPrompter', a technique that improves performance of LLMs on arithmetic problems along with increased reliance in the predictions. MathPrompter uses the Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique to generate multiple Algebraic expressions or Python functions to solve the same math problem in different ways and thereby raise the confidence level in the output results. This is in contrast to other prompt based CoT methods, where there is no check on the validity of the intermediate steps followed. Our technique improves over state-of-the-art on the MultiArith dataset ($78.7\%\rightarrow92.5\%$) evaluated using 175B parameter GPT-based LLM. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The goal of this project is to create and study novel techniques to identify early warning signals for socially disruptive events, like riots, wars, or revolutions using only publicly available data on social media. Such techniques need to be robust enough to work on real-time data: to achieve this goal we propose a topological approach together with more standard BERT models. Indeed, topology-based algorithms, being provably stable against deformations and noise, seem to work well in low-data regimes. The general idea is to build a binary classifier that predicts if a given tweet is related to a disruptive event or not. The results indicate that the persistent-gradient approach is stable and even more performant than deep-learning-based anomaly detection algorithms. We also benchmark the generalisability of the methodology against out-of-samples tasks, with very promising results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLMs) are used to generate content for a wide range of tasks, and are set to reach a growing audience in coming years due to integration in product interfaces like ChatGPT or search engines like Bing. This intensifies the need to ensure that models are aligned with human preferences and do not produce unsafe, inaccurate or toxic outputs. While alignment techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and red-teaming can mitigate some safety concerns and improve model capabilities, it is unlikely that an aggregate fine-tuning process can adequately represent the full range of users' preferences and values. Different people may legitimately disagree on their preferences for language and conversational norms, as well as on values or ideologies which guide their communication. Personalising LLMs through micro-level preference learning processes may result in models that are better aligned with each user. However, there are several normative challenges in defining the bounds of a societally-acceptable and safe degree of personalisation. In this paper, we ask how, and in what ways, LLMs should be personalised. First, we review literature on current paradigms for aligning LLMs with human feedback, and identify issues including (i) a lack of clarity regarding what alignment means; (ii) a tendency of technology providers to prescribe definitions of inherently subjective preferences and values; and (iii) a 'tyranny of the crowdworker', exacerbated by a lack of documentation in who we are really aligning to. Second, we present a taxonomy of benefits and risks associated with personalised LLMs, for individuals and society at large. Finally, we propose a three-tiered policy framework that allows users to experience the benefits of personalised alignment, while restraining unsafe and undesirable LLM-behaviours within (supra-)national and organisational bounds. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have recently attracted increasing attention by showing impressive synthesis quality. DDMs are built on a diffusion process that pushes data to the noise distribution and the models learn to denoise. In this paper, we establish the interpretation of DDMs in terms of image restoration (IR). Integrating IR literature allows us to use an alternative objective and diverse forward processes, not confining to the diffusion process. By imposing prior knowledge on the loss function grounded on MAP-based estimation, we eliminate the need for the expensive sampling of DDMs. Also, we propose a multi-scale training, which improves the performance compared to the diffusion process, by taking advantage of the flexibility of the forward process. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the quality and efficiency of both training and inference. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our model to inverse problems. We believe that our framework paves the way for designing a new type of flexible general generative model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have been popular paradigms for large-scale vision representation pre-training. However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB signals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for the encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long pre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the pixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from pre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning. Different from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked Autoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level representations without interference during pre-training. For high-level semantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder to capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level structures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel values for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level and low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning conflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior visual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE base pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after fine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous state-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we present an open-set object detector, called Grounding DINO, by marrying Transformer-based detector DINO with grounded pre-training, which can detect arbitrary objects with human inputs such as category names or referring expressions. The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes. Grounding DINO performs remarkably well on all three settings, including benchmarks on COCO, LVIS, ODinW, and RefCOCO/+/g. Grounding DINO achieves a $52.5$ AP on the COCO detection zero-shot transfer benchmark, i.e., without any training data from COCO. It sets a new record on the ODinW zero-shot benchmark with a mean $26.1$ AP. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO}. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing large language model-based code generation pipelines typically use beam search or sampling algorithms during the decoding process. Although the programs they generate achieve high token-matching-based scores, they often fail to compile or generate incorrect outputs. The main reason is that conventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for code generation. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer decoding algorithm, Planning-Guided Transformer Decoding (PG-TD), that uses a planning algorithm to do lookahead search and guide the Transformer to generate better programs. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the generated sequences, the Transformer makes use of a planner to generate candidate programs and test them on public test cases. The Transformer can therefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually lead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares information between the Transformer and the planner to make our algorithm computationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several large language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks, showing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher performance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables controllable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes by optimizing modified objective. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recent success of text-to-image synthesis has taken the world by storm and captured the general public's imagination. From a technical standpoint, it also marked a drastic change in the favored architecture to design generative image models. GANs used to be the de facto choice, with techniques like StyleGAN. With DALL-E 2, auto-regressive and diffusion models became the new standard for large-scale generative models overnight. This rapid shift raises a fundamental question: can we scale up GANs to benefit from large datasets like LAION? We find that na\"Ively increasing the capacity of the StyleGAN architecture quickly becomes unstable. We introduce GigaGAN, a new GAN architecture that far exceeds this limit, demonstrating GANs as a viable option for text-to-image synthesis. GigaGAN offers three major advantages. First, it is orders of magnitude faster at inference time, taking only 0.13 seconds to synthesize a 512px image. Second, it can synthesize high-resolution images, for example, 16-megapixel pixels in 3.66 seconds. Finally, GigaGAN supports various latent space editing applications such as latent interpolation, style mixing, and vector arithmetic operations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing approaches to system identification (estimating the physical parameters of an object) from videos assume known object geometries. This precludes their applicability in a vast majority of scenes where object geometries are complex or unknown. In this work, we aim to identify parameters characterizing a physical system from a set of multi-view videos without any assumption on object geometry or topology. To this end, we propose "Physics Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Fields" (PAC-NeRF), to estimate both the unknown geometry and physical parameters of highly dynamic objects from multi-view videos. We design PAC-NeRF to only ever produce physically plausible states by enforcing the neural radiance field to follow the conservation laws of continuum mechanics. For this, we design a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation of the neural radiance field, i.e., we use the Eulerian grid representation for NeRF density and color fields, while advecting the neural radiance fields via Lagrangian particles. This hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation seamlessly blends efficient neural rendering with the material point method (MPM) for robust differentiable physics simulation. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on geometry and physical parameter estimation over a vast range of materials, including elastic bodies, plasticine, sand, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and demonstrate significant performance gain on most tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Advanced large language models like ChatGPT have gained considerable attention recently, including among students. However, while the debate on ChatGPT in academia is making waves, more understanding is needed among lecturers and teachers on how students use and perceive ChatGPT. To address this gap, we analyzed the content on ChatGPT available on TikTok in February 2023. TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform popular among individuals under 30. Specifically, we analyzed the content of the 100 most popular videos in English tagged with #chatgpt, which collectively garnered over 250 million views. Most of the videos we studied promoted the use of ChatGPT for tasks like writing essays or code. In addition, many videos discussed AI detectors, with a focus on how other tools can help to transform ChatGPT output to fool these detectors. This also mirrors the discussion among educators on how to treat ChatGPT as lecturers and teachers in teaching and grading. What is, however, missing from the analyzed clips on TikTok are videos that discuss ChatGPT producing content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the training data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This method utilises score-based diffusion models in conjunction with transformers which are well suited to the task of generating jets as particle clouds due to their permutation equivariance. PC-JeDi achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art methods across several metrics that evaluate the quality of the generated jets. Although slower than other models, due to the large number of forward passes required by diffusion models, it is still substantially faster than traditional detailed simulation. Furthermore, PC-JeDi uses conditional generation to produce jets with a desired mass and transverse momentum for two different particles, top quarks and gluons. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) aims to map tissue properties non-invasively via models that relate these unknown quantities to measured MRI signals. Estimating these unknowns, which has traditionally required model fitting - an often iterative procedure, can now be done with one-shot machine learning (ML) approaches. Such parameter estimation may be complicated by intrinsic qMRI signal model degeneracy: different combinations of tissue properties produce the same signal. Despite their many advantages, it remains unclear whether ML approaches can resolve this issue. Growing empirical evidence appears to suggest ML approaches remain susceptible to model degeneracy. Here we demonstrate under the right circumstances ML can address this issue. Inspired by recent works on the impact of training data distributions on ML-based parameter estimation, we propose to resolve model degeneracy by designing training data distributions. We put forward a classification of model degeneracies and identify one particular kind of degeneracies amenable to the proposed attack. The strategy is demonstrated successfully using the Revised NODDI model with standard multi-shell diffusion MRI data as an exemplar. Our results illustrate the importance of training set design which has the potential to allow accurate estimation of tissue properties with ML. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
