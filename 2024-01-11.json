        "abstract": "In this paper, we design a real-time question-answering system specifically targeted for helping sellers get relevant material/documentation they can share live with their customers or refer to during a call. Taking the Seismic content repository as a relatively large scale example of a diverse dataset of sales material, we demonstrate how LLM embeddings of sellers' queries can be matched with the relevant content. We achieve this by engineering prompts in an elaborate fashion that makes use of the rich set of meta-features available for documents and sellers. Using a bi-encoder with cross-encoder re-ranker architecture, we show how the solution returns the most relevant content recommendations in just a few seconds even for large datasets. Our recommender system is deployed as an AML endpoint for real-time inferencing and has been integrated into a Copilot interface that is now deployed in the production version of the Dynamics CRM, known as MSX, used daily by Microsoft sellers.

        "abstract": "We propose DiffSHEG, a Diffusion-based approach for Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture generation with arbitrary length. While previous works focused on co-speech gesture or expression generation individually, the joint generation of synchronized expressions and gestures remains barely explored. To address this, our diffusion-based co-speech motion generation transformer enables uni-directional information flow from expression to gesture, facilitating improved matching of joint expression-gesture distributions. Furthermore, we introduce an outpainting-based sampling strategy for arbitrary long sequence generation in diffusion models, offering flexibility and computational efficiency. Our method provides a practical solution that produces high-quality synchronized expression and gesture generation driven by speech. Evaluated on two public datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, a user study confirms the superiority of DiffSHEG over prior approaches. By enabling the real-time generation of expressive and synchronized motions, DiffSHEG showcases its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents. "

        "abstract": "While dust significantly affects the environmental perception of automated agricultural machines, the existing deep learning-based methods for dust removal require further research and improvement in this area to improve the performance and reliability of automated agricultural machines in agriculture. We propose an end-to-end trainable learning network (DedustNet) to solve the real-world agricultural dust removal task. To our knowledge, DedustNet is the first time Swin Transformer-based units have been used in wavelet networks for agricultural image dusting. Specifically, we present the frequency-dominated block (DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block) by adding a spatial features aggregation scheme (SFAS) to the Swin Transformer and combining it with the wavelet transform, the DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block, alleviating the limitation of the global receptive field of Swin Transformer when dealing with complex dusty backgrounds. Furthermore, We propose a cross-level information fusion module to fuse different levels of features and effectively capture global and long-range feature relationships. In addition, we present a dilated convolution module to capture contextual information guided by wavelet transform at multiple scales, which combines the advantages of wavelet transform and dilated convolution. Our algorithm leverages deep learning techniques to effectively remove dust from images while preserving the original structural and textural features. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, DedustNet achieves superior performance and more reliable results in agricultural image dedusting, providing strong support for the application of agricultural machinery in dusty environments. Additionally, the impressive performance on real-world hazy datasets and application tests highlights DedustNet superior generalization ability and computer vision-related application performance. "

        "abstract": "Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, pre-training such models can take considerable resources that are almost only available to high-resource languages. On the contrary, static word embeddings are easier to train in terms of computing resources and the amount of data required. In this paper, we introduce MoSECroT Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual Zero-shot Transfer), a novel and challenging task that is especially relevant to low-resource languages for which static word embeddings are available. To tackle the task, we present the first framework that leverages relative representations to construct a common space for the embeddings of a source language PLM and the static word embeddings of a target language. In this way, we can train the PLM on source-language training data and perform zero-shot transfer to the target language by simply swapping the embedding layer. However, through extensive experiments on two classification datasets, we show that although our proposed framework is competitive with weak baselines when addressing MoSECroT, it fails to achieve competitive results compared with some strong baselines. In this paper, we attempt to explain this negative result and provide several thoughts on possible improvement. "

As this paradigm continues to spread, wireless systems must also evolve to identify active transmitters and unauthorized waveforms in real time under intentional distortion of preambles, extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and challenging channel conditions. We overcome limitations of correlation-based preamble matching methods in such conditions through the design of T-PRIME: a Transformer-based machine learning approach. T-PRIME learns the structural design of transmitted frames through its attention mechanism, looking at sequence patterns that go beyond the preamble alone. The paper makes three contributions: First, it compares Transformer models and demonstrates their superiority over traditional methods and state-of-the-art neural networks. Second, it rigorously analyzes T-PRIME's real-time feasibility on DeepWave's AIR-T platform. Third, it utilizes an extensive 66 GB dataset of over-the-air (OTA) WiFi transmissions for training, which is released along with the code for community use. Results reveal nearly perfect (i.e. $>98\\%$) classification accuracy under simulated scenarios, showing $100\\%$ detection improvement over legacy methods in low SNR ranges, $97\\%$ classification accuracy for OTA single-protocol transmissions and up to $75\\%$ double-protocol classification accuracy in interference scenarios.

        "abstract": "This paper develops a graph reinforcement learning approach to online planning of the schedule and destinations of electric aircraft that comprise an urban air mobility (UAM) fleet operating across multiple vertiports. This fleet scheduling problem is formulated to consider time-varying demand, constraints related to vertiport capacity, aircraft capacity and airspace safety guidelines, uncertainties related to take-off delay, weather-induced route closures, and unanticipated aircraft downtime. Collectively, such a formulation presents greater complexity, and potentially increased realism, than in existing UAM fleet planning implementations. To address these complexities, a new policy architecture is constructed, primary components of which include: graph capsule conv-nets for encoding vertiport and aircraft-fleet states both abstracted as graphs; transformer layers encoding time series information on demand and passenger fare; and a Multi-head Attention-based decoder that uses the encoded information to compute the probability of selecting each available destination for an aircraft. Trained with Proximal Policy Optimization, this policy architecture shows significantly better performance in terms of daily averaged profits on unseen test scenarios involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircraft, when compared to a random baseline and genetic algorithm-derived optimal solutions, while being nearly 1000 times faster in execution than the latter.

In our research, we focus on the healthcare domain and investigate the problem of symptom recognition from colloquial texts by designing and evaluating several training strategies for BERT-based model fine-tuning. These strategies are distinguished by the choice of the base model, the training corpora, and application of term perturbations in the training data. The best-performing models trained using these strategies outperform the state-of-the-art specialized symptom recognizer by a large margin. Through a series of experiments, we have found specific patterns of model behavior associated with the training strategies we designed. We present design principles for training strategies for effective entity recognition in colloquial texts based on our findings. "

        "abstract": "Are LLMs cultural technologies like photocopiers or printing presses, which transmit information but cannot create new content? A challenge for this idea, which we call bibliotechnism, is that LLMs often do generate entirely novel text. We begin by defending bibliotechnism against this challenge, showing how novel text may be meaningful only in a derivative sense, so that the content of this generated text depends in an important sense on the content of original human text. We go on to present a different, novel challenge for bibliotechnism, stemming from examples in which LLMs generate \"novel reference\", using novel names to refer to novel entities. Such examples could be smoothly explained if LLMs were not cultural technologies but possessed a limited form of agency (beliefs, desires, and intentions). According to interpretationism in the philosophy of mind, a system has beliefs, desires and intentions if and only if its behavior is well-explained by the hypothesis that it has such states. In line with this view, we argue that cases of novel reference provide evidence that LLMs do in fact have beliefs, desires, and intentions, and thus have a limited form of agency. "

        "abstract": "The goal of our work is to generate high-quality novel views from monocular videos of complex and dynamic scenes. Prior methods, such as DynamicNeRF, have shown impressive performance by leveraging time-varying dynamic radiation fields. However, these methods have limitations when it comes to accurately modeling the motion of complex objects, which can lead to inaccurate and blurry renderings of details. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that builds upon a recent generalization NeRF, which aggregates nearby views onto new viewpoints. However, such methods are typically only effective for static scenes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a module that operates in both the time and frequency domains to aggregate the features of object motion. This allows us to learn the relationship between frames and generate higher-quality images. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene datasets. Specifically, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both the accuracy and visual quality of the synthesized views. "

        "abstract": "Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is crucial for path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Accurately forecasting crowd trajectories is challenging due to the uncertain nature of human motions in different environments. For training, recent deep learning-based prediction approaches mainly utilize information like trajectory history and interactions between pedestrians, among others. This can limit the prediction performance across various scenarios since the discrepancies between training datasets have not been properly incorporated. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a graph transformer structure to improve prediction performance, capturing the differences between the various sites and scenarios contained in the datasets. In particular, a self-attention mechanism and a domain adaption module have been designed to improve the generalization ability of the model. Moreover, an additional metric considering cross-dataset sequences is introduced for training and performance evaluation purposes. The proposed framework is validated and compared against existing methods using popular public datasets, i.e., ETH and UCY. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed scheme. "

        "abstract": "As LLMs have become capable of processing more complex types of inputs, researchers have recently studied how to efficiently and affordably process possibly arbitrarily long sequences. One effective approach is to use a FIFO memory to store keys and values of an attention sublayer from past chunks to allow subsequent queries to attend. However, this approach requires a large memory and/or takes into the consideration the specific LM architecture. Moreover, due to the causal nature between the key-values in prior context and the queries at present, this approach cannot be extended to bidirectional attention such as in an encoder-decoder or PrefixLM decoder-only architecture. In this paper, we propose to use eviction policies, such as LRA and LFA, to reduce the memory size and adapt to various architectures, and we also propose the Attendre layer, a wait-to-attend mechanism by retrieving the key-value memory (K/V memory) with evicted queries in the query memory (Q memory). As a first step, we evaluate this method in the context length extension setup using the TriviaQA reading comprehension task, and show the effectiveness of the approach. "

In this paper, we identified that multi-user chatbots have more complex 3W design dimensions -- \"What\" to say, \"When\" to respond, and \"Who\" to answer. Additionally, we proposed Multi-User Chat Assistant (MUCA), which is an LLM-based framework for chatbots specifically designed for group discussions. MUCA consists of three main modules: Sub-topic Generator, Dialog Analyzer, and Utterance Strategies Arbitrator. These modules jointly determine suitable response contents, timings, and the appropriate recipients. To make the optimizing process for MUCA easier, we further propose an LLM-based Multi-User Simulator (MUS) that can mimic real user behavior. This enables faster simulation of a conversation between the chatbot and simulated users, making the early development of the chatbot framework much more efficient. MUCA demonstrates effectiveness, including appropriate chime-in timing, relevant content, and positive user engagement, in goal-oriented conversations with a small to medium number of participants, as evidenced by case studies and experimental results from user studies.

        "abstract": "Video Captioning (VC) is a challenging multi-modal task since it requires describing the scene in language by understanding various and complex videos. For machines, the traditional VC follows the \"imaging-compression-decoding-and-then-captioning\" pipeline, where compression is pivot for storage and transmission. However, in such a pipeline, some potential shortcomings are inevitable, i.e., information redundancy resulting in low efficiency and information loss during the sampling process for captioning. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel VC pipeline to generate captions directly from the compressed measurement, which can be captured by a snapshot compressive sensing camera and we dub our model SnapCap. To be more specific, benefiting from the signal simulation, we have access to obtain abundant measurement-video-annotation data pairs for our model. Besides, to better extract language-related visual representations from the compressed measurement, we propose to distill the knowledge from videos via a pre-trained CLIP with plentiful language-vision associations to guide the learning of our SnapCap. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SnapCap, we conduct experiments on two widely-used VC datasets. Both the qualitative and quantitative results verify the superiority of our pipeline over conventional VC pipelines. In particular, compared to the \"caption-after-reconstruction\" methods, our SnapCap can run at least 3$\\times$ faster, and achieve better caption results. "

        "abstract": "Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations, while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences. "

To this end, we propose a mixed block consisting of three modules, transformer, attention Long short-term memory (attention LSTM), and Fourier transformer. We are the first to attempt leveraging transformer to learn long temporal dependencies within eye movement. Second, we incorporate the attention mechanism into LSTM to propose attention LSTM with the aim to learn short temporal dependencies. Third, we perform self attention in the frequency domain to learn global features. As the three modules provide complementary feature representations in terms of local and global dependencies, the proposed EmMixformer is capable of improving recognition accuracy. The experimental results on our eye movement dataset and two public eye movement datasets show that the proposed EmMixformer outperforms the state of the art by achieving the lowest verification error.

In this paper, we develop a novel bond-based nonlocal diffusion model with matrix-valued coefficients in non-divergence form. Our approach incorporates the coefficients into a covariance matrix and employs the multivariate Gaussian function with truncation to define the kernel function, and subsequently model the nonlocal diffusion process through the bond-based formulation. We successfully establish the well-posedness of the proposed model along with deriving some of its properties on maximum principle and mass conservation. Furthermore, an efficient linear collocation scheme is designed for numerical solution of our model. Comprehensive experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to showcase application of the proposed nonlocal model to both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion problems and to demonstrate numerical accuracy and effective asymptotic compatibility of the proposed collocation scheme.

        "abstract": "Recently, large language models such as ChatGPT have showcased remarkable abilities in solving general tasks, demonstrating the potential for applications in recommender systems. To assess how effectively LLMs can be used in recommendation tasks, our study primarily focuses on employing LLMs as recommender systems through prompting engineering. We propose a general framework for utilizing LLMs in recommendation tasks, focusing on the capabilities of LLMs as recommenders. To conduct our analysis, we formalize the input of LLMs for recommendation into natural language prompts with two key aspects, and explain how our framework can be generalized to various recommendation scenarios. As for the use of LLMs as recommenders, we analyze the impact of public availability, tuning strategies, model architecture, parameter scale, and context length on recommendation results based on the classification of LLMs. As for prompt engineering, we further analyze the impact of four important components of prompts, \\ie task descriptions, user interest modeling, candidate items construction and prompting strategies. In each section, we first define and categorize concepts in line with the existing literature. Then, we propose inspiring research questions followed by experiments to systematically analyze the impact of different factors on two public datasets. Finally, we summarize promising directions to shed lights on future research. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05012",
        "abstract": "Time series forecasting is crucial and challenging in the real world. The recent surge in interest regarding time series foundation models, which cater to a diverse array of downstream tasks, is noteworthy. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-scale nature of time series, an aspect crucial for precise forecasting. To bridge this gap, we propose HiMTM, a hierarchical multi-scale masked time series modeling method designed for long-term forecasting. Specifically, it comprises four integral components: (1) hierarchical multi-scale transformer (HMT) to capture temporal information at different scales; (2) decoupled encoder-decoder (DED) forces the encoder to focus on feature extraction, while the decoder to focus on pretext tasks; (3) multi-scale masked reconstruction (MMR) provides multi-stage supervision signals for pre-training; (4) cross-scale attention fine-tuning (CSA-FT) to capture dependencies between different scales for forecasting. Collectively, these components enhance multi-scale feature extraction capabilities in masked time series modeling and contribute to improved prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on 7 mainstream datasets to prove that HiMTM has obvious advantages over contemporary self-supervised and end-to-end learning methods. The effectiveness of HiMTM is further showcased by its application in the industry of natural gas demand forecasting. "

        "abstract": "To achieve seamless collaboration between robots and humans in a shared environment, accurately predicting future human movements is essential. Human motion prediction has traditionally been approached as a sequence prediction problem, leveraging historical human motion data to estimate future poses. Beginning with vanilla recurrent networks, the research community has investigated a variety of methods for learning human motion dynamics, encompassing graph-based and generative approaches. Despite these efforts, achieving accurate long-term predictions continues to be a significant challenge. In this regard, we present the Adversarial Motion Transformer (AdvMT), a novel model that integrates a transformer-based motion encoder and a temporal continuity discriminator. This combination effectively captures spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously within frames. With adversarial training, our method effectively reduces the unwanted artifacts in predictions, thereby ensuring the learning of more realistic and fluid human motions. The evaluation results indicate that AdvMT greatly enhances the accuracy of long-term predictions while also delivering robust short-term predictions "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05031",
        "abstract": "Transformer model empowered architectures have become a pillar of cloud services that keeps reshaping our society. However, the dynamic query loads and heterogeneous user requirements severely challenge current transformer serving systems, which rely on pre-training multiple variants of a foundation model, i.e., with different sizes, to accommodate varying service demands. Unfortunately, such a mechanism is unsuitable for large transformer models due to the additional training costs and excessive I/O delay. In this paper, we introduce OTAS, the first elastic serving system specially tailored for transformer models by exploring lightweight token management. We develop a novel idea called token adaptation that adds prompting tokens to improve accuracy and removes redundant tokens to accelerate inference. To cope with fluctuating query loads and diverse user requests, we enhance OTAS with application-aware selective batching and online token adaptation. OTAS first batches incoming queries with similar service-level objectives to improve the ingress throughput. Then, to strike a tradeoff between the overhead of token increment and the potentials for accuracy improvement, OTAS adaptively adjusts the token execution strategy by solving an optimization problem. We implement and evaluate a prototype of OTAS with multiple datasets, which show that OTAS improves the system utility by at least 18.2%. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging. Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate. Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions. Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles. This approach generates a training data via \"self-talk\" of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning. We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue. This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training. Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data. "

        "abstract": "Motion deblurring is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision and has received continuous attention. The variability in blur, both within and across images, imposes limitations on non-blind deblurring techniques that rely on estimating the blur kernel. As a response, blind motion deblurring has emerged, aiming to restore clear and detailed images without prior knowledge of the blur type, fueled by the advancements in deep learning methodologies. Despite strides in this field, a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in deep learning-based blind motion deblurring is notably absent. This paper fills that gap by providing an exhaustive overview of the role of deep learning in blind motion deblurring, encompassing datasets, evaluation metrics, and methods developed over the last six years. Specifically, we first introduce the types of motion blur and the fundamental principles of deblurring. Next, we outline the shortcomings of traditional non-blind deblurring algorithms, emphasizing the advantages of employing deep learning techniques for deblurring tasks. Following this, we categorize and summarize existing blind motion deblurring methods based on different backbone networks, including convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer networks. Subsequently, we elaborate not only on the fundamental principles of these different categories but also provide a comprehensive summary and comparison of their advantages and limitations. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results conducted on four widely used datasets further compare the performance of SOTA methods. Finally, an analysis of present challenges and future pathways.

One potential cause of the limited performance is the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and general understanding inside LLMs. To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process xIoD (Cross-Lingual Interpretation of Difficult words), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the content incurring inconsistent understanding to guide the translation. Specifically, xIoD performs the cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools of QE to tackle the challenges of xIoD in the detection of difficult words and the generation of helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark ChallengeMT, which includes cases in which multiple SOTA translation systems consistently underperform. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our xIoD, which improves up to +3.85 COMET. "

        "abstract": "With recent advancements in aerospace technology, the volume of unlabeled remote sensing image (RSI) data has increased dramatically. Effectively leveraging this data through self-supervised learning (SSL) is vital in the field of remote sensing. However, current methodologies, particularly contrastive learning (CL), a leading SSL method, encounter specific challenges in this domain. Firstly, CL often mistakenly identifies geographically adjacent samples with similar semantic content as negative pairs, leading to confusion during model training. Secondly, as an instance-level discriminative task, it tends to neglect the essential fine-grained features and complex details inherent in unstructured RSIs. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce SwiMDiff, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework designed for RSIs. SwiMDiff employs a scene-wide matching approach that effectively recalibrates labels to recognize data from the same scene as false negatives. This adjustment makes CL more applicable to the nuances of remote sensing. Additionally, SwiMDiff seamlessly integrates CL with a diffusion model. Through the implementation of pixel-level diffusion constraints, we enhance the encoder's ability to capture both the global semantic information and the fine-grained features of the images more comprehensively. Our proposed framework significantly enriches the information available for downstream tasks in remote sensing. Demonstrating exceptional performance in change detection and land-cover classification tasks, SwiMDiff proves its substantial utility and value in the field of remote sensing. "

        "abstract": "The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost. The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques imitating developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code. The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, e.g., the percentage of instances in the test set for which correct predictions are generated, leaving many open questions on the techniques' capabilities. For example, knowing that an approach is able to correctly address a reviewer's comment in 10% of cases is of little value without knowing what was asked by the reviewer: What if in all successful cases the code change required to address the comment was just the removal of an empty line? In this paper we aim at characterizing the cases in which three code review automation techniques tend to succeed or fail in the two above-described tasks. The study has a strong qualitative focus, with ~105 man-hours of manual inspection invested in manually analyzing correct and wrong predictions generated by the three techniques, for a total of 2,291 inspected predictions. The output of this analysis are two taxonomies reporting, for each of the two tasks, the types of code changes on which the experimented techniques tend to succeed or to fail, pointing to areas for future work. A result of our manual analysis was also the identification of several issues in the datasets used to train and test the experimented techniques. Finally, we assess the importance of researching in techniques specialized for code review automation by comparing their performance with ChatGPT, a general purpose large language model, finding that ChatGPT struggles in commenting code as a human reviewer would do.

        "abstract": "Fusion of a panchromatic (PAN) image and corresponding multispectral (MS) image is also known as pansharpening, which aims to combine abundant spatial details of PAN and spectral information of MS. Due to the absence of high-resolution MS images, available deep-learning-based methods usually follow the paradigm of training at reduced resolution and testing at both reduced and full resolution. When taking original MS and PAN images as inputs, they always obtain sub-optimal results due to the scale variation. In this paper, we propose to explore the self-supervised representation of pansharpening by designing a cross-predictive diffusion model, named CrossDiff. It has two-stage training. In the first stage, we introduce a cross-predictive pretext task to pre-train the UNet structure based on conditional DDPM, while in the second stage, the encoders of the UNets are frozen to directly extract spatial and spectral features from PAN and MS, and only the fusion head is trained to adapt for pansharpening task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Besides, the cross-sensor experiments also verify the generalization ability of proposed self-supervised representation learners for other satellite's datasets. We will release our code for reproducibility. "

Specifically, our approach is built upon a self-training framework; however, self-training can lead to inaccurate learning in the absence of labeled training data. To address this issue, we further integrate Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to guide the generation of pseudo-labels, termed CLIP-guided Aggregation. By leveraging CLIP's zero-shot classification capability, we use it to aggregate scores with the original predicted bounding boxes, enabling us to obtain refined scores for the pseudo-labels. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we constructed two new datasets from different domains based on the DIOR dataset, named DIOR-C and DIOR-Cloudy. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative algorithms. "

However, current works all process data uniformly without considering the problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simple questions while insufficient to intricate ones. To address this challenge, we inspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handle them individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning. First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statistical confidence score ($\\mathcal{CS}$), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquer demanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, including Prior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR), as well as their integration variants. Our experiments demonstrate that this proposed strategy significantly boosts the models' reasoning abilities across nine datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and logic tasks. For instance, compared to baseline, we make a striking improvement on low confidence subsets of 8.72\\% for AQuA, 15.07\\% for ARC Challenge and 7.71\\% for RiddleSense. In addition, through extensive analysis on length of rationale and number of options, we verify that longer reasoning paths in PKR could prevent models from referring infer-harmful shortcuts, and also find that removing irrelevant choices in FCR would substantially avoid models' confusion.

However, on close examination, these generated recipes often fail to meet basic requirements like including chicken as an ingredient in chicken dishes.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05293",
        "abstract": "Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is a recent but already widely popular method that relies on an image diffusion model to control optimization problems using text prompts. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the SDS loss function, identify an inherent problem with its formulation, and propose a surprisingly easy but effective fix. Specifically, we decompose the loss into different factors and isolate the component responsible for noisy gradients. In the original formulation, high text guidance is used to account for the noise, leading to unwanted side effects. Instead, we train a shallow network mimicking the timestep-dependent denoising deficiency of the image diffusion model in order to effectively factor it out. We demonstrate the versatility and the effectiveness of our novel loss formulation through several qualitative and quantitative experiments, including optimization-based image synthesis and editing, zero-shot image translation network training, and text-to-3D synthesis.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05300",
        "abstract": "Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference (\"This paper has six sections.\") are prevalent in many domains. Can large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present \"I am a Strange Dataset\", a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like \"The penultimate word in this sentence is\" (where a correct continuation is \"is\"). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like \"The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence.\" (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range. The dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://github.com/TristanThrush/i-am-a-strange-dataset. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05302",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in various natural language and generation tasks. However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models. While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction. In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer. We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors. The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example \"Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?\". We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains. A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities. We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test. We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation tasks, but their performance in tackling programming problems with complex data structures and algorithms remains suboptimal. To address this issue, we propose an in-context learning approach that guides LLMs to debug by using a \"print debugging\" method, which involves inserting print statements to trace and analysing logs for fixing the bug. We collect a Leetcode problem dataset and evaluate our method using the Leetcode online judging system. Experiments with GPT-4 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming rubber duck debugging in easy and medium-level Leetcode problems by 1.5% and 17.9%. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05335",
        "abstract": "We introduce InseRF, a novel method for generative object insertion in the NeRF reconstructions of 3D scenes. Based on a user-provided textual description and a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in 3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundly transformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusion models in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective in editing 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existing objects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods, which we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3D object insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The 2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method. The reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priors of monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3D scenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Our experiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicate the effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods. InseRF is capable of controllable and 3D-consistent object insertion without requiring explicit 3D information as input. Please visit our project page at https://mohamad-shahbazi.github.io/inserf. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04900",
        "abstract": "The age and mass of red giants are essential for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Traditional isochrone methods for these estimations are inherently limited due to overlapping isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, while asteroseismology, though more precise, requires high-precision, long-term observations. In response to these challenges, we developed a novel framework, Spectral Transformer (SPT), to predict the age and mass of red giants aligned with asteroseismology from their spectra. A key component of SPT, the Multi-head Hadamard Self-Attention mechanism, designed specifically for spectra, can capture complex relationships across different wavelength. Further, we introduced a Mahalanobis distance-based loss function to address scale imbalance and interaction mode loss, and incorporated Monte Carlo dropout for quantitative analysis of prediction uncertainty.Trained and tested on 3,880 red giant spectra from LAMOST, the SPT achieved remarkable age and mass estimations with average percentage errors of 17.64% and 6.61%, respectively, and provided uncertainties for each corresponding prediction. The results significantly outperform those of traditional machine learning algorithms and demonstrate a high level of consistency with asteroseismology methods and isochrone fitting techniques. In the future, our work will leverage datasets from the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to enhance the precision of the model and broaden its applicability in the field of astronomy and astrophysics.

        "abstract": "This Letter introduces an approach for precisely designing surface friction properties using a conditional generative machine learning model, specifically a diffusion denoising probabilistic model (DDPM). We created a dataset of synthetic surfaces with frictional properties determined by molecular dynamics simulations, which trained the DDPM to predict surface structures from desired frictional outcomes. Unlike traditional trial-and-error and numerical optimization methods, our approach directly yields surface designs meeting specified frictional criteria with high accuracy and efficiency. This advancement in material surface engineering demonstrates the potential of machine learning in reducing the iterative nature of surface design processes. Our findings not only provide a new pathway for precise surface property tailoring but also suggest broader applications in material science where surface characteristics are critical. "
