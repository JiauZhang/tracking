        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06781",
        "abstract": "Poker, also known as Texas Hold'em, has always been a typical research target within imperfect information games (IIGs). IIGs have long served as a measure of artificial intelligence (AI) development. Representative prior works, such as DeepStack and Libratus heavily rely on counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) to tackle heads-up no-limit Poker. However, it is challenging for subsequent researchers to learn CFR from previous models and apply it to other real-world applications due to the expensive computational cost of CFR iterations. Additionally, CFR is difficult to apply to multi-player games due to the exponential growth of the game tree size. In this work, we introduce PokerGPT, an end-to-end solver for playing Texas Hold'em with arbitrary number of players and gaining high win rates, established on a lightweight large language model (LLM). PokerGPT only requires simple textual information of Poker games for generating decision-making advice, thus guaranteeing the convenient interaction between AI and humans. We mainly transform a set of textual records acquired from real games into prompts, and use them to fine-tune a lightweight pre-trained LLM using reinforcement learning human feedback technique. To improve fine-tuning performance, we conduct prompt engineering on raw data, including filtering useful information, selecting behaviors of players with high win rates, and further processing them into textual instruction using multiple prompt engineering techniques. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that PokerGPT outperforms previous approaches in terms of win rate, model size, training time, and response speed, indicating the great potential of LLMs in solving IIGs.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06785",
        "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is a vital task for LLM practitioners. Current alignment techniques have several limitations: (1) requiring a large amount of annotated data; (2) demanding heavy human involvement; (3) lacking a systematic mechanism to continuously improve. In this work, we study aligning LLMs to a new domain with limited samples (e.g. < 100). We propose an algorithm that can self-align LLMs iteratively without active human involvement. Unlike existing works, our algorithm relies on neither human-crafted instructions nor labeled rewards, significantly reducing human involvement. In addition, our algorithm can self-improve the alignment continuously. The key idea is to first retrieve high-quality samples related to the target domain and use them as In-context Learning examples to generate more samples. Then we use the self-generated samples to finetune the LLM iteratively. We show that our method can unlock the LLMs' self-generalization ability to perform alignment with near-zero human supervision. We test our algorithm on three benchmarks in safety, truthfulness, and instruction-following, and show good performance in alignment, domain adaptability, and scalability. "

We develop the CloudEval-YAML benchmark with practicality in mind: the dataset consists of hand-written problems with unit tests targeting practical scenarios. We further enhanced the dataset to meet practical needs by rephrasing questions in a concise, abbreviated, and bilingual manner. The dataset consists of 1011 problems that take more than 1200 human hours to complete. To improve practicality during evaluation, we build a scalable evaluation platform for CloudEval-YAML that achieves a 20 times speedup over a single machine. To the best of our knowledge, the CloudEval-YAML dataset is the first hand-written dataset targeting cloud-native applications. We present an in-depth evaluation of 12 LLMs, leading to a deeper understanding of the problems and LLMs, as well as effective methods to improve task performance and reduce cost. "

We use the resulting taxonomies to assign tags that characterize merchants from a retail bank dataset. To evaluate our work, we asked 12 volunteers to answer a two-part form in which we first assessed the quality of the taxonomies created and then the tags assigned to merchants based on that taxonomy. The evaluation revealed a coherence rate exceeding 90% for the chosen taxonomies, while the average coherence for merchant tagging surpassed 80%. "

Furthermore, generative AI tools have improved to the point where they can summarize and extract the key points from research articles in succinct language. Finally, chatbots based on highly parameterized LLMs can be used to simulate abductive reasoning, which provides researchers the ability to make connections among related technical topics, which can also be used for research discovery. We review the developments in AI and generative AI for research discovery and summarization, and propose directions where these types of tools are likely to head in the future that may be of interest to statistician and data scientists.

        "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLM), conversational assistants have become prevalent for domain use cases. LLMs acquire the ability to contextual question answering through training, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) further enables the bot to answer domain-specific questions. This paper describes a RAG-based approach for building a chatbot that answers user's queries using Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) data. We train an in-house retrieval embedding model using infoNCE loss, and experimental results demonstrate that the in-house model works significantly better than the well-known general-purpose public embedding model, both in terms of retrieval accuracy and Out-of-Domain (OOD) query detection. As an LLM, we use an open API-based paid ChatGPT model. We noticed that a previously retrieved-context could be used to generate an answer for specific patterns/sequences of queries (e.g., follow-up queries). Hence, there is a scope to optimize the number of LLM tokens and cost. Assuming a fixed retrieval model and an LLM, we optimize the number of LLM tokens using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we propose a policy-based model external to the RAG, which interacts with the RAG pipeline through policy actions and updates the policy to optimize the cost. The policy model can perform two actions: to fetch FAQ context or skip retrieval. We use the open API-based GPT-4 as the reward model. We then train a policy model using policy gradient on multiple training chat sessions. As a policy model, we experimented with a public gpt-2 model and an in-house BERT model. With the proposed RL-based optimization combined with similarity threshold, we are able to achieve significant cost savings while getting a slightly improved accuracy. Though we demonstrate results for the FAQ chatbot, the proposed RL approach is generic and can be experimented with any existing RAG pipeline. "

        "abstract": "Abstractive speech summarization (SSUM) aims to generate human-like summaries from speech. Given variations in information captured and phrasing, recordings can be summarized in multiple ways. Therefore, it is more reasonable to consider a probabilistic distribution of all potential summaries rather than a single summary. However, conventional SSUM models are mostly trained and evaluated with a single ground-truth (GT) human-annotated deterministic summary for every recording. Generating multiple human references would be ideal to better represent the distribution statistically, but is impractical because annotation is expensive. We tackle this challenge by proposing AugSumm, a method to leverage large language models (LLMs) as a proxy for human annotators to generate augmented summaries for training and evaluation. First, we explore prompting strategies to generate synthetic summaries from ChatGPT. We validate the quality of synthetic summaries using multiple metrics including human evaluation, where we find that summaries generated using AugSumm are perceived as more valid to humans. Second, we develop methods to utilize synthetic summaries in training and evaluation. Experiments on How2 demonstrate that pre-training on synthetic summaries and fine-tuning on GT summaries improves ROUGE-L by 1 point on both GT and AugSumm-based test sets.

We propose a plant care conversational dataset named Plantational, which contains around 1K dialogues between users and plant care experts.

We performed an extensive examination (both automated and manual evaluation) of the performance exhibited by various LLMs and VLM in the generation of the domain-specific dialogue responses to underscore the respective strengths and weaknesses of these diverse models.

Participants in the treatment group used ChatGPT in creative tasks, while those in the control group completed the tasks by themselves. The findings show that although the boosting effect of ChatGPT was consistently observed over a five-day creative journey, human creative performance reverted to baseline when ChatGPT was down on the 7th and the 30th day. More critically, the use of ChatGPT in creative tasks resulted in increasingly homogenized contents, and this homogenization effect persisted even when ChatGPT was absence. These findings pose a challenge to the prevailing argument that ChatGPT can enhance human creativity.

As the volume of scientific literature on this topic continues to grow exponentially, manually reviewing these documents has become an immensely challenging task. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze this wealth of information presents an efficient and scalable solution. By gathering extensive amounts of peer-reviewed articles and studies, we can extract and process critical information about the effects of climate change in specific regions. We employ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for Named Entity Recognition (NER), which enables us to efficiently identify specific geographies within the climate literature. This, in turn, facilitates location-specific analyses. We conduct region-specific climate trend analyses to pinpoint the predominant themes or concerns related to climate change within a particular area, trace the temporal progression of these identified issues, and evaluate their frequency, severity, and potential development over time. These in-depth examinations of location-specific climate data enable the creation of more customized policy-making, adaptation, and mitigation strategies, addressing each region's unique challenges and providing more effective solutions rooted in data-driven insights. This approach, founded on a thorough exploration of scientific texts, offers actionable insights to a wide range of stakeholders, from policymakers to engineers to environmentalists. By proactively understanding these impacts, societies are better positioned to prepare, allocate resources wisely, and design tailored strategies to cope with future climate conditions, ensuring a more resilient future for all.

In the context of addressing the multi-modal prompting challenge, we propose Token-wise Adaptive for Multi-modal Prompt Learning (APLe) for tuning both modalities prompts, vision and language, as tokens in a sequential manner. APLe addresses the challenges in V-L models to promote prompt learning across both modalities, which indicates a competitive generalization performance in line with the state-of-the-art.

A synthetic dataset, which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for pre-training on this task. We prove in experiments that LLMs benefit from the pre-training on other tasks.

Our experiments cover thirteen consumer health prediction tasks in mental health, activity, metabolic, sleep, and cardiac assessment. Our fine-tuned model, Health-Alpaca exhibits comparable performance to larger models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), achieving the best performance in 5 out of 13 tasks. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of context enhancement strategies, and generalization capability of the fine-tuned models across training datasets and the size of training samples. Notably, we observe that our context enhancement can yield up to 23.8% improvement in performance. While constructing contextually rich prompts (combining user context, health knowledge and temporal information) exhibits synergistic improvement, the inclusion of health knowledge context in prompts significantly enhances overall performance.

        "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective for misinformation detection. However, the choice of LLMs for experiments varies widely, leading to uncertain conclusions. In particular, GPT-4 is known to be strong in this domain, but it is closed source, potentially expensive, and can show instability between different versions. Meanwhile, alternative LLMs have given mixed results. In this work, we show that Zephyr-7b presents a consistently viable alternative, overcoming key limitations of commonly used approaches like Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. This provides the research community with a solid open-source option and shows open-source models are gradually catching up on this task. We then highlight how GPT-3.5 exhibits unstable performance, such that this very widely used model could provide misleading results in misinformation detection. Finally, we validate new tools including approaches to structured output and the latest version of GPT-4 (Turbo), showing they do not compromise performance, thus unlocking them for future research and potentially enabling more complex pipelines for misinformation mitigation.

        "abstract": "Decoding the core of procedural texts, exemplified by cooking recipes, is crucial for intelligent reasoning and instruction automation. Procedural texts can be comprehensively defined as a sequential chain of steps to accomplish a task employing resources. From a cooking perspective, these instructions can be interpreted as a series of modifications to a food preparation, which initially comprises a set of ingredients. These changes involve transformations of comestible resources. For a model to effectively reason about cooking recipes, it must accurately discern and understand the inputs and outputs of intermediate steps within the recipe. Aiming to address this, we present a new corpus of cooking recipes enriched with descriptions of intermediate steps of the recipes that explicate the input and output for each step. We discuss the data collection process, investigate and provide baseline models based on T5 and GPT-3.5. This work presents a challenging task and insight into commonsense reasoning and procedural text generation. "

        "abstract": "Authors seeking to communicate with broader audiences often compose their ideas about the same underlying knowledge in different documents and formats -- for example, as slide decks, newsletters, reports, brochures, etc. Prior work in document generation has generally considered the creation of each separate format to be different a task, developing independent methods for generation and evaluation. This approach is suboptimal for the advancement of AI-supported content authoring from both research and application perspectives because it leads to fragmented learning processes, redundancy in models and methods, and disjointed evaluation. Thus, in our work, we consider each of these documents to be templatic views of the same underlying knowledge, and we aim to unify the generation and evaluation of these templatic views of documents. We begin by introducing an LLM-powered method to extract the most important information from an input document and represent this information in a structured format. We show that this unified representation can be used to generate multiple templatic views with no supervision and with very little guidance, improving over strong baselines. We additionally introduce a unified evaluation method that is template agnostic, and can be adapted to building document generators for heterogeneous downstream applications. Finally, we conduct a human evaluation, which shows that humans prefer 82% of the downstream documents generated with our method. Furthermore, the newly proposed evaluation metric correlates more highly with human judgement than prior metrics, while providing a unified evaluation method. "

        "abstract": "In engineering design, navigating complex decision-making landscapes demands a thorough exploration of the design, performance, and constraint spaces, often impeded by resource-intensive simulations. Data-driven methods can mitigate this challenge by harnessing historical data to delineate feasible domains, accelerate optimization, or evaluate designs. However, the implementation of these methods usually demands machine-learning expertise and multiple trials to choose the right method and hyperparameters. This makes them less accessible for numerous engineering situations. Additionally, there is an inherent trade-off between training speed and accuracy, with faster methods sometimes compromising precision. In our paper, we demonstrate that a recently released general-purpose transformer-based classification model, TabPFN, is both fast and accurate. Notably, it requires no dataset-specific training to assess new tabular data. TabPFN is a Prior-Data Fitted Network, which undergoes a one-time offline training across a broad spectrum of synthetic datasets and performs in-context learning. We evaluated TabPFN's efficacy across eight engineering design classification problems, contrasting it with seven other algorithms, including a state-of-the-art AutoML method. For these classification challenges, TabPFN consistently outperforms in speed and accuracy. It is also the most data-efficient and provides the added advantage of being differentiable and giving uncertainty estimates. Our findings advocate for the potential of pre-trained models that learn from synthetic data and require no domain-specific tuning to make data-driven engineering design accessible to a broader community and open ways to efficient general-purpose models valid across applications. Furthermore, we share a benchmark problem set for evaluating new classification algorithms in engineering design. "

        "abstract": "Chemistry experimentation is often resource- and labor-intensive. Despite the many benefits incurred by the integration of advanced and special-purpose lab equipment, many aspects of experimentation are still manually conducted by chemists, for example, polishing an electrode in electrochemistry experiments. Traditional lab automation infrastructure faces challenges when it comes to flexibly adapting to new chemistry experiments. To address this issue, we propose a human-friendly and flexible robotic system, ORGANA, that automates a diverse set of chemistry experiments. It is capable of interacting with chemists in the lab through natural language, using Large Language Models (LLMs). ORGANA keeps scientists informed by providing timely reports that incorporate statistical analyses. Additionally, it actively engages with users when necessary for disambiguation or troubleshooting. ORGANA can reason over user input to derive experiment goals, and plan long sequences of both high-level tasks and low-level robot actions while using feedback from the visual perception of the environment. It also supports scheduling and parallel execution for experiments that require resource allocation and coordination between multiple robots and experiment stations. We show that ORGANA successfully conducts a diverse set of chemistry experiments, including solubility assessment, pH measurement, recrystallization, and electrochemistry experiments. For the latter, we show that ORGANA robustly executes a long-horizon plan, comprising 19 steps executed in parallel, to characterize the electrochemical properties of quinone derivatives, a class of molecules used in rechargeable flow batteries. Our user study indicates that ORGANA significantly improves many aspects of user experience while reducing their physical workload.

Existing long-context extension methods usually need additional training procedures to support corresponding long-context windows, where the long-context training data (e.g., 32k) is needed, and high GPU training costs are assumed. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an Efficient and Extreme length extension method for Large Language Models, called E 2 -LLM, with only one training procedure and dramatically reduced computation cost, which also removes the need to collect long-context data. Concretely, first, the training data of our E 2 -LLM only requires a short length (e.g., 4k), which reduces the tuning cost greatly. Second, the training procedure on the short training context window is performed only once time, and we can support different evaluation context windows at inference. Third, in E 2 - LLM, based on RoPE position embeddings, we introduce two different augmentation methods on the scale and position index parameters for different samples in training. It aims to make the model more robust to the different relative differences when directly interpolating the arbitrary context length at inference. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our E 2 -LLM on challenging long-context tasks. "

However, the relationship between retrievers and LLMs is still under-investigated. Most existing work treats the retriever and the LLM as independent components and leaves a gap between retrieving human-friendly information and assembling a LLM-friendly context. In this work, we examine a novel bridge model, validate the ranking and selection assumptions in retrievers in the context of RAG, and propose a training framework that chains together supervised and reinforcement learning to learn a bridge model. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both question-answering and personalized generation tasks. "

In recent years, the Transformer has witnessed remarkable advancements in computer vision, prompting an increasing body of research to delve into the application of Transformer in Re-ID. This paper provides a comprehensive review and in-depth analysis of the Transformer-based Re-ID. In categorizing existing works into Image/Video-Based Re-ID, Re-ID with limited data/annotations, Cross-Modal Re-ID, and Special Re-ID Scenarios, we thoroughly elucidate the advantages demonstrated by the Transformer in addressing a multitude of challenges across these domains.

Besides, this survey also covers a wide range of Re-ID research objects, including progress in animal Re-ID. Given the diversity of species in animal Re-ID, we devise a standardized experimental benchmark and conduct extensive experiments to explore the applicability of Transformer for this task to facilitate future research. Finally, we discuss some important yet under-investigated open issues in the big foundation model era, we believe it will serve as a new handbook for researchers in this field. "

However it has not been clear how they would fare on more challenging competition-level problems. And while self-generated verbalizations of intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., chain-of-thought prompting) have been shown to be helpful, whether LLMs can make use of helpful side information such as problem-specific hints has not been investigated before. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset for enabling such analyses. The Concept and Hint-Annotated Math Problems (CHAMP) consists of high school math competition problems, annotated with concepts, or general math facts, and hints, or problem-specific tricks. These annotations allow us to explore the effects of additional information, such as relevant hints, misleading concepts, or related problems. This benchmark is difficult, with the best model only scoring 58.1% in standard settings. With concepts and hints, performance sometimes improves, indicating that some models can make use of such side information. We further annotate model-generated solutions for their correctness. Using this corpus, we find that models often arrive at the correct final answer through wrong reasoning steps. In addition, we test whether models are able to verify these solutions, and find that most models struggle. The dataset and code are available on the project website. "

However, LVDs often struggle in recognizing the located objects due to domain discrepancy in data distribution and object vocabulary. At the other end, recent vision-language foundation models such as CLIP demonstrate superior open-vocabulary recognition capability. This paper presents KGD, a Knowledge Graph Distillation technique that exploits the implicit knowledge graphs (KG) in CLIP for effectively adapting LVDs to various downstream domains. KGD consists of two consecutive stages: 1) KG extraction that employs CLIP to encode downstream domain data as nodes and their feature distances as edges, constructing KG that inherits the rich semantic relations in CLIP explicitly; and 2) KG encapsulation that transfers the extracted KG into LVDs to enable accurate cross-domain object classification. In addition, KGD can extract both visual and textual KG independently, providing complementary vision and language knowledge for object localization and object classification in detection tasks over various downstream domains. Experiments over multiple widely adopted detection benchmarks show that KGD outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins. "

        "abstract": "We present ENTED, a new framework for blind face restoration that aims to restore high-quality and realistic portrait images. Our method involves repairing a single degraded input image using a high-quality reference image. We utilize a texture extraction and distribution framework to transfer high-quality texture features between the degraded input and reference image. However, the StyleGAN-like architecture in our framework requires high-quality latent codes to generate realistic images. The latent code extracted from the degraded input image often contains corrupted features, making it difficult to align the semantic information from the input with the high-quality textures from the reference. To overcome this challenge, we employ two special techniques. The first technique, inspired by vector quantization, replaces corrupted semantic features with high-quality code words. The second technique generates style codes that carry photorealistic texture information from a more informative latent space developed using the high-quality features in the reference image's manifold. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method produces results with more realistic contextual details and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. A thorough ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each proposed module. "

Most studies alleviate the noise issues from data cleaning perspective such as data resampling and reweighting, but they are constrained by heuristic assumptions. Another denoising avenue is from model perspective, which proactively injects noises into user-item interactions and enhance the intrinsic denoising ability of models. However, this kind of denoising process poses significant challenges to the recommender model's representation capacity to capture noise patterns. To address this issue, we propose Denoising Diffusion Recommender Model (DDRM), which leverages multi-step denoising process based on diffusion models to robustify user and item embeddings from any recommender models. DDRM injects controlled Gaussian noises in the forward process and iteratively removes noises in the reverse denoising process, thereby improving embedding robustness against noisy feedback. To achieve this target, the key lies in offering appropriate guidance to steer the reverse denoising process and providing a proper starting point to start the forward-reverse process during inference. In particular, we propose a dedicated denoising module that encodes collaborative information as denoising guidance. Besides, in the inference stage, DDRM utilizes the average embeddings of users' historically liked items as the starting point rather than using pure noise since pure noise lacks personalization, which increases the difficulty of the denoising process.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability beyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in downstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend LLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and GPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are resource-intensive and lack comparative experiments to assess their applicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention entropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain stability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting RoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently adapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in both fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window sizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6 training steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore how data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension for specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy conversations as a good starting point.

Many recent studies focus on enhancing the capabilities of smaller models through knowledge distillation from closed-source language models. However, due to the incapability to directly access the weights, hidden states, and output distributions of these closed-source models, the distillation can only be performed by fine-tuning smaller models with data samples generated by closed-source language models, which constrains the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. In this paper, we propose to estimate the output distributions of closed-source language models within a Bayesian estimation framework, involving both prior and posterior estimation. The prior estimation aims to derive a prior distribution by utilizing the corpus generated by closed-source language models, while the posterior estimation employs a proxy model to update the prior distribution and derive a posterior distribution. By leveraging the estimated output distribution of closed-source language models, traditional knowledge distillation can be executed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of current models directly fine-tuned on data generated by closed-source language models. "

        "abstract": "With the recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), generating functionally correct code has become less complicated for a wide array of developers. While using LLMs has sped up the functional development process, it poses a heavy risk to code security. Code generation with proper security measures using LLM is a significantly more challenging task than functional code generation. Security measures may include adding a pair of lines of code with the original code, consisting of null pointer checking or prepared statements for SQL injection prevention. Currently, available code repair LLMs generate code repair by supervised fine-tuning, where the model looks at cross-entropy loss. However, the original and repaired codes are mostly similar in functionality and syntactically, except for a few (1-2) lines, which act as security measures. This imbalance between the lines needed for security measures and the functional code enforces the supervised fine-tuned model to prioritize generating functional code without adding proper security measures, which also benefits the model by resulting in minimal loss. Therefore, in this work, for security hardening and strengthening of generated code from LLMs, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method for program-specific repair with the combination of semantic and syntactic reward mechanisms that focus heavily on adding security and functional measures in the code, respectively.

While advanced end-to-end trainable methods have shown commendable performance, the pursuit of multi-task optimization may pose the risk of producing sub-optimal outcomes for individual tasks. In this paper, we highlight a main bottleneck in the state-of-the-art video text spotter: the limited recognition capability. In response to this issue, we propose to efficiently turn an off-the-shelf query-based image text spotter into a specialist on video and present a simple baseline termed GoMatching, which focuses the training efforts on tracking while maintaining strong recognition performance. To adapt the image text spotter to video datasets, we add a rescoring head to rescore each detected instance's confidence via efficient tuning, leading to a better tracking candidate pool. Additionally, we design a long-short term matching module, termed LST-Matcher, to enhance the spotter's tracking capability by integrating both long- and short-term matching results via Transformer. Based on the above simple designs, GoMatching achieves impressive performance on two public benchmarks, e.g., setting a new record on the ICDAR15-video dataset, and one novel test set with arbitrary-shaped text, while saving considerable training budgets.

We find that the smoothness of surrogate models at different time steps differs, and we substantially improve the performance of the MC-based AEs by selecting smoother surrogate models. In the light of the theoretical framework on adversarial transferability in image classification, we also conduct a theoretical analysis to explain why smooth surrogate models can also boost AEs for LDMs. "

We also present a demonstration-level variant of LLM GP and share its code. By addressing algorithms that range from the formal to hands-on, we cover design and LLM-usage considerations as well as the scientific challenges that arise when using an LLM for genetic programming.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07115",
        "abstract": "The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology, leading to a proliferation of computational agents. Scholars have been studying the inherent personalities displayed by LLM agents and attempting to incorporate human traits and behaviors into them. However, these efforts have primarily focused on commercially-licensed LLMs, neglecting the widespread use and notable advancements seen in Open LLMs. This work aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive examination of the ability of agents to emulate human personalities using Open LLMs. To achieve this, we generate a set of ten LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models and subject them to a series of assessments concerning the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of Open LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that: $(i)$ each Open LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; $(ii)$ personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); $(iii)$ combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities; and $(iv)$ personalities typically associated with the role of teacher tend to be emulated with greater accuracy. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of Open LLMs. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07159",
        "abstract": "Finetuning large language models (LLMs) has been empirically effective on a variety of downstream tasks. Existing approaches to finetuning an LLM either focus on parameter-efficient finetuning, which only updates a small number of trainable parameters, or attempt to reduce the memory footprint during the training phase of the finetuning. Typically, the memory footprint during finetuning stems from three contributors: model weights, optimizer states, and intermediate activations. However, existing works still require considerable memory and none can simultaneously mitigate memory footprint for all three sources. In this paper, we present Quantized Side Tuing (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process. First, QST quantizes an LLM's model weights into 4-bit to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's original weights; QST also introduces a side network separated from the LLM, which utilizes the hidden states of the LLM to make task-specific predictions. Using a separate side network avoids performing backpropagation through the LLM, thus reducing the memory requirement of the intermediate activations. Furthermore, QST leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states. Experiments show that QST can reduce the total memory footprint by up to 2.3 $\\times$ and speed up the finetuning process by up to 3 $\\times$ while achieving competent performance compared with the state-of-the-art. When it comes to full finetuning, QST can reduce the total memory footprint up to 7 $\\times$. "

Goal misgeneralization, a type of robustness failure in RL occurs when an agent retains its capabilities out-of-distribution yet pursues a proxy rather than the intended one. Our approach utilizes LLMs to analyze an RL agent's policies during training and identify potential failure scenarios. The RL agent is then deployed in these scenarios, and a reward model is learnt through the LLM preferences and feedback. This LLM-informed reward model is used to further train the RL agent on the original dataset. We apply our method to a maze navigation task, and show marked improvements in goal generalization, especially in cases where true and proxy goals are somewhat distinguishable and behavioral biases are pronounced. This study demonstrates how the LLM, despite its lack of task proficiency, can efficiently supervise RL agents, providing scalable oversight and valuable insights for enhancing goal-directed learning in RL through the use of LLMs. "

The similarity between these intermediate left-right features significantly impacts the accuracy of disparity estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial attack approach that generates perturbation noise specifically designed to maximize the discrepancy between left and right image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of our method to induce larger prediction errors in stereo neural networks, e.g. outperforming existing state-of-the-art attack methods by 219% MAE on the KITTI dataset and 85% MAE on the Scene Flow dataset. Additionally, we extend our approach to include a proxy network black-box attack method, eliminating the need for access to stereo neural network. This method leverages an arbitrary network from a different vision task as a proxy to generate adversarial noise, effectively causing the stereo network to produce erroneous predictions. Our findings highlight a notable sensitivity of stereo networks to discrepancies in shallow layer features, offering valuable insights that could guide future research in enhancing the robustness of stereo vision systems.

        "abstract": "This work finds limited evidence supporting the theory that using multiple tasks with sequence-to-sequence transformer language models can improve performance on some metrics. In particular, the multi-task generalist t5-small outperforms the specialist t5-small with a $F_1$ of $0.771$ up from $0.692$, which may point to underlying cross-task knowledge generalization. This further suggests that even with the same network, \"re-using\" the same data in a different way may lead to higher performance in some metrics. However, the inverse task alone is likely only an optimization strategy, since it does not yield a significant general improvement at the model sizes explored in this work. Also, adding $\\approx 4500$ LLM annotated records (interlaced with the $12800$ WebNLG training records) does not substantially change automatic metric performance compared to the same t5-small model without the synthetic data. This may be due to a learning capacity bottleneck on account of model size, and decreases observed may be due to distributional differences in the corpora. Future research using larger models or human evaluation is required to more fully explain the mechanisms contributing to performance on these tasks. "

Building such models requires availability of abundant high-quality event sequence data. In certain applications, however, clean structured event sequences are not available, and automated sequence extraction results in data that is too noisy and incomplete. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate event sequences that can effectively be used for probabilistic event model construction. This can be viewed as a mechanism of distilling event sequence knowledge from LLMs. Our approach relies on a Knowledge Graph (KG) of event concepts with partial causal relations to guide the generative language model for causal event sequence generation. We show that our approach can generate high-quality event sequences, filling a knowledge gap in the input KG. Furthermore, we explore how the generated sequences can be leveraged to discover useful and more complex structured knowledge from pattern mining and probabilistic event models. We release our sequence generation code and evaluation framework, as well as corpus of event sequence data. "

        "abstract": "3D landmark detection plays a pivotal role in various applications such as 3D registration, pose estimation, and virtual try-on. While considerable success has been achieved in 2D human landmark detection or pose estimation, there is a notable scarcity of reported works on landmark detection in unordered 3D point clouds. This paper introduces a novel challenge, namely 3D landmark detection on human point clouds, presenting two primary contributions. Firstly, we establish a comprehensive human point cloud dataset, named HPoint103, designed to support the 3D landmark detection community. This dataset comprises 103 human point clouds created with commercial software and actors, each manually annotated with 11 stable landmarks. Secondly, we propose a Dual Cascade Point Transformer (D-CPT) model for precise point-based landmark detection. D-CPT gradually refines the landmarks through cascade Transformer decoder layers across the entire point cloud stream, simultaneously enhancing landmark coordinates with a RefineNet over local regions. Comparative evaluations with popular point-based methods on HPoint103 and the public dataset DHP19 demonstrate the dramatic outperformance of our D-CPT. Additionally, the integration of our RefineNet into existing methods consistently improves performance. "

        "abstract": "Molecular communications is a technique emulated by researchers, which has already been used by the nature for millions of years. In Molecular Communications via Diffusion (MCvD), messenger molecules are emitted by a transmitter and propagate in the fluidic environment in a random manner. In biological systems, the environment can be considered a bounded space, surrounded by different structures, such as tissues and organs. The propagation of molecules is affected by these structures in the environment, which reflect the molecules upon collision. Hence, understanding the behavior of MCvD systems near reflecting surfaces is important for modeling molecular communication systems analytically. However, deriving the channel response of MCvD systems with an absorbing spherical receiver requires solving the diffusion equation in 3-D space in the presence of a reflecting boundary, which is extremely challenging. Therefore, derivation of the channel response in a bounded environment has remained one of the unanswered questions in the literature. In this paper, a method to model molecular communication systems near reflecting surfaces is proposed, and an analytical closed-form solution for the channel response is derived. "

Furthermore, the question and answer pairs are extracted directly from the corpus in predefined formats offers limited context. To address this limitation, we improve reading comprehension via LLM and clustering. LLM focuses on leveraging domain knowledge within the corpus to refine comprehension stage, while clustering supplies relevant knowledge by extending the context to enrich reading stage. Additionally, our method incorporates parameter-efficient fine-tuning to improve the efficiency of domain adaptation. In comparison to AdaptLLM, our method achieves an improvement exceeding 5% in domain-specific tasks. Our code will available at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps. "

        "abstract": "Generative Language Models (LMs) such as ChatGPT have exhibited remarkable performance across various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, one of their most prominent drawbacks is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. Previous studies have devised sophisticated pipelines and prompts to induce large LMs to exhibit the capability for self-correction. However, large LMs are explicitly prompted to verify and modify its answers separately rather than completing all steps spontaneously like humans. Moreover, these complex prompts are extremely challenging for small LMs to follow. In this paper, we introduce the \\underline{I}ntrinsic \\underline{S}elf-\\underline{C}orrection (ISC) in generative language models, aiming to correct the initial output of LMs in a self-triggered manner, even for those small LMs with 6 billion parameters. Specifically, we devise a pipeline for constructing self-correction data and propose Partial Answer Masking (PAM), aiming to endow the model with the capability for intrinsic self-correction through fine-tuning. We conduct experiments using LMs with parameters sizes ranging from 6 billion to 13 billion in two tasks, including commonsense reasoning and factual knowledge reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that the outputs generated using ISC outperform those generated without self-correction. We believe that the output quality of even small LMs can be further improved by empowering them with the ability to intrinsic self-correct. "

This work focuses on early detection of depression, particularly in extroverted social media users, using LLMs such as GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and our proposed GPT 3.5 fine-tuned model DepGPT, as well as advanced Deep learning models(LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, BiGRU) and Transformer models(BERT, BanglaBERT, SahajBERT, BanglaBERT-Base). The study categorized Reddit and X datasets into \"Depressive\" and \"Non-Depressive\" segments, translated into Bengali by native speakers with expertise in mental health, resulting in the creation of the Bengali Social Media Depressive Dataset (BSMDD).

However, existing zero-shot agents for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) only prompt the GPT to handle excessive environmental information and select potential locations within localized environments, without constructing an effective ''global-view'' (e.g., a commonly-used map) for the agent to understand the overall environment. In this work, we present a novel map-guided GPT-based path-planning agent, dubbed MapGPT, for the zero-shot VLN task. Specifically, we convert a topological map constructed online into prompts to encourage map-guided global exploration, and require the agent to explicitly output and update multi-step path planning to avoid getting stuck in local exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MapGPT is effective, achieving impressive performance on both the R2R and REVERIE datasets (38.8% and 28.4% success rate, respectively) and showcasing the newly emerged global thinking and path planning capabilities of the GPT model. Unlike previous VLN agents, which require separate parameters fine-tuning or specific prompt design to accommodate various instruction styles across different datasets, our MapGPT is more unified as it can adapt to different instruction styles seamlessly, which is the first of its kind in this field.

        "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete complex tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers but also excel in task planning, memory management, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional approaches focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. Moreover, the entire LLM may require retraining when tools are updated. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel strategy that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with other components to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning.

        "abstract": "The absence of robust security protocols renders the VANET (Vehicle ad-hoc Networks) network open to cyber threats by compromising passengers and road safety. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely employed to detect network security threats. With vehicles' high mobility on the road and diverse environments, VANETs devise ever-changing network topologies, lack privacy and security, and have limited bandwidth efficiency. The absence of privacy precautions, End-to-End Encryption methods, and Local Data Processing systems in VANET also present many privacy and security difficulties. So, assessing whether a novel real-time processing IDS approach can be utilized for this emerging technology is crucial. The present study introduces a novel approach for intrusion detection using Federated Learning (FL) capabilities in conjunction with the BERT model for sequence classification (FL-BERT). The significance of data privacy is duly recognized. According to FL methodology, each client has its own local model and dataset. They train their models locally and then send the model's weights to the server. After aggregation, the server aggregates the weights from all clients to update a global model. After aggregation, the global model's weights are shared with the clients. This practice guarantees the secure storage of sensitive raw data on individual clients' devices, effectively protecting privacy. After conducting the federated learning procedure, we assessed our models' performance using a separate test dataset. The FL-BERT technique has yielded promising results, opening avenues for further investigation in this particular area of research. We reached the result of our approaches by comparing existing research works and found that FL-BERT is more effective for privacy and security concerns. Our results suggest that FL-BERT is a promising technique for enhancing attack detection. "

        "abstract": "Human annotation of training samples is expensive, laborious, and sometimes challenging, especially for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. To reduce the labeling cost and enhance the sample efficiency, Active Learning (AL) technique can be used to label as few samples as possible to reach a reasonable or similar results. To reduce even more costs and with the significant advances of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLMs can be a good candidate to annotate samples. This work investigates the accuracy and cost of using LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to label samples on 3 different datasets. A consistency-based strategy is proposed to select samples that are potentially incorrectly labeled so that human annotations can be used for those samples in AL settings, and we call it mixed annotation strategy. Then we test performance of AL under two different settings: (1) using human annotations only; (2) using the proposed mixed annotation strategy. The accuracy of AL models under 3 AL query strategies are reported on 3 text classification datasets, i.e., AG's News, TREC-6, and Rotten Tomatoes. On AG's News and Rotten Tomatoes, the models trained with the mixed annotation strategy achieves similar or better results compared to that with human annotations.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can align language models with non-differentiable reward signals, such as human preferences. However, a major challenge arises from the sparsity of these reward signals - typically, there is only one reward for the entire generation. This sparsity of rewards can lead to inefficient and unstable learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework leveraging the critique ability of LLMs to produce dense rewards throughout the learning process. Our approach incorporates a critic language model alongside the policy model. This critic is prompted with the task description, question, policy model's output, and environment's reward signal as input, and provides token or span-level dense rewards that reflect the quality of each segment of the output. We assess our approach on three text generation tasks: sentiment control, language model detoxification, and summarization. Experimental results show that incorporating artificial dense rewards in training yields consistent performance gains over the PPO baseline with holistic rewards. Furthermore, in a setting where the same model serves as both policy and critic, we demonstrate that \"self-critique\" rewards also boost learning efficiency. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07408",
        "abstract": "Adsorption energy, a reactivity descriptor, should be accurately assessed for efficient catalyst screening. This evaluation requires determining the lowest energy across various adsorption configurations on the catalytic surface. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a machine learning approach for computing the energy of catalyst systems, they rely heavily on atomic spatial coordinates and often lack clarity in their interpretations. Recent advancements in language models have broadened their applicability to predicting catalytic properties, allowing us to bypass the complexities of graph representation. These models are adept at handling textual data, making it possible to incorporate observable features in a human-readable format. However, language models encounter challenges in accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations, typically showing a high mean absolute error (MAE) of about 0.71 eV. Our study addresses this limitation by introducing a self-supervised multi-modal learning approach, termed graph-assisted pretraining. This method significantly reduces the MAE to 0.35 eV through a combination of data augmentation, achieving comparable accuracy with DimeNet++ while using 0.4% of its training data size. Furthermore, the Transformer encoder at the core of the language model can provide insights into the feature focus through its attention scores. This analysis shows that our multimodal training effectively redirects the model's attention toward relevant adsorption configurations from adsorbate-related features, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.

        "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has exhibited remarkable efficacy in establishing cross-modal connections between texts and images, yielding impressive performance across a broad spectrum of downstream applications through fine-tuning. However, for generalization tasks, the current fine-tuning methods for CLIP, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, demonstrate relatively low performance on some fine-grained datasets. We recognize the underlying reason is that these previous methods only projected global features into the prompt, neglecting the various visual concepts, such as colors, shapes, and sizes, which are naturally transferable across domains and play a crucial role in generalization tasks. To address this issue, in this work, we propose Concept-Guided Prompt Learning (CPL) for vision-language models. Specifically, we leverage the well-learned knowledge of CLIP to create a visual concept cache to enable concept-guided prompting. In order to refine the text features, we further develop a projector that transforms multi-level visual features into text features. We observe that this concept-guided prompt learning approach is able to achieve enhanced consistency between visual and linguistic modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CPL method significantly improves generalization capabilities compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. "

        "abstract": "Most existing methods tackle the problem of occluded person re-identification (ReID) by utilizing auxiliary models, resulting in a complicated and inefficient ReID framework that is unacceptable for real-time applications. In this work, a speed-up person ReID framework named SUReID is proposed to mitigate occlusion interference while speeding up inference. The SUReID consists of three key components: hierarchical token sparsification (HTS) strategy, non-parametric feature alignment knowledge distillation (NPKD), and noise occlusion data augmentation (NODA). The HTS strategy works by pruning the redundant tokens in the vision transformer to achieve highly effective self-attention computation and eliminate interference from occlusions or background noise. However, the pruned tokens may contain human part features that contaminate the feature representation and degrade the performance. To solve this problem, the NPKD is employed to supervise the HTS strategy, retaining more discriminative tokens and discarding meaningless ones. Furthermore, the NODA is designed to introduce more noisy samples, which further trains the ability of the HTS to disentangle different tokens. Experimental results show that the SUReID achieves superior performance with surprisingly fast inference. "

        "abstract": "Enabling robotic manipulation that generalizes to out-of-distribution scenes is a crucial step toward open-world embodied intelligence. For human beings, this ability is rooted in the understanding of semantic correspondence among objects, which naturally transfers the interaction experience of familiar objects to novel ones. Although robots lack such a reservoir of interaction experience, the vast availability of human videos on the Internet may serve as a valuable resource, from which we extract an affordance memory including the contact points. Inspired by the natural way humans think, we propose Robo-ABC: when confronted with unfamiliar objects that require generalization, the robot can acquire affordance by retrieving objects that share visual or semantic similarities from the affordance memory. The next step is to map the contact points of the retrieved objects to the new object. While establishing this correspondence may present formidable challenges at first glance, recent research finds it naturally arises from pre-trained diffusion models, enabling affordance mapping even across disparate object categories. Through the Robo-ABC framework, robots may generalize to manipulate out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner without any manual annotation, additional training, part segmentation, pre-coded knowledge, or viewpoint restrictions. Quantitatively, Robo-ABC significantly enhances the accuracy of visual affordance retrieval by a large margin of 31.6% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end affordance models. We also conduct real-world experiments of cross-category object-grasping tasks. Robo-ABC achieved a success rate of 85.7%, proving its capacity for real-world tasks. "

        "abstract": "There is a class of problems that exhibit smooth behavior on macroscopic scales, where only a microscopic evolution law is known. Patch dynamics scheme of `equation-free multiscale modelling' is one of the techniques, which aims to extract the macroscopic information using such known time-dependent microscopic model simulation in patches (which is a fraction of the space-time domain) that reduces the computational complexity. Here, extrapolation time step has an important role to reduce the error at macroscopic level. In this study, a generalized patch dynamics (GPD) scheme is proposed by distributing the gap-tooth timesteppers (GTTs) within each long (macroscopic) time step. This distribution is done in two ways, namely, GPD schemes of type-I and type-II. The proposed GPD scheme is based on three different time scales namely, micro, meso and macro to predict the system level behaviours. The GPD scheme of both types are capable of providing better accuracy with less computation time compared to the usual patch dynamics (UPD) scheme. The physical behaviours of the problems can be more appropriately addressed by the GPD scheme as one may use a non-uniform (variable) distribution of gap-tooth timesteppers (GTTs), as well as the extrapolation times based on the physics of the problem. Where the UPD scheme fails to converge for a long extrapolation time, both types of GPD schemes can be successfully applied. The whole method has been analyzed successfully for the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion problem. "

Yet, their real-world applicability is hindered by high storage demands, lengthy fine-tuning processes, and the need for multiple reference images. Conversely, existing ID embedding-based methods, while requiring only a single forward inference, face challenges: they either necessitate extensive fine-tuning across numerous model parameters, lack compatibility with community pre-trained models, or fail to maintain high face fidelity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce InstantID, a powerful diffusion model-based solution. Our plug-and-play module adeptly handles image personalization in various styles using just a single facial image, while ensuring high fidelity. To achieve this, we design a novel IdentityNet by imposing strong semantic and weak spatial conditions, integrating facial and landmark images with textual prompts to steer the image generation. InstantID demonstrates exceptional performance and efficiency, proving highly beneficial in real-world applications where identity preservation is paramount. Moreover, our work seamlessly integrates with popular pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models like SD1.5 and SDXL, serving as an adaptable plugin.

        "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) editing modifies factual information in LLMs. Locate-and-Edit (L\\&E) methods accomplish this by finding where relevant information is stored within the neural network, and editing the weights at that location. The goal of editing is to modify the response of an LLM to a proposition independently of its phrasing, while not modifying its response to other related propositions. Existing methods are limited to binary propositions, which represent straightforward binary relations between a subject and an object. Furthermore, existing methods rely on semantic subject labels, which may not be available or even be well-defined in practice. In this paper, we show that both of these issues can be effectively skirted with a simple and fast localization method called Gradient Tracing (GT). This localization method allows editing arbitrary propositions instead of just binary ones, and does so without the need for subject labels. As propositions always have a truth value, our experiments prompt an LLM as a boolean classifier, and edit its T/F response to propositions. Our method applies GT for location tracing, and then edit the model at that location using a mild variant of Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). On datasets of binary propositions derived from the CounterFact dataset, we show that our method -- without access to subject labels -- performs close to state-of-the-art L\\&E methods which has access subject labels. We then introduce a new dataset, Factual Accuracy Classification Test (FACT), which includes non-binary propositions and for which subject labels are not generally applicable, and therefore is beyond the scope of existing L\\&E methods. Nevertheless, we show that with our method editing is possible on FACT. "

Current remote sensing foundation models typically specialize in a single modality or a specific spatial resolution range, limiting their versatility for downstream datasets. While there have been attempts to develop multi-modal remote sensing foundation models, they typically employ separate vision encoders for each modality or spatial resolution, necessitating a switch in backbones contingent upon the input data. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method, termed OFA-Net (One-For-All Network): employing a single, shared Transformer backbone for multiple data modalities with different spatial resolutions. Using the masked image modeling mechanism, we pre-train a single Transformer backbone on a curated multi-modal dataset with this simple design. Then the backbone model can be used in different downstream tasks, thus forging a path towards a unified foundation backbone model in Earth vision. The proposed method is evaluated on 12 distinct downstream tasks and demonstrates promising performance. "

To this end, we propose Multi-view MidiVAE, as one of the pioneers in VAE methods that effectively model and generate long multi-track symbolic music. The Multi-view MidiVAE utilizes the two-dimensional (2-D) representation, OctupleMIDI, to capture relationships among notes while reducing the feature sequences length. Moreover, we focus on instrumental characteristics and harmony as well as global and local information about the musical composition by employing a hybrid variational encoding-decoding strategy to integrate both Track- and Bar-view MidiVAE features. Objective and subjective experimental results on the CocoChorales dataset demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, Multi-view MidiVAE exhibits significant improvements in terms of modeling long multi-track symbolic music.

We then sample Gaussian noises to simulate the effects of different contexts when updating LLMs. By such, we can make LLMs see the unseen contexts where the edited knowledge will be applied, therefore improving the editing generalization. Experimental results on three LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and also distinguish our methods from the others of fine-tuning LLMs by noises. "

To attain superior classification performance, we propose to harness the inherent value of multimodal representations by transcribing speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and translating the transcripts into different languages via pretrained translation models. We thus obtain an audio-textual (multimodal) representation for each data sample. Subsequently, we combine language-specific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Wav2Vec2.0 audio features via a novel cascaded cross-modal transformer (CCMT). Our model is based on two cascaded transformer blocks. The first one combines text-specific features from distinct languages, while the second one combines acoustic features with multilingual features previously learned by the first transformer block.

While writing test cases is the centerpiece of TDD, it is time-consuming, expensive, and often shunned by developers. To address these issues associated with TDD, automated test case generation approaches have recently been investigated. Such approaches take source code as input, but not the requirements. Therefore, existing work does not fully support true TDD, as actual code is required to generate test cases. In addition, current deep learning-based test case generation approaches are trained with one learning objective, i.e., to generate test cases that are exactly matched with the ground-truth test cases. However, such approaches may limit the model's ability to generate different yet correct test cases. In this paper, we introduce PyTester, a Text-to-Testcase generation approach that can automatically generate syntactically correct, executable, complete, and effective test cases while being aligned with a given natural language requirement. We evaluate PyTester on the public APPS benchmark dataset, and the results show that our Deep RL approach enables PyTester, a small language model, to outperform much larger language models like GPT3.5, StarCoder, and InCoder.

Prior work on multilingual evaluation has shown that there is a large gap between the performance of LLMs on English and other languages.

In this work, we finetune the LLaMA-7B and Mistral-7B models on synthetic multilingual instruction tuning data to determine its effect on model performance on five downstream tasks covering twenty three languages in all. Additionally, we experiment with various parameters, such as rank for low-rank adaptation and values of quantisation to determine their effects on downstream performance and find that higher rank and higher quantisation values benefit low-resource languages. We find that parameter efficient finetuning of smaller open source models sometimes bridges the gap between the performance of these models and the larger ones, however, English performance can take a hit.

And the pooled image and text features, ends up acting as a bag of words, hence losing the syntactic information. In this work, we ask: Is it possible to enhance CLIP's fine-grained and syntactic abilities without compromising its semantic properties? We show that this is possible by adapting CLIP efficiently on a high-quality, comprehensive, and relatively small dataset. We demonstrate our adaptation strategy on VidSitu, a video situation recognition dataset annotated with verbs and rich semantic role labels (SRL). We use the SRL and verb information to create rule-based detailed captions, making sure they capture most of the visual concepts. Combined with hard negatives and hierarchical losses, these annotations allow us to learn a powerful visual representation, dubbed Fine-Grained CLIP (FiGCLIP), that preserves semantic understanding while being detail-oriented. We evaluate on five diverse vision-language tasks in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, achieving consistent improvements over the base CLIP model. "

        "abstract": "We present our vision for developing an automated tool capable of translating visual properties observed in Machine Learning (ML) visualisations into Python assertions. The tool aims to streamline the process of manually verifying these visualisations in the ML development cycle, which is critical as real-world data and assumptions often change post-deployment. In a prior study, we mined $54,070$ Jupyter notebooks from Github and created a catalogue of $269$ semantically related visualisation-assertion (VA) pairs. Building on this catalogue, we propose to build a taxonomy that organises the VA pairs based on ML verification tasks. The input feature space comprises of a rich source of information mined from the Jupyter notebooks -- visualisations, Python source code, and associated markdown text. The effectiveness of various AI models, including traditional NLP4Code models and modern Large Language Models, will be compared using established machine translation metrics and evaluated through a qualitative study with human participants. The paper also plans to address the challenge of extending the existing VA pair dataset with additional pairs from Kaggle and to compare the tool's effectiveness with commercial generative AI models like ChatGPT. This research not only contributes to the field of ML system validation but also explores novel ways to leverage AI for automating and enhancing software engineering practices in ML. "

In addition, it has been shown that we can elicit attempts at grammatical error correction (GEC) from LLMs when prompted with ungrammatical input sentences. We evaluate how well LLMs can perform at GEC by measuring their performance on established benchmark datasets. We go beyond previous studies, which only examined GPT* models on a selection of English GEC datasets, by evaluating seven open-source and three commercial LLMs on four established GEC benchmarks. We investigate model performance and report results against individual error types. Our results indicate that LLMs do not always outperform supervised English GEC models except in specific contexts -- namely commercial LLMs on benchmarks annotated with fluency corrections as opposed to minimal edits. We find that several open-source models outperform commercial ones on minimal edit benchmarks, and that in some settings zero-shot prompting is just as competitive as few-shot prompting. "

        "abstract": "Diffusion-based Image Editing (DIE) is an emerging research hot-spot, which often applies a semantic mask to control the target area for diffusion-based editing. However, most existing solutions obtain these masks via manual operations or off-line processing, greatly reducing their efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient image editing method for Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models, termed Instant Diffusion Editing(InstDiffEdit). In particular, InstDiffEdit aims to employ the cross-modal attention ability of existing diffusion models to achieve instant mask guidance during the diffusion steps. To reduce the noise of attention maps and realize the full automatics, we equip InstDiffEdit with a training-free refinement scheme to adaptively aggregate the attention distributions for the automatic yet accurate mask generation. Meanwhile, to supplement the existing evaluations of DIE, we propose a new benchmark called Editing-Mask to examine the mask accuracy and local editing ability of existing methods. To validate InstDiffEdit, we also conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and Imagen, and compare it with a bunch of the SOTA methods. The experimental results show that InstDiffEdit not only outperforms the SOTA methods in both image quality and editing results, but also has a much faster inference speed, i.e., +5 to +6 times.

        "abstract": "We present a novel graph Transformer generative adversarial network (GTGAN) to learn effective graph node relations in an end-to-end fashion for challenging graph-constrained architectural layout generation tasks. The proposed graph-Transformer-based generator includes a novel graph Transformer encoder that combines graph convolutions and self-attentions in a Transformer to model both local and global interactions across connected and non-connected graph nodes. Specifically, the proposed connected node attention (CNA) and non-connected node attention (NNA) aim to capture the global relations across connected nodes and non-connected nodes in the input graph, respectively. The proposed graph modeling block (GMB) aims to exploit local vertex interactions based on a house layout topology. Moreover, we propose a new node classification-based discriminator to preserve the high-level semantic and discriminative node features for different house components. To maintain the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted graphs, we also propose a novel graph-based cycle-consistency loss. Finally, we propose a novel self-guided pre-training method for graph representation learning. This approach involves simultaneous masking of nodes and edges at an elevated mask ratio (i.e., 40%) and their subsequent reconstruction using an asymmetric graph-centric autoencoder architecture. This method markedly improves the model's learning proficiency and expediency. Experiments on three challenging graph-constrained architectural layout generation tasks (i.e., house layout generation, house roof generation, and building layout generation) with three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realism. New state-of-the-art results are established by large margins on these three tasks. "

To address this, we propose a novel approach which harnesses the power of large, pretrained 2D diffusion models. More specifically, our approach, HexaGen3D, fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image model to jointly predict 6 orthographic projections and the corresponding latent triplane. We then decode these latents to generate a textured mesh. HexaGen3D does not require per-sample optimization, and can infer high-quality and diverse objects from textual prompts in 7 seconds, offering significantly better quality-to-latency trade-offs when comparing to existing approaches. Furthermore, HexaGen3D demonstrates strong generalization to new objects or compositions. "

Deploying LLM agents in 6G networks enables users to access previously expensive AI assistant services via mobile devices democratically, thereby reducing interaction latency and better preserving user privacy. Nevertheless, the limited capacity of mobile devices constrains the effectiveness of deploying and executing local LLMs, which necessitates offloading complex tasks to global LLMs running on edge servers during long-horizon interactions. In this article, we propose a split learning system for LLM agents in 6G networks leveraging the collaboration between mobile devices and edge servers, where multiple LLMs with different roles are distributed across mobile devices and edge servers to perform user-agent interactive tasks collaboratively. In the proposed system, LLM agents are split into perception, grounding, and alignment modules, facilitating inter-module communications to meet extended user requirements on 6G network functions, including integrated sensing and communication, digital twins, and task-oriented communications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel model caching algorithm for LLMs within the proposed system to improve model utilization in context, thus reducing network costs of the collaborative mobile and edge LLM agents.

        "abstract": "Computer vision tasks typically involve describing what is present in an image (e.g. classification, detection, segmentation, and captioning). We study a visual common sense task that requires understanding what is not present. Specifically, given an image (e.g. of a living room) and name of an object (\"cushion\"), a vision system is asked to predict semantically-meaningful regions (masks or bounding boxes) in the image where that object could be placed or is likely be placed by humans (e.g. on the sofa). We call this task: Semantic Placement (SP) and believe that such common-sense visual understanding is critical for assitive robots (tidying a house), and AR devices (automatically rendering an object in the user's space). Studying the invisible is hard. Datasets for image description are typically constructed by curating relevant images and asking humans to annotate the contents of the image; neither of those two steps are straightforward for objects not present in the image. We overcome this challenge by operating in the opposite direction: we start with an image of an object in context from web, and then remove that object from the image via inpainting. This automated pipeline converts unstructured web data into a dataset comprising pairs of images with/without the object. Using this, we collect a novel dataset, with ${\\sim}1.3$M images across $9$ object categories, and train a SP prediction model called CLIP-UNet. CLIP-UNet outperforms existing VLMs and baselines that combine semantic priors with object detectors on real-world and simulated images. In our user studies, we find that the SP masks predicted by CLIP-UNet are favored $43.7\\%$ and $31.3\\%$ times when comparing against the $4$ SP baselines on real and simulated images. In addition, we demonstrate leveraging SP mask predictions from CLIP-UNet enables downstream applications like building tidying robots in indoor environments. "

        "abstract": "Generative models have demonstrated remarkable capability in synthesizing high-quality text, images, and videos. For video generation, contemporary text-to-video models exhibit impressive capabilities, crafting visually stunning videos. Nonetheless, evaluating such videos poses significant challenges. Current research predominantly employs automated metrics such as FVD, IS, and CLIP Score. However, these metrics provide an incomplete analysis, particularly in the temporal assessment of video content, thus rendering them unreliable indicators of true video quality. Furthermore, while user studies have the potential to reflect human perception accurately, they are hampered by their time-intensive and laborious nature, with outcomes that are often tainted by subjective bias. In this paper, we investigate the limitations inherent in existing metrics and introduce a novel evaluation pipeline, the Text-to-Video Score (T2VScore). This metric integrates two pivotal criteria: (1) Text-Video Alignment, which scrutinizes the fidelity of the video in representing the given text description, and (2) Video Quality, which evaluates the video's overall production caliber with a mixture of experts. Moreover, to evaluate the proposed metrics and facilitate future improvements on them, we present the TVGE dataset, collecting human judgements of 2,543 text-to-video generated videos on the two criteria. Experiments on the TVGE dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed T2VScore on offering a better metric for text-to-video generation. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are in need of sufficient contexts to handle many critical applications, such as retrieval augmented generation and few-shot learning. However, due to the constrained window size, the LLMs can only access to the information within a limited context. Although the size of context window can be extended by fine-tuning, it will result in a substantial cost in both training and inference stage. In this paper, we present Extensible Tokenization as an alternative method which realizes the flexible scaling of LLMs' context. Extensible Tokenization stands as a midware in between of the tokenized context and the LLM, which transforms the raw token embeddings into the extensible embeddings. Such embeddings provide a more compact representation for the long context, on top of which the LLM is able to perceive more information with the same context window. Extensible Tokenization is also featured by its flexibility: the scaling factor can be flexibly determined within a feasible scope, leading to the extension of an arbitrary context length at the inference time. Besides, Extensible Tokenization is introduced as a drop-in component, which can be seamlessly plugged into not only the LLM itself and but also its fine-tuned derivatives, bringing in the extended contextual information while fully preserving the LLM's existing capabilities. We perform comprehensive experiments on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks, which verify Extensible Tokenization as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend LLM's context. Our model and source code will be made publicly available. "

        "abstract": "Large language models show compelling performance on reasoning tasks but they tend to perform much worse in languages other than English. This is unsurprising given that their training data largely consists of English text and instructions. A typical solution is to translate instruction data into all languages of interest, and then train on the resulting multilingual data, which is called translate-training. This approach not only incurs high cost, but also results in poorly translated data due to the non-standard formatting of chain-of-thought and mathematical reasoning instructions. In this paper, we explore the benefits of question alignment, where we train the model to translate reasoning questions into English by finetuning on X-English question data. In this way we perform targetted, in-domain language alignment which makes best use of English instruction data to unlock the LLMs' multilingual reasoning abilities. Experimental results on LLaMA2-13B show that question alignment leads to consistent improvements over the translate-training approach: an average improvement of 11.3\\% and 16.1\\% accuracy across ten languages on the MGSM and MSVAMP maths reasoning benchmarks (The project will be available at: https://github.com/NJUNLP/QAlign).

For a language spoken by roughly 300 million people, the technology enabling them to run trials on their favored tongue is severely lacking. In this paper, we analyze the SOTA for SA in Bengali, particularly, Transformer-based models.

Thus, the susceptibility of recently proposed multilingual detectors is still unknown. We fill this gap by comprehensively benchmarking the performance of 10 well-known AO methods, attacking 37 MGT detection methods against MGTs in 11 languages (i.e., 10 $\\times$ 37 $\\times$ 11 = 4,070 combinations).

This limitation hinders them from timely correcting previous missing statements during coding as humans do, often leading to error propagation and suboptimal performance. We introduce JumpCoder, a novel modelagnostic framework that enables online modification and non-sequential generation to augment the code LLMs. The key idea behind JumpCoder is to insert new code into the currently generated code when necessary during generation, which is achieved through an auxiliary infilling model that works in tandem with the code LLM. Since identifying the best infill position beforehand is intractable, we adopt an infill-first, judge-later strategy, which experiments with filling at the $k$ most critical positions following the generation of each line, and uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser alongside the Generation Model Scoring to effectively judge the validity of each potential infill. Extensive experiments using six state-of-the-art code LLMs across multiple benchmarks consistently indicate significant improvements over all baselines. Notably, JumpCoder assists code LLMs in achieving up to a 3.6% increase in Pass@1 for Python, 6.3% for Java, and 3.7% for C++ in the multilingual HumanEval benchmarks.

As such, removing these symbols has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the processing of morphologically complex words for transformer encoders in the pretrain-finetune paradigm. In this work, we explore whether word boundary information is at all useful to such models. In particular, we train transformer encoders across four different training scales, and investigate several alternative approaches to including word boundary information, evaluating on a range of tasks across different domains and problem set-ups: GLUE (for sentence-level classification), NER (for token-level classification), and two classification datasets involving complex words (Superbizarre and FLOTA). Overall, through an extensive experimental setup that includes the pre-training of 29 models, we find no substantial improvements from our alternative approaches, suggesting that modifying tokenisers to remove word boundary information isn't leading to a loss of useful information.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07927",
        "abstract": "Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, and will even provide explanations for their behavior. Since these models are directly accessible to the public, there is a risk that convincing and wrong explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs. Therefore, interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations is an important consideration for AI Safety. Assessing the interpretability-faithfulness of these explanations, termed self-explanations, is challenging as the models are too complex for humans to annotate what is a correct explanation. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks as a measure of faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make the same prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been applied to LLM's self-explanations. We apply self-consistency checks to three types of self-explanations: counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions. Our work demonstrate that faithfulness is both task and model dependent, e.g., for sentiment classification, counterfactual explanations are more faithful for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B. Finally, our findings are robust to prompt-variations. "

        "abstract": "In recent years, finding an effective and efficient strategy for exploiting spatial and temporal information has been a hot research topic in video saliency prediction (VSP). With the emergence of spatio-temporal transformers, the weakness of the prior strategies, e.g., 3D convolutional networks and LSTM-based networks, for capturing long-range dependencies has been effectively compensated. While VSP has drawn benefits from spatio-temporal transformers, finding the most effective way for aggregating temporal features is still challenging. To address this concern, we propose a transformer-based video saliency prediction approach with high temporal dimension decoding network (THTD-Net). This strategy accounts for the lack of complex hierarchical interactions between features that are extracted from the transformer-based spatio-temporal encoder: in particular, it does not require multiple decoders and aims at gradually reducing temporal features' dimensions in the decoder. This decoder-based architecture yields comparable performance to multi-branch and over-complicated models on common benchmarks such as DHF1K, UCF-sports and Hollywood-2. "

However, such applications are currently limited by LLMs' deficiencies in understanding intricate scientific concepts, deriving symbolic equations, and solving advanced numerical calculations. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciGLM, a suite of scientific language models able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning. Central to our approach is a novel self-reflective instruction annotation framework to address the data scarcity challenge in the science domain. This framework leverages existing LLMs to generate step-by-step reasoning for unlabelled scientific questions, followed by a process of self-reflective critic-and-revise. Applying this framework, we curated SciInstruct, a diverse and high-quality dataset encompassing mathematics, physics, chemistry, and formal proofs. We fine-tuned the ChatGLM family of language models with SciInstruct, enhancing their capabilities in scientific and mathematical reasoning. Remarkably, SciGLM consistently improves both the base model (ChatGLM3-6B-Base) and larger-scale models (12B and 32B), without sacrificing the language understanding capabilities of the base model. This makes SciGLM a suitable foundational model to facilitate diverse scientific discovery tasks. For the benefit of the wider research community, we release SciInstruct, SciGLM, alongside a self-reflective framework and fine-tuning code at \\url{https://github.com/THUDM/SciGLM}. "

        "abstract": "Image similarity has been extensively studied in computer vision. In recently years, machine-learned models have shown their ability to encode more semantics than traditional multivariate metrics. However, in labelling similarity, assigning a numerical score to a pair of images is less intuitive than determining if an image A is closer to a reference image R than another image B. In this work, we present a novel approach for building an image similarity model based on labelled data in the form of A:R vs B:R. We address the challenges of sparse sampling in the image space (R, A, B) and biases in the models trained with context-based data by using an ensemble model. In particular, we employed two ML techniques to construct such an ensemble model, namely dimensionality reduction and MLP regressors. Our testing results show that the ensemble model constructed performs ~5% better than the best individual context-sensitive models. They also performed better than the model trained with mixed imagery data as well as existing similarity models, e.g., CLIP and DINO. This work demonstrate that context-based labelling and model training can be effective when an appropriate ensemble approach is used to alleviate the limitation due to sparse sampling. "

In this study, we tackle one of the most widely used tasks - answering Multiple Choice Question (MCQ). We analyze 26 small open-source models and find that 65% of the models do not understand the task, only 4 models properly select an answer from the given choices, and only 5 of these models are choice order independent. These results are rather alarming given the extensive use of MCQ tests with these models.

        "abstract": "Addition is perhaps one of the simplest arithmetic tasks one can think of and is usually performed using the carrying over algorithm. This algorithm consists of two tasks: adding digits in the same position and carrying over a one whenever necessary. We study how transformer models implement this algorithm and how the two aforementioned tasks are allocated to different parts of the network. We first focus on two-layer encoder-only models and show that the carrying over algorithm is implemented in a modular fashion. The first layer is mostly responsible for adding digits in the same position. The second layer first decides, in the attention, which positions need a carried one or not, and then performs the carrying of the one in the final MLP. We provide a simple way of precisely identifying which neurons are responsible for that task. This implementation of the carrying over algorithm occurs across a range of hyperparameters for two as well as three-layer models. For small decoder-only models, we observe the same implementation and provide suggestive evidence for its existence in three 7B large language models. "

        "abstract": "Research shows that grammatical mistakes in a sentence can be corrected by translating it to another language and back using neural machine translation with language models. We investigate whether this correction capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) extends to Automatic Program Repair (APR). Current generative models for APR are pre-trained on source code and fine-tuned for repair. This paper proposes bypassing the fine-tuning step and using Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translation of code from one programming language to another programming or natural language, and back. We hypothesize that RTT with LLMs restores the most commonly seen patterns in code during pre-training, i.e., performs a regression toward the mean, which removes bugs as they are a form of noise w.r.t. the more frequent, natural, bug-free code in the training data. To test this hypothesis, we employ eight recent LLMs pre-trained on code, including the latest GPT versions, and four common program repair benchmarks in Java. We find that RTT with English as an intermediate language repaired 101 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java dataset. Moreover, 46 of these are unique bugs that are not repaired by other LLMs fine-tuned for APR. Our findings highlight the viability of round-trip translation with LLMs as a technique for automated program repair and its potential for research in software engineering. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08017",
        "abstract": "The main challenge for small object detection algorithms is to ensure accuracy while pursuing real-time performance. The RT-DETR model performs well in real-time object detection, but performs poorly in small object detection accuracy. In order to compensate for the shortcomings of the RT-DETR model in small object detection, two key improvements are proposed in this study. Firstly, The RT-DETR utilises a Transformer that receives input solely from the final layer of Backbone features. This means that the Transformer's input only receives semantic information from the highest level of abstraction in the Deep Network, and ignores detailed information such as edges, texture or color gradients that are critical to the location of small objects at lower levels of abstraction. Including only deep features can introduce additional background noise. This can have a negative impact on the accuracy of small object detection. To address this issue, we propose the fine-grained path augmentation method. This method helps to locate small objects more accurately by providing detailed information to the deep network. So, the input to the transformer contains both semantic and detailed information. Secondly, In RT-DETR, the decoder takes feature maps of different levels as input after concatenating them with equal weight. However, this operation is not effective in dealing with the complex relationship of multi-scale information captured by feature maps of different sizes. Therefore, we propose an adaptive feature fusion algorithm that assigns learnable parameters to each feature map from different levels. This allows the model to adaptively fuse feature maps from different levels and effectively integrate feature information from different scales. This enhances the model's ability to capture object features at different scales, thereby improving the accuracy of detecting small objects. "

While these models offer numerous advantages in terms of revolutionizing work and study methods, they have also garnered significant attention due to their potential negative consequences. One example is generating academic reports or papers with little to no human contribution. Consequently, researchers have focused on developing detectors to address the misuse of LLMs. However, most existing methods prioritize achieving higher accuracy on restricted datasets, neglecting the crucial aspect of generalizability. This limitation hinders their practical application in real-life scenarios where reliability is paramount. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of prompts on the text generated by LLMs and highlight the potential lack of robustness in one of the current state-of-the-art GPT detectors. To mitigate these issues concerning the misuse of LLMs in academic writing, we propose a reference-based Siamese detector named Synthetic-Siamese which takes a pair of texts, one as the inquiry and the other as the reference. Our method effectively addresses the lack of robustness of previous detectors (OpenAI detector and DetectGPT) and significantly improves the baseline performances in realistic academic writing scenarios by approximately 67% to 95%.

Recently, deep neural networks such as Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have been introduced for vein recognition and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Despite the recent advances, however, existing solutions for finger-vein feature extraction are still not optimal due to scarce training image samples. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial masking contrastive learning (AMCL) approach, that generates challenging samples to train a more robust contrastive learning model for the downstream palm-vein recognition task, by alternatively optimizing the encoder in the contrastive learning model and a set of latent variables. First, a huge number of masks are generated to train a robust generative adversarial network (GAN). The trained generator transforms a latent variable from the latent variable space into a mask space. Then, we combine the trained generator with a contrastive learning model to obtain our AMCL, where the generator produces challenging masking images to increase the contrastive loss and the contrastive learning model is trained based on the harder images to learn a more robust feature representation. After training, the trained encoder in the contrastive learning model is combined with a classification layer to build a classifier, which is further fine-tuned on labeled training data for vein recognition. The experimental results on three databases demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing contrastive learning approaches in terms of improving identification accuracy of vein classifiers and achieves state-of-the-art recognition results.

        "abstract": "Existing large language models (LLMs) for machine translation are typically fine-tuned on sentence-level translation instructions and achieve satisfactory performance at the sentence level. However, when applied to document-level translation, these models face a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with documents containing over 512 tokens. This challenge arises from the issue of sentence-level coverage, where subsequent sentences in the document remain untranslated. As a result, the document-level translation capability of LLMs fine-tuned on sentence-level translation instructions is significantly limited. We conjecture that the primary cause of LLMs' weak document-level translation performance is the absence of document-to-document mapping ability. To address the issue, we propose an approach that combines sentence-level and document-level translation instructions of varying lengths to fine-tune LLMs. Our proposed translation mixed-instructions enable LLMs (Llama-2~7B and 13B) to maintain consistent translation performance from the sentence level to documents containing as many as 2048 tokens. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the document-level translation capabilities of LLMs on 10 language pairs, effectively mitigating the sentence-level coverage issue in document-level translation. Experimentation on discourse phenomena has demonstrated that our document-level translation approach significantly improves translation quality, both in terms of BLEU score and discourse coherence. "

        "abstract": "This study introduces a novel method for inpainting normal maps using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Normal maps, often derived from a lightstage, are crucial in performance capture but can have obscured areas due to movement (e.g., by arms, hair, or props). Inpainting fills these missing areas with plausible data. Our approach extends previous general image inpainting techniques, employing a bow tie-like generator network and a discriminator network, with alternating training phases. The generator aims to synthesize images aligning with the ground truth and deceive the discriminator, which differentiates between real and processed images. Periodically, the discriminator undergoes retraining to enhance its ability to identify processed images. Importantly, our method adapts to the unique characteristics of normal map data, necessitating modifications to the loss function. We utilize a cosine loss instead of mean squared error loss for generator training. Limited training data availability, even with synthetic datasets, demands significant augmentation, considering the specific nature of the input data. This includes appropriate image flipping and in-plane rotations to accurately alter normal vectors. Throughout training, we monitored key metrics such as average loss, Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for the generator, along with average loss and accuracy for the discriminator. Our findings suggest that the proposed model effectively generates high-quality, realistic inpainted normal maps, suitable for performance capture applications. These results establish a foundation for future research, potentially involving more advanced networks and comparisons with inpainting of source images used to create the normal maps. "

        "abstract": "Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of identifying latent risks of unexpected volatility in future observations. To address this gap, probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have emerged as uncertainty-aware solutions. However, existing diffusion methods typically focus on generating separate future time series for individual sensors in the traffic network, resulting in insufficient involvement of spatial network characteristics in the probabilistic learning process. To better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework. Our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Numerical experiments show that SpecSTG achieves outstanding performance with traffic flow and traffic speed datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

        "abstract": "Global pandemics can wreak havoc and lead to significant social, economic, and personal losses. Preventing the spread of infectious diseases requires implementing interventions at different levels of government, and evaluating the potential impact and efficacy of those preemptive measures. Agent-based modeling can be used for detailed studies of epidemic diffusion and possible interventions. We present Loimos, a highly parallel simulation of epidemic diffusion written on top of Charm++, an asynchronous task-based parallel runtime. Loimos uses a hybrid of time-stepping and discrete-event simulation to model disease spread. We demonstrate that our implementation of Loimos is able to scale to large core counts on an HPC system. In particular, Loimos is able to simulate a US-scale synthetic interaction network in an average of 1.497 seconds per simulation day when executed on 16 nodes on Rivanna at the University of Virginia, processing around 428 billion interactions (person-person edges) in under five minutes for an average of 1.4 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS).

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08138",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) enable state-of-the-art semantic capabilities to be added to software systems such as semantic search of unstructured documents and text generation. However, these models are computationally expensive. At scale, the cost of serving thousands of users increases massively affecting also user experience. To address this problem, semantic caches are used to check for answers to similar queries (that may have been phrased differently) without hitting the LLM service. Due to the nature of these semantic cache techniques that rely on query embeddings, there is a high chance of errors impacting user confidence in the system. Adopting semantic cache techniques usually requires testing the effectiveness of a semantic cache (accurate cache hits and misses) which requires a labelled test set of similar queries and responses which is often unavailable. In this paper, we present VaryGen, an approach for using LLMs for test input generation that produces similar questions from unstructured text documents. Our novel approach uses the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to 1) adapt queries to the domain, 2) synthesise subtle variations to queries, and 3) evaluate the synthesised test dataset. We evaluated our approach in the domain of a student question and answer system by qualitatively analysing 100 generated queries and result pairs, and conducting an empirical case study with an open source semantic cache. Our results show that query pairs satisfy human expectations of similarity and our generated data demonstrates failure cases of a semantic cache. Additionally, we also evaluate our approach on Qasper dataset. This work is an important first step into test input generation for semantic applications and presents considerations for practitioners when calibrating a semantic cache. "

        "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have gained popularity across various applications. However, they face challenges in the sparse view setting, lacking sufficient constraints from volume rendering. Reconstructing and understanding a 3D scene from sparse and unconstrained cameras is a long-standing problem in classical computer vision with diverse applications. While recent works have explored NeRFs in sparse, unconstrained view scenarios, their focus has been primarily on enhancing reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our approach takes a broader perspective by posing the question: \"from where has each point been seen?\" -- which gates how well we can understand and reconstruct it. In other words, we aim to determine the origin or provenance of each 3D point and its associated information under sparse, unconstrained views. We introduce ProvNeRF, a model that enriches a traditional NeRF representation by incorporating per-point provenance, modeling likely source locations for each point. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) for stochastic processes. Notably, our method is compatible with any pre-trained NeRF model and the associated training camera poses. We demonstrate that modeling per-point provenance offers several advantages, including uncertainty estimation, criteria-based view selection, and improved novel view synthesis, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

        "abstract": "To realize holographic communications, a potential technology for spectrum efficiency improvement in the future sixth-generation (6G) network, antenna arrays inlaid with numerous antenna elements will be deployed. However, the increase in antenna aperture size makes some users lie in the Fresnel region, leading to the hybrid near-field and far-field communication mode, where the conventional far-field channel estimation methods no longer work well. To tackle the above challenge, this paper considers channel estimation in a hybrid-field multipath environment, where each user and each scatterer can be in either the far-field or the near-field region. First, a joint angular-polar domain channel transform is designed to capture the hybrid-field channel's near-field and far-field features. We then analyze the power diffusion effect in the hybrid-field channel, which indicates that the power corresponding to one near-field (far-field) path component of the multipath channel may spread to far-field (near-field) paths and causes estimation error. We design a novel power-diffusion-based orthogonal matching pursuit channel estimation algorithm (PD-OMP). It can eliminate the prior knowledge requirement of path numbers in the far field and near field, which is a must in other OMP-based channel estimation algorithms. Simulation results show that PD-OMP outperforms current hybrid-field channel estimation methods. "

        "abstract": "Large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), such as large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the artificial intelligence (AI) field and become increasingly popular. However, training or fine-tuning such models requires substantial computational power and resources, where the memory capacity of a single acceleration device like a GPU is one of the most important bottlenecks. Owing to the prohibitively large overhead (e.g., $10 \\times$) of GPUs' native memory allocator, DNN frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow adopt a caching allocator that maintains a memory pool with a splitting mechanism for fast memory (de)allocation. Unfortunately, the caching allocator's efficiency degrades quickly for popular memory reduction techniques such as recomputation, offloading, distributed training, and low-rank adaptation. The primary reason is that those memory reduction techniques introduce frequent and irregular memory (de)allocation requests, leading to severe fragmentation problems for the splitting-based caching allocator. To mitigate this fragmentation problem, we propose a novel memory allocation framework based on low-level GPU virtual memory management called GPU memory lake (GMLake). GMLake employs a novel virtual memory stitching (VMS) mechanism, which can fuse or combine non-contiguous memory blocks with a virtual memory address mapping. GMLake can reduce an average of 9.2 GB (up to 25 GB) GPU memory usage and 15% (up to 33% ) fragmentation among eight LLM models on GPU A100 with 80 GB memory. GMLake is completely transparent to the DNN models and memory reduction techniques and ensures the seamless execution of resource-intensive deep-learning tasks. We have open-sourced GMLake at https://github.com/intelligent-machine-learning/glake/tree/main/GMLake. "

This dataset is derived from GSM8K and MATH and has been further refined through a combination of GPT-4 annotations, human review, and self-training processes, where the errors in the original GSM8K training set have been fixed. Additionally, we propose a tentative, easily replicable protocol for the fine-tuning of math-specific LLMs, which has led to a significant improvement in the performance of a 7B-parameter LLM on the GSM8K and MATH datasets. We are committed to advancing the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs and, to that end, we have made the model checkpoints and will make the dataset publicly available.

However, existing methods face challenges in terms of their effectiveness and training efficiency, especially when it comes to training and integrating multiple retrievers to handle multi-modal queries. In this paper, we propose an innovative end-to-end generative framework for multi-modal knowledge retrieval. Our framework takes advantage of the fact that large language models (LLMs) can effectively serve as virtual knowledge bases, even when trained with limited data. We retrieve knowledge via a two-step process: 1) generating knowledge clues related to the queries, and 2) obtaining the relevant document by searching databases using the knowledge clue. In particular, we first introduce an object-aware prefix-tuning technique to guide multi-grained visual learning. Then, we align multi-grained visual features into the textual feature space of the LLM, employing the LLM to capture cross-modal interactions. Subsequently, we construct instruction data with a unified format for model training. Finally, we propose the knowledge-guided generation strategy to impose prior constraints in the decoding steps, thereby promoting the generation of distinctive knowledge clues. Through experiments conducted on three benchmarks, we demonstrate significant improvements ranging from 3.0% to 14.6% across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines. "

The introduced token dictionary could learn prior information from training data and adapt the learned prior to specific testing image through an adaptive refinement step. The refinement strategy could not only provide global information to all input tokens but also group image tokens into categories. Based on category partitions, we further propose a category-based self-attention mechanism designed to leverage distant but similar tokens for enhancing input features.

Null-shot prompting exploits hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by instructing LLMs to utilize information from the \"Examples\" section that never exists within the provided context to perform a task.

Experiments with six LLMs show improvements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including reading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question answering. The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent hallucination in each model. These differences show that it is possible to utilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs using existing benchmarking datasets. We also perform ablation studies, including experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that incorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows different trends of results.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the efficacy of these systems, showcasing their robust generalization abilities across diverse language-related tasks. Accompanying these developments are various agents based on LLMs, which facilitate their application in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based agent framework for resume screening, aimed at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes.

To bridge this gap, we introduce RoTBench, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model's resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no substantial change in manual accuracy. More surprisingly, the noise correction capability inherent in the GPT family paradoxically impedes its adaptability in the face of mild noise. In light of these findings, we propose RoTTuning, a strategy that enriches the diversity of training environments to bolster the robustness of LLMs in tool learning.

This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search. Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase. Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words. However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist. While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08352",
        "abstract": "Porous media processes involve various physical phenomena such as mechanical deformation, transport, and fluid flow. Accurate simulations must capture the strong couplings between these phenomena. Choosing an efficient solver for the multiphysics problem usually entails the decoupling into subproblems related to separate physical phenomena. Then, the suitable solvers for each subproblem and the iteration scheme must be chosen. The wide range of options for the solver components makes finding the optimum difficult and time-consuming; moreover, solvers come with numerical parameters that need to be optimized. As a further complication, the solver performance may depend on the physical regime of the simulation model, which may vary with time. Switching a solver with respect to the dominant process can be beneficial, but the threshold of when to switch solver is unclear and complicated to analyze. We address this challenge by developing a machine learning framework that automatically searches for the optimal solver for a given multiphysics simulation setup, based on statistical data from previously solved problems. For a series of problems, exemplified by successive time steps in a time-dependent simulation, the framework updates and improves its decision model online during the simulation. We show how it outperforms preselected state-of-the-art solvers for test problem setups. The examples are based on simulations of poromechanics and simulations of flow and transport. For the quasi-static linear Biot model, we demonstrate automated tuning of numerical solver parameters by showing how the L-parameter of the so-called Fixed-Stress preconditioner can be optimized. Motivated by a test example where the main heat transfer mechanism changes between convection and diffusion, we discuss how the solver selector can dynamically switch solvers when the dominant physical phenomenon changes with time.

Our approach can use a single human demonstration to abstract information about the demonstrated task, and use that information to generalise and replicate it. We facilitate this ability by a new integration of two state-of-the-art methods: a diffusion action segmentation model to abstract temporal information from the demonstration and an open vocabulary object detector for spatial information. Furthermore, we refine the abstracted information and use symbolic reasoning to create an action plan utilising inverse kinematics, to allow the robot to imitate the demonstrated action. "

        "abstract": "In large language models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the Mixture of Experts paradigm has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing model expressiveness and accuracy. However, deploying GPT MoE models for parallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert routing and aggregation. This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already complex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight optimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models. We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication overhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity. Unlike previous methods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without any fine-tuning or accuracy degradation. By proposing a context-coherent expert parallelism on distributed systems, our design only uses one Alltoall communication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all require two Alltoalls. By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design an efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% cross-GPU routing latency. Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE implementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in inference throughput. We further provide a detailed study of how the model implicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and how this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training. "

        "abstract": "The field of AI agents is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving tasks for the image modality, which limits their ability to understand the dynamic nature of the real world, making it still far from real-life applications, e.g., guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes. Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing and perceptually intensive nature of real-world scenarios, we devise DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to handle dynamic video tasks. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video with massive content into a symbolic memory that stores \\textit{task-related} attributes. This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by sub-task tools, resulting in concise and relevant intermediate results. Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover, we introduce a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT in dynamic scenes and provide in-the-wild showcases demonstrating its ability to handle more complex questions than previous studies. "

        "abstract": "There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning. RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.

        "abstract": "Transformers have become central to recent advances in audio classification. However, training an audio spectrogram transformer, e.g. AST, from scratch can be resource and time-intensive. Furthermore, the complexity of transformers heavily depends on the input audio spectrogram size. In this work, we aim to optimize AST training by linking to the resolution in the time-axis. We introduce multi-phase training of audio spectrogram transformers by connecting the seminal idea of coarse-to-fine with transformer models. To achieve this, we propose a set of methods for temporal compression. By employing one of these methods, the transformer model learns from lower-resolution (coarse) data in the initial phases, and then is fine-tuned with high-resolution data later in a curriculum learning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed training mechanism for AST leads to improved (or on-par) performance with faster convergence, i.e. requiring fewer computational resources and less time. This approach is also generalizable to other AST-based methods regardless of their learning paradigms. "

In this study, we bridge this performance gap. We first assess the shortcomings of supervised fine-tuning for LLMs in the MT task, emphasizing the quality issues present in the reference data, despite being human-generated. Then, in contrast to SFT which mimics reference translations, we introduce Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), a novel approach that trains models to avoid generating adequate but not perfect translations. Applying CPO to ALMA models with only 22K parallel sentences and 12M parameters yields significant improvements. The resulting model, called ALMA-R, can match or exceed the performance of the WMT competition winners and GPT-4 on WMT'21, WMT'22 and WMT'23 test datasets. "

Current deep learning-based models for AVS are trained to optimize holistic similarity between short videos and their associated descriptions. However, due to the diversity of ad-hoc queries, even for a short video, its truly relevant part w.r.t. a given query can be of shorter duration. In such a scenario, the holistic similarity becomes suboptimal. To remedy the issue, we propose in this paper CLIPRerank, a fine-grained re-scoring method. We compute cross-modal similarities between query and video frames using a pre-trained CLIP model, with multi-frame scores aggregated by max pooling. The fine-grained score is weightedly added to the initial score for search result reranking. As such, CLIPRerank is agnostic to the underlying video retrieval models and extremely simple, making it a handy plug-in for boosting AVS. Experiments on the challenging TRECVID AVS benchmarks (from 2016 to 2021) justify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. CLIPRerank consistently improves the TRECVID top performers and multiple existing models including SEA, W2VV++, Dual Encoding, Dual Task, LAFF, CLIP2Video, TS2-Net and X-CLIP.

However, CORL faces challenges in balancing stability and plasticity. Existing methods, employing Actor-Critic structures and experience replay (ER), suffer from distribution shifts, low efficiency, and weak knowledge-sharing. We aim to investigate whether Decision Transformer (DT), another offline RL paradigm, can serve as a more suitable offline continuous learner to address these issues. We first compare AC-based offline algorithms with DT in the CORL framework. DT offers advantages in learning efficiency, distribution shift mitigation, and zero-shot generalization but exacerbates the forgetting problem during supervised parameter updates. We introduce multi-head DT (MH-DT) and low-rank adaptation DT (LoRA-DT) to mitigate DT's forgetting problem. MH-DT stores task-specific knowledge using multiple heads, facilitating knowledge sharing with common components. It employs distillation and selective rehearsal to enhance current task learning when a replay buffer is available. In buffer-unavailable scenarios, LoRA-DT merges less influential weights and fine-tunes DT's decisive MLP layer to adapt to the current task. Extensive experiments on MoJuCo and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform SOTA CORL baselines and showcase enhanced learning capabilities and superior memory efficiency. "

We consistently find that LLMs portray African, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as more homogeneous than White Americans. They also portray women as more homogeneous than men, but these differences are small. Finally, we find that the effect of gender differs across racial/ethnic groups such that the effect of gender is consistent within African and Hispanic Americans but not within Asian and White Americans.

We illustrate the practical implication of these findings by pre-training a 7 billion parameter AIM on 2 billion images, that achieves 84.0% on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Interestingly, even at this scale, we observe no sign of saturation in performance, suggesting that AIM potentially represents a new frontier for training large-scale vision models.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising progress on synthesizing 3D human motion from text, with methods that can generate character animations from short prompts and specified durations. However, using a single text prompt as input lacks the fine-grained control needed by animators, such as composing multiple actions and defining precise durations for parts of the motion. To address this, we introduce the new problem of timeline control for text-driven motion synthesis, which provides an intuitive, yet fine-grained, input interface for users. Instead of a single prompt, users can specify a multi-track timeline of multiple prompts organized in temporal intervals that may overlap. This enables specifying the exact timings of each action and composing multiple actions in sequence or at overlapping intervals. To generate composite animations from a multi-track timeline, we propose a new test-time denoising method. This method can be integrated with any pre-trained motion diffusion model to synthesize realistic motions that accurately reflect the timeline. At every step of denoising, our method processes each timeline interval (text prompt) individually, subsequently aggregating the predictions with consideration for the specific body parts engaged in each action. Experimental comparisons and ablations validate that our method produces realistic motions that respect the semantics and timing of given text prompts.

        "abstract": "We propose RoHM, an approach for robust 3D human motion reconstruction from monocular RGB(-D) videos in the presence of noise and occlusions. Most previous approaches either train neural networks to directly regress motion in 3D or learn data-driven motion priors and combine them with optimization at test time. The former do not recover globally coherent motion and fail under occlusions; the latter are time-consuming, prone to local minima, and require manual tuning. To overcome these shortcomings, we exploit the iterative, denoising nature of diffusion models. RoHM is a novel diffusion-based motion model that, conditioned on noisy and occluded input data, reconstructs complete, plausible motions in consistent global coordinates. Given the complexity of the problem -- requiring one to address different tasks (denoising and infilling) in different solution spaces (local and global motion) -- we decompose it into two sub-tasks and learn two models, one for global trajectory and one for local motion. To capture the correlations between the two, we then introduce a novel conditioning module, combining it with an iterative inference scheme. We apply RoHM to a variety of tasks -- from motion reconstruction and denoising to spatial and temporal infilling. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches qualitatively and quantitatively, while being faster at test time. The code will be available at https://sanweiliti.github.io/ROHM/ROHM.html. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08577",
        "abstract": "Human beings possess the capability to multiply a melange of multisensory cues while actively exploring and interacting with the 3D world. Current multi-modal large language models, however, passively absorb sensory data as inputs, lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information. To usher in the study of this area, we propose MultiPLY, a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data, including visual, audio, tactile, and thermal information into large language models, thereby establishing the correlation among words, actions, and percepts. To this end, we first collect Multisensory Universe, a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data, we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment, as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time, MultiPLY could generate action tokens, instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens. We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval, tool use, multisensory captioning, and task decomposition. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06740",
        "abstract": "We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European basket options written on assets that follow jump-diffusion dynamics. The option pricing problem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which is approximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-stepping approach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized via two different approaches: a) a sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite approximation following localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions, and b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule. Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the asymptotic behavior of the solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistent outputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution. The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of the methods are assessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Merton jump-diffusion model. "

        "abstract": "We investigate the construction of generative models capable of encoding physical constraints that can be hard to express explicitly. For the problem of inverse material design, where one seeks to design a material with a prescribed set of properties, a significant challenge is ensuring synthetic viability of a proposed new material. We encode an implicit dataset relationships, namely that certain materials can be decomposed into other ones in the dataset, and present a VAE model capable of preserving this property in the latent space and generating new samples with the same. This is particularly useful in sequential inverse material design, an emergent research area that seeks to design a material with specific properties by sequentially adding (or removing) elements using policies trained through deep reinforcement learning.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06794",
        "abstract": "Human behaviors, including scientific activities, are shaped by the hierarchical divisions of geography. As a result, researchers' mobility patterns vary across regions, influencing several aspects of the scientific community. These aspects encompass career trajectories, knowledge transfer, international collaborations, talent circulation, innovation diffusion, resource distribution, and policy development. However, our understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical regional scale and scientific movements is limited. This study aims to understand the subtle role of the geographical scales on scientists' mobility patterns across cities, countries, and continents. To this end, we analyzed 2.03 million scientists from 1960 to 2021, spanning institutions, cities, countries, and continents. We built a model based on hierarchical regions with different administrative levels and assessed the tendency for mobility from one region to another and the attractiveness of each region. Our findings reveal distinct nested hierarchies of regional scales and the dynamic of scientists' relocation patterns. This study sheds light on the complex dynamics of scientists' mobility and offers insights into how geographical scale and administrative divisions influence career decisions. "

        "abstract": "Summary: NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, is a program of studies led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States (U.S.). NHANES data is frequently used by biostatisticians and clinical scientists to study health trends across the U.S., but every analysis requires extensive data management and cleaning before use and this repetitive data engineering collectively costs valuable research time and decreases the reproducibility of analyses. Here, we introduce NHANES-GCP, a Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and Data Build Tool (dbt) resources built on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that automates the data engineering and management aspects of working with NHANES data. With current GCP pricing, NHANES-GCP costs less than $2 to run and less than $15/yr of ongoing costs for hosting the NHANES data, all while providing researchers with clean data tables that can readily be integrated for large-scale analyses. We provide examples of leveraging BigQuery ML to carry out the process of selecting data, integrating data, training machine learning and statistical models, and generating results all from a single SQL-like query. NHANES-GCP is designed to enhance the reproducibility of analyses and create a well-engineered NHANES data resource for statistics, machine learning, and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). "

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the Quantum Generative Diffusion Model (QGDM), a fully quantum-mechanical model for generating quantum state ensembles, inspired by Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. QGDM features a diffusion process that introduces timestep-dependent noise into quantum states, paired with a denoising mechanism trained to reverse this contamination. This model efficiently evolves a completely mixed state into a target quantum state post-training. Our comparative analysis with Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks demonstrates QGDM's superiority, with fidelity metrics exceeding 0.99 in numerical simulations involving up to 4 qubits. Additionally, we present a Resource-Efficient version of QGDM (RE-QGDM), which minimizes the need for auxiliary qubits while maintaining impressive generative capabilities for tasks involving up to 8 qubits. These results showcase the proposed models' potential for tackling challenging quantum generation problems. "

Concurrently, quantum computing is showing promising advances, especially with quantum machine learning which capitalizes on quantum mechanics to meet the increasing computational requirements of traditional machine learning algorithms. This paper explores the integration of quantum machine learning and variational quantum circuits to augment the efficacy of diffusion-based image generation models. Specifically, we address two challenges of classical diffusion models: their low sampling speed and the extensive parameter requirements. We introduce two quantum diffusion models and benchmark their capabilities against their classical counterparts using MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our models surpass the classical models with similar parameter counts in terms of performance metrics FID, SSIM, and PSNR. Moreover, we introduce a consistency model unitary single sampling architecture that combines the diffusion procedure into a single step, enabling a fast one-step image generation. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07187",
        "abstract": "In this article, we review the literature on statistical theories of neural networks from three perspectives. In the first part, results on excess risks for neural networks are reviewed in the nonparametric framework of regression or classification. These results rely on explicit constructions of neural networks, leading to fast convergence rates of excess risks, in that tools from the approximation theory are adopted. Through these constructions, the width and depth of the networks can be expressed in terms of sample size, data dimension, and function smoothness. Nonetheless, their underlying analysis only applies to the global minimizer in the highly non-convex landscape of deep neural networks. This motivates us to review the training dynamics of neural networks in the second part. Specifically, we review papers that attempt to answer ``how the neural network trained via gradient-based methods finds the solution that can generalize well on unseen data.'' In particular, two well-known paradigms are reviewed: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and Mean-Field (MF) paradigm. In the last part, we review the most recent theoretical advancements in generative models including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and in-context learning (ICL) in the Large Language Models (LLMs). The former two models are known to be the main pillars of the modern generative AI era, while ICL is a strong capability of LLMs in learning from a few examples in the context. Finally, we conclude the paper by suggesting several promising directions for deep learning theory. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07646",
        "abstract": "Anomalous diffusion processes pose a unique challenge in classification and characterization. Previously (Mangalam et al., 2023, Physical Review Research 5, 023144), we established a framework for understanding anomalous diffusion using multifractal formalism. The present study delves into the potential of multifractal spectral features for effectively distinguishing anomalous diffusion trajectories from five widely used models: fractional Brownian motion, scaled Brownian motion, continuous time random walk, annealed transient time motion, and L\\'evy walk. To accomplish this, we generate extensive datasets comprising $10^6$ trajectories from these five anomalous diffusion models and extract multiple multifractal spectra from each trajectory. Our investigation entails a thorough analysis of neural network performance, encompassing features derived from varying numbers of spectra. Furthermore, we explore the integration of multifractal spectra into traditional feature datasets, enabling us to assess their impact comprehensively. To ensure a statistically meaningful comparison, we categorize features into concept groups and train neural networks using features from each designated group. Notably, several feature groups demonstrate similar levels of accuracy, with the highest performance observed in groups utilizing moving-window characteristics and $p$-variation features. Multifractal spectral features, particularly those derived from three spectra involving different timescales and cutoffs, closely follow, highlighting their robust discriminatory potential. Remarkably, a neural network exclusively trained on features from a single multifractal spectrum exhibits commendable performance, surpassing other feature groups. Our findings underscore the diverse and potent efficacy of multifractal spectral features in enhancing classification of anomalous diffusion. "

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders (MAEs) has recently attracted great attention for remote sensing (RS) image representation learning, and thus embodies a significant potential for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) from ever-growing RS image archives. However, the existing studies on MAEs in RS assume that the considered RS images are acquired by a single image sensor, and thus are only suitable for uni-modal CBIR problems. The effectiveness of MAEs for cross-sensor CBIR, which aims to search semantically similar images across different image modalities, has not been explored yet. In this paper, we take the first step to explore the effectiveness of MAEs for sensor-agnostic CBIR in RS. To this end, we present a systematic overview on the possible adaptations of the vanilla MAE to exploit masked image modeling on multi-sensor RS image archives (denoted as cross-sensor masked autoencoders [CSMAEs]). Based on different adjustments applied to the vanilla MAE, we introduce different CSMAE models. We also provide an extensive experimental analysis of these CSMAE models. We finally derive a guideline to exploit masked image modeling for uni-modal and cross-modal CBIR problems in RS. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/jakhac/CSMAE. "

        "abstract": "Lambert's problem concerns with transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control subject to a gravitational force field. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is in fact a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schr\\\"odinger factors, as we do in this work. We explain how the resulting analysis leads to solving a boundary-coupled system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the nonlinear gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate. We propose novel algorithms for the same, and present illustrative numerical results. Our analysis and the algorithmic framework are nonparametric, i.e., we make neither statistical (e.g., Gaussian, first few moments, mixture or exponential family, finite dimensionality of the sufficient statistic) nor dynamical (e.g., Taylor series) approximations.

Additionally, we employ cross-domain SED to accurately predict soft labels, addressing the challenge of a scarcity of fine-grained emotion-annotated datasets for supervising emotional TTS training. "
