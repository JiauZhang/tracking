        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10934",
        "abstract": "In online advertising scenario, sellers often create multiple creatives to provide comprehensive demonstrations, making it essential to present the most appealing design to maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR). However, sellers generally struggle to consider users preferences for creative design, leading to the relatively lower aesthetics and quantities compared to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches. Traditional AI-based approaches still face the same problem of not considering user information while having limited aesthetic knowledge from designers. In fact that fusing the user information, the generated creatives can be more attractive because different users may have different preferences. To optimize the results, the generated creatives in traditional methods are then ranked by another module named creative ranking model. The ranking model can predict the CTR score for each creative considering user features. However, the two above stages are regarded as two different tasks and are optimized separately. In this paper, we proposed a new automated Creative Generation pipeline for Click-Through Rate (CG4CTR) with the goal of improving CTR during the creative generation stage. Our contributions have 4 parts: 1) The inpainting mode in stable diffusion is firstly applied to creative generation task in online advertising scene. A self-cyclic generation pipeline is proposed to ensure the convergence of training. 2) Prompt model is designed to generate individualized creatives for different user groups, which can further improve the diversity and quality. 3) Reward model comprehensively considers the multimodal features of image and text to improve the effectiveness of creative ranking task, and it is also critical in self-cyclic pipeline. 4) The significant benefits obtained in online and offline experiments verify the significance of our proposed method.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11002",
        "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) bares promise of social interactions that can feel more immersive than other media. Key to this is the ability to accurately animate a photorealistic avatar of one's likeness while wearing a VR headset. Although high quality registration of person-specific avatars to headset-mounted camera (HMC) images is possible in an offline setting, the performance of generic realtime models are significantly degraded. Online registration is also challenging due to oblique camera views and differences in modality. In this work, we first show that the domain gap between the avatar and headset-camera images is one of the primary sources of difficulty, where a transformer-based architecture achieves high accuracy on domain-consistent data, but degrades when the domain-gap is re-introduced. Building on this finding, we develop a system design that decouples the problem into two parts: 1) an iterative refinement module that takes in-domain inputs, and 2) a generic avatar-guided image-to-image style transfer module that is conditioned on current estimation of expression and head pose. These two modules reinforce each other, as image style transfer becomes easier when close-to-ground-truth examples are shown, and better domain-gap removal helps registration. Our system produces high-quality results efficiently, obviating the need for costly offline registration to generate personalized labels. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach through extensive experiments on a commodity headset, demonstrating significant improvements over direct regression methods as well as offline registration.

        "abstract": "Human cognitive performance is enhanced by the use of tools. For example, a human can produce a much greater, and more accurate, volume of mathematical calculation in a unit of time using a calculator or a spreadsheet application on a computer. Such tools have taken over the burden of lower level cognitive grunt work but the human still serves the role of the expert performing higher level thinking and reasoning. Recently, however, unsupervised, deep, machine learning has produced cognitive systems able to outperform humans in several domains. When humans use these tools in a human cog ensemble, the cognitive ability of the human is augmented. In some cases, even non experts can achieve, and even exceed, the performance of experts in a particular domain, synthetic expertise. A new cognitive system, ChatGPT, has burst onto the scene during the past year. This paper investigates human cognitive augmentation due to using ChatGPT by presenting the results of two experiments comparing responses created using ChatGPT with results created not using ChatGPT. We find using ChatGPT does not always result in cognitive augmentation and does not yet replace human judgement, discernment, and evaluation in certain types of tasks. In fact, ChatGPT was observed to result in misleading users resulting in negative cognitive augmentation. "

We introduce a novel methodology for the comparative analysis of intricate material expressions, emphasising the standardisation of chemical formulas to tackle the complexities inherent in materials science information assessment. To this end, we primarily focus on two critical tasks of information extraction: (i) a named entity recognition (NER) of studied materials and physical properties and (ii) a relation extraction (RE) between these entities. The performance of LLMs in executing these tasks is benchmarked against traditional models based on the BERT architecture and rule-based approaches. For NER, LLMs fail to outperform the baseline with zero-shot prompting and exhibit only limited improvement with few-shot prompting. However, for RE, a GPT-3.5-Turbo fine-tuned with the appropriate strategy outperforms all models, including the baseline. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo display remarkable reasoning and relationship extraction capabilities after being provided with merely a couple of examples, surpassing the baseline. Overall, the results suggest that although LLMs demonstrate relevant reasoning skills in connecting concepts, for tasks requiring extracting complex domain-specific entities like materials, specialised models are currently a better choice.

We exploit a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize reference pictures via textual descriptions and use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference pictures based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference picture and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across significantly varying images. Using these features, we compute pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. "

Yet, the advancement of 3D generative models is hindered by their substantial resource demands for training, along with inefficient, non-compact, and less expressive representations. This paper introduces Make-A-Shape, a new 3D generative model designed for efficient training on a vast scale, capable of utilizing 10 millions publicly-available shapes. Technical-wise, we first innovate a wavelet-tree representation to compactly encode shapes by formulating the subband coefficient filtering scheme to efficiently exploit coefficient relations. We then make the representation generatable by a diffusion model by devising the subband coefficients packing scheme to layout the representation in a low-resolution grid. Further, we derive the subband adaptive training strategy to train our model to effectively learn to generate coarse and detail wavelet coefficients. Last, we extend our framework to be controlled by additional input conditions to enable it to generate shapes from assorted modalities, e.g., single/multi-view images, point clouds, and low-resolution voxels. In our extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate various applications, such as unconditional generation, shape completion, and conditional generation on a wide range of modalities. Our approach not only surpasses the state of the art in delivering high-quality results but also efficiently generates shapes within a few seconds, often achieving this in just 2 seconds for most conditions.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D avatar generation have gained significant attentions. These breakthroughs aim to produce more realistic animatable avatars, narrowing the gap between virtual and real-world experiences. Most of existing works employ Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, combined with a differentiable renderer and text condition, to guide a diffusion model in generating 3D avatars. However, SDS often generates oversmoothed results with few facial details, thereby lacking the diversity compared with ancestral sampling. On the other hand, other works generate 3D avatar from a single image, where the challenges of unwanted lighting effects, perspective views, and inferior image quality make them difficult to reliably reconstruct the 3D face meshes with the aligned complete textures. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D avatar generation approach termed UltrAvatar with enhanced fidelity of geometry, and superior quality of physically based rendering (PBR) textures without unwanted lighting. To this end, the proposed approach presents a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model. The former removes the unwanted lighting effects to reveal true diffuse colors so that the generated avatars can be rendered under various lighting conditions. The latter follows two gradient-based guidances for generating PBR textures to render diverse face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the experiments. "

Additionally, LLM4Fuzz can leverage LLMs to guide fuzzers based on user-defined invariants, reducing blind exploration overhead. Evaluations of LLM4Fuzz on real-world DeFi projects show substantial gains in efficiency, coverage, and vulnerability detection compared to baseline fuzzing.

The absence of comprehensive healthcare systems exacerbates the severity of dengue infections, potentially leading to life-threatening circumstances. Rapid response to dengue outbreaks is also challenging due to limited information exchange and integration. While timely dengue outbreak forecasts have the potential to prevent such outbreaks, the majority of dengue prediction studies have predominantly relied on data that impose significant burdens on individual countries for collection. In this study, our aim is to improve health equity in resource-constrained countries by exploring the effectiveness of high-resolution satellite imagery as a nontraditional and readily accessible data source. By leveraging the wealth of publicly available and easily obtainable satellite imagery, we present a scalable satellite extraction framework based on Sentinel Hub, a cloud-based computing platform. Furthermore, we introduce DengueNet, an innovative architecture that combines Vision Transformer, Radiomics, and Long Short-term Memory to extract and integrate spatiotemporal features from satellite images. This enables dengue predictions on an epi-week basis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on five municipalities in Colombia. We utilized a dataset comprising 780 high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images for training and evaluation. The performance of DengueNet was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE) metric. Across the five municipalities, DengueNet achieved an average MAE of 43.92. Our findings strongly support the efficacy of satellite imagery as a valuable resource for dengue prediction, particularly in informing public health policies within countries where manually collected data is scarce and dengue virus prevalence is severe.

Existing works, though making promising progress with the advent of diffusion models, heavily rely on meticulously captured and annotated (e.g., text) high-quality motion corpus, a resource-intensive endeavor in the real world. This motivates our proposed MotionMix, a simple yet effective weakly-supervised diffusion model that leverages both noisy and unannotated motion sequences. Specifically, we separate the denoising objectives of a diffusion model into two stages: obtaining conditional rough motion approximations in the initial $T-T^*$ steps by learning the noisy annotated motions, followed by the unconditional refinement of these preliminary motions during the last $T^*$ steps using unannotated motions. Notably, though learning from two sources of imperfect data, our model does not compromise motion generation quality compared to fully supervised approaches that access gold data. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our MotionMix, as a versatile framework, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performances on text-to-motion, action-to-motion, and music-to-dance tasks.

        "abstract": "The image-level label has prevailed in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks due to its easy availability. Since image-level labels can only indicate the existence or absence of specific categories of objects, visualization-based techniques have been widely adopted to provide object location clues. Considering class activation maps (CAMs) can only locate the most discriminative part of objects, recent approaches usually adopt an expansion strategy to enlarge the activation area for more integral object localization. However, without proper constraints, the expanded activation will easily intrude into the background region. In this paper, we propose spatial structure constraints (SSC) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation to alleviate the unwanted object over-activation of attention expansion. Specifically, we propose a CAM-driven reconstruction module to directly reconstruct the input image from deep CAM features, which constrains the diffusion of last-layer object attention by preserving the coarse spatial structure of the image content. Moreover, we propose an activation self-modulation module to refine CAMs with finer spatial structure details by enhancing regional consistency. Without external saliency models to provide background clues, our approach achieves 72.7\\% and 47.0\\% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed approach.

        "abstract": "Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is known to be an effective solver for many sparse symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems. For SPD systems, the convergence theory of AMG is well-understood in terms of the $A$-norm but in a nonsymmetric setting such an energy norm is non-existent. For this reason, convergence of AMG for nonsymmetric systems of equations remains an open area of research. Existing nonsymmetric AMG algorithms in this setting mostly rely on heuristics motivated by SPD convergence theory. In the SPD setting, the classical form of optimal AMG interpolation provides a useful insight in determining the two grid convergence rate of the method. In this work, we discuss a generalization of the optimal AMG convergence theory targeting nonsymmetric problems by constructing a $2\\times 2$ block symmetric indefinite system so that the Petrov-Galerkin AMG process for the nonsymmetric matrix $A$ can be recast as a Galerkin AMG process for a symmetric indefinite system. We show that using this generalization of the optimal interpolation theory, one can obtain the same identity for the two-grid convergence rate as that derived in the SPD setting for optimal interpolation. We also provide supporting numerical results for the convergence result and nonsymmetric advection-diffusion problems. "

        "abstract": "While third-party libraries are extensively reused to enhance productivity during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis, proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from 59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product Black Duck.

We discovered that, although ChatGPT provides correct answers in 68% of the cases, only around half of those are legible solutions which can benefit students in some form. On the other hand, ChatGPT has a very good ability to perform code review on student programming homework. Based on these findings, we discuss the pros and cons of ChatGPT in education. "

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11170",
        "abstract": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved exceptional performance across various multi-modal tasks. However, the deployment of VLMs necessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once attackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time (energy-latency cost) during inference of VLMs, it will exhaust computational resources. In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of VLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We find that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated by maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose verbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to induce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design three loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of end-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop generating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity loss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the diversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which can break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance these losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can increase the length of generated sequences by 7.87 times and 8.56 times compared to original images on MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets, which presents potential challenges for various applications.

However, existing LLM deployment practices often overlook the distinct characteristics of these phases, leading to significant interference. To mitigate interference, our insight is to carefully schedule and group inference requests based on their characteristics. We realize this idea in TetriInfer through three pillars. First, it partitions prompts into fixed-size chunks so that the accelerator always runs close to its computationsaturated limit. Second, it disaggregates prefill and decode instances so each can run independently. Finally, it uses a smart two-level scheduling algorithm augmented with predicted resource usage to avoid decode scheduling hotspots. Results show that TetriInfer improves time-to-first-token (TTFT), job completion time (JCT), and inference efficiency in turns of performance per dollar by a large margin, e.g., it uses 38% less resources all the while lowering average TTFT and average JCT by 97% and 47%, respectively.

To understand how these models impact adversarial question writing process, we enrich the writing guidance with LLMs and retrieval models for the authors to reason why their questions are not adversarial. While authors could create interesting, challenging adversarial questions, they sometimes resort to tricks that result in poor questions that are ambiguous, subjective, or confusing not just to a computer but also to humans. To address these issues, we propose new metrics and incentives for eliciting good, challenging questions and present a new dataset of adversarially authored questions. "

        "abstract": "Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) can enhance average retrieval effectiveness over a sufficiently large number of queries. However, PRF often introduces a drift into the original information need, thus hurting the retrieval effectiveness of several queries. While a selective application of PRF can potentially alleviate this issue, previous approaches have largely relied on unsupervised or feature-based learning to determine whether a query should be expanded. In contrast, we revisit the problem of selective PRF from a deep learning perspective, presenting a model that is entirely data-driven and trained in an end-to-end manner. The proposed model leverages a transformer-based bi-encoder architecture. Additionally, to further improve retrieval effectiveness with this selective PRF approach, we make use of the model's confidence estimates to combine the information from the original and expanded queries. In our experiments, we apply this selective feedback on a number of different combinations of ranking and feedback models, and show that our proposed approach consistently improves retrieval effectiveness for both sparse and dense ranking models, with the feedback models being either sparse, dense or generative.

However, such over-specialized model designs incur redundant parameters, thus limiting the broader applicability of 3D SOT task. This paper first introduces unified models that can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a single network with shared model parameters. Specifically, we propose to explicitly encode distinct attributes associated to different object categories, enabling the model to adapt to cross-category data. We find that the attribute variances of point cloud objects primarily occur from the varying size and shape (e.g., large and square vehicles v.s. small and slender humans). Based on this observation, we design a novel point set representation learning network inheriting transformer architecture, termed AdaFormer, which adaptively encodes the dynamically varying shape and size information from cross-category data in a unified manner. We further incorporate the size and shape prior derived from the known template targets into the model's inputs and learning objective, facilitating the learning of unified representation. Equipped with such designs, we construct two category-unified models SiamCUT and MoCUT.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiamCUT and MoCUT exhibit strong generalization and training stability. Furthermore, our category-unified models outperform the category-specific counterparts by a significant margin (e.g., on KITTI dataset, 12% and 3% performance gains on the Siamese and motion paradigms).

A pivotal factor in the success of current LLMs is the alignment process. Current alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus on training-time alignment and are often complex and cumbersome to implement. Therefore, we develop \\textbf{InferAligner}, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. InferAligner utilizes safety steering vectors extracted from safety-aligned model to modify the activations of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, thereby guiding the target model to provide harmless responses. Experimental results show that our method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance, medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining almost unchanged performance in downstream tasks. "

Due to the strong generative power of the diffusion prior,we can generate realistic clothes shadows and wrinkles.2)Static Characteristics Transformation: High-frequency Map(HF-Map)is our fundamental insight for static representation.PLTON first warps in-shop clothes to the target model pose by a traditional warping network,and uses a high-pass filter to extract an HF-Map for preserving static cloth features.The HF-Map is used to generate modulation maps through our static extractor,which are injected into a fixed U-net to synthesize the final result.To enhance retention,a Two-stage Blended Denoising method is proposed to guide the diffusion process for correct spatial layout and color.PLTON is finetuned only with our collected small-size try-on dataset.Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on 1024 768 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework in mimicking real clothes dynamics.

In this paper, we present CaraServe, a system that efficiently serves many LoRA adapters derived from a common base model. CaraServe maintains the base model on GPUs and dynamically loads activated LoRA adapters from main memory. As GPU loading results in a cold-start that substantially delays token generation, CaraServe employs a CPU-assisted approach. It early starts the activated adapters on CPUs for prefilling as they are being loaded onto GPUs; after loading completes, it then switches to the GPUs for generative LoRA inference. CaraServe develops a highly optimized synchronization mechanism to efficiently coordinate LoRA computation on the CPU and GPU. Moreover, CaraServe employs a rank-aware scheduling algorithm to optimally schedule heterogeneous LoRA requests for maximum service-level objective (SLO) attainment. We have implemented CaraServe and evaluated it against state-of-the-art LoRA serving systems. Our results demonstrate that CaraServe can speed up the average request serving latency by up to 1.4$\\times$ and achieve an SLO attainment of up to 99%. "

        "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual tasks. However, ViT models suffer from substantial computational and memory requirements, making it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms. Quantization is a popular approach for reducing model size, but most studies mainly focus on equal bit-width quantization for the entire network, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. While there are few works on mixed precision quantization (MPQ) for ViTs, they typically rely on search space-based methods or employ mixed precision arbitrarily. In this paper, we introduce LRP-QViT, an explainability-based method for assigning mixed-precision bit allocations to different layers based on their importance during classification. Specifically, to measure the contribution score of each layer in predicting the target class, we employ the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method. LRP assigns local relevance at the output layer and propagates it through all layers, distributing the relevance until it reaches the input layers. These relevance scores serve as indicators for computing the layer contribution score. Additionally, we have introduced a clipped channel-wise quantization aimed at eliminating outliers from post-LayerNorm activations to alleviate severe inter-channel variations. To validate and assess our approach, we employ LRP-QViT across ViT, DeiT, and Swin transformer models on various datasets. Our experimental findings demonstrate that both our fixed-bit and mixed-bit post-training quantization methods surpass existing models in the context of 4-bit and 6-bit quantization. "

To explore and exemplify this point, we compared vector embeddings from Korean Medicine (KM) and Conventional Medicine (CM) documents, finding that KM document embeddings correlated more with token overlaps and less with human-assessed document relatedness, in contrast to CM embeddings. Prompt-RAG, distinct from conventional RAG models, operates without the need for embedding vectors. Its performance was assessed through a Question-Answering (QA) chatbot application, where responses were evaluated for relevance, readability, and informativeness. The results showed that Prompt-RAG outperformed existing models, including ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding-based RAGs, in terms of relevance and informativeness. Despite challenges like content structuring and response latency, the advancements in LLMs are expected to encourage the use of Prompt-RAG, making it a promising tool for other domains in need of RAG methods.

It generally utilizes additional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervision signals and compress contextual information into dense representations. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-training technique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decoders also incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shed light on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training with enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokens in dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building upon this observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacing the decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Word prediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexical signals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training. Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additional parameters, which provides a 67% training speed-up compared to standard masked auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding.

Two diffusion models conditioned on the Gaussian mixture model are trained separately for comparison. Experiments support our findings. A novel gradient function called the negative Gaussian mixture gradient (NGMG) is proposed and applied in diffusion model training with an additional classifier. Training stability has improved. We also theoretically prove that NGMG shares the same benefit as the Earth Mover distance (Wasserstein) as a more sensible cost function when learning distributions supported by low-dimensional manifolds.

Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by re-training on hyperbolic cluster and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained and fine-tuned LMs, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform both pre-trained and fine-tuned LMs in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.

In this work, we connect the Whisper encoder with ChatGLM3 and provide in-depth comparisons of these two approaches using Chinese automatic speech recognition (ASR) and name entity recognition (NER) tasks. We evaluate them not only by conventional metrics like the F1 score but also by a novel fine-grained taxonomy of ASR-NER errors. Our experiments reveal that encoder-decoder architecture outperforms decoder-only architecture with a short context, while decoder-only architecture benefits from a long context as it fully exploits all layers of the LLM. By using LLM, we significantly reduced the entity omission errors and improved the entity ASR accuracy compared to the Conformer baseline. Additionally, we obtained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) F1 score of 0.805 on the AISHELL-NER test set by using chain-of-thought (CoT) NER which first infers long-form ASR transcriptions and then predicts NER labels.

To implement AGI, the concept of interactive AI (IAI) has been introduced, which can interactively understand and respond not only to human user input but also to dynamic system and network conditions. In this article, we explore an integration and enhancement of IAI in networking. We first comprehensively review recent developments and future perspectives of AI and then introduce the technology and components of IAI. We then explore the integration of IAI into the next-generation networks, focusing on how implicit and explicit interactions can enhance network functionality, improve user experience, and promote efficient network management. Subsequently, we propose an IAI-enabled network management and optimization framework, which consists of environment, perception, action, and brain units. We also design the pluggable large language model (LLM) module and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) module to build the knowledge base and contextual memory for decision-making in the brain unit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through case studies. Finally, we discuss potential research directions for IAI-based networks. "

However, it still remains an open research problem on applying MLLMs to low-level vision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple MLLM-based Image Restoration framework to address this gap, namely Multi-modal Large Language Model based Restoration Assistant (LLMRA). We exploit the impressive capabilities of MLLMs to obtain the degradation information for universal image restoration. By employing a pretrained multi-modal large language model and a vision language model, we generate text descriptions and encode them as context embedding with degradation information for the degraded image. Through the proposed Context Enhance Module (CEM) and Degradation Context based Transformer Network (DC-former), we integrate these context embedding into the restoration network, contributing to more accurate and adjustable image restoration. Based on the dialogue with the users, our method leverages image degradation priors from MLLMs, providing low-level attributes descriptions of the input low-quality images and the restored high-quality images simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our LLMRA in universal image restoration tasks. "

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in video action recognition achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, these models often lack robustness when faced with natural distribution shifts between training and test data. We propose two novel evaluation methods to assess model resilience to such distribution disparity. One method uses two different datasets collected from different sources and uses one for training and validation, and the other for testing. More precisely, we created dataset splits of HMDB-51 or UCF-101 for training, and Kinetics-400 for testing, using the subset of the classes that are overlapping in both train and test datasets. The other proposed method extracts the feature mean of each class from the target evaluation dataset's training data (i.e. class prototype) and estimates test video prediction as a cosine similarity score between each sample to the class prototypes of each target class. This procedure does not alter model weights using the target dataset and it does not require aligning overlapping classes of two different datasets, thus is a very efficient method to test the model robustness to distribution shifts without prior knowledge of the target distribution. We address the robustness problem by adversarial augmentation training - generating augmented views of videos that are \"hard\" for the classification model by applying gradient ascent on the augmentation parameters - as well as \"curriculum\" scheduling the strength of the video augmentations. We experimentally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adversarial augmentation approach over baselines across three state-of-the-art action recognition models - TSM, Video Swin Transformer, and Uniformer. The presented work provides critical insight into model robustness to distribution shifts and presents effective techniques to enhance video action recognition performance in a real-world deployment.

We explore the potential of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DM) in unsupervised learning of the modular attributes. We build a theoretical framework that connects the diffusion time-steps and the hidden attributes, which serves as an effective inductive bias for unsupervised learning. Specifically, the forward diffusion process incrementally adds Gaussian noise to samples at each time-step, which essentially collapses different samples into similar ones by losing attributes, e.g., fine-grained attributes such as texture are lost with less noise added (i.e., early time-steps), while coarse-grained ones such as shape are lost by adding more noise (i.e., late time-steps). To disentangle the modular attributes, at each time-step t, we learn a t-specific feature to compensate for the newly lost attribute, and the set of all 1,...,t-specific features, corresponding to the cumulative set of lost attributes, are trained to make up for the reconstruction error of a pre-trained DM at time-step t. On CelebA, FFHQ, and Bedroom datasets, the learned feature significantly improves attribute classification and enables faithful counterfactual generation, e.g., interpolating only one specified attribute between two images, validating the disentanglement quality.

Therefore, we propose to utilize flow, which represents the future trajectories of 3D points on objects of interest, as an ideal prediction target in robot learning. To exploit scalable data resources, we turn our attention to cross-embodiment datasets. We develop, for the first time, a language-conditioned prediction model directly from large-scale RGBD human video datasets. Our predicted flow offers actionable geometric and physics guidance, thus facilitating stable zero-shot skill transfer in real-world scenarios.We deploy our method with a policy based on closed-loop flow prediction. Remarkably, without any additional training, our method achieves an impressive 81% success rate in human-to-robot skill transfer, covering 18 tasks in 6 scenes. Our framework features the following benefits: (1) scalability: leveraging cross-embodiment data resources; (2) universality: multiple object categories, including rigid, articulated, and soft bodies; (3) stable skill transfer: providing actionable guidance with a small inference domain-gap.

        "abstract": "A vast amount of user behavior data is constantly accumulating on today's large recommendation platforms, recording users' various interests and tastes. Preserving knowledge from the old data while new data continually arrives is a vital problem for recommender systems. Existing approaches generally seek to save the knowledge implicitly in the model parameters. However, such a parameter-centric approach lacks scalability and flexibility -- the capacity is hard to scale, and the knowledge is inflexible to utilize. Hence, in this work, we propose a framework that turns massive user behavior data to retrievable knowledge (D2K). It is a data-centric approach that is model-agnostic and easy to scale up. Different from only storing unary knowledge such as the user-side or item-side information, D2K propose to store ternary knowledge for recommendation, which is determined by the complete recommendation factors -- user, item, and context. The knowledge retrieved by target samples can be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation algorithms. Specifically, we introduce a Transformer-based knowledge encoder to transform the old data into knowledge with the user-item-context cross features. A personalized knowledge adaptation unit is devised to effectively exploit the information from the knowledge base by adapting the retrieved knowledge to the target samples. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that D2K significantly outperforms existing baselines and is compatible with a major collection of recommendation algorithms. "

This model has three states, Susceptible, Believer, and Fact-Checker. The dynamics and transition between states are based on neighbors' beliefs, hoax credibility, spreading rate, probability of verifying the news, and probability of forgetting the current state. Our contribution is to push this model to real social networks by considering different classes of agents with their characteristics. We proposed two main strategies for confronting misinformation diffusion. First, we can educate a minor class, like scholars or influencers, to improve their ability to verify the news or remember their state longer.

However, the resource-intensive nature of existing VLMs poses a significant challenge. We need an accessible method for developing the next generation of VLMs. To address this issue, we propose Zoom-shot, a novel method for transferring the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP to any pre-trained vision encoder. We do this by exploiting the multimodal information (i.e. text and image) present in the CLIP latent space through the use of specifically designed multimodal loss functions. These loss functions are (1) cycle-consistency loss and (2) our novel prompt-guided knowledge distillation loss (PG-KD). PG-KD combines the concept of knowledge distillation with CLIP's zero-shot classification, to capture the interactions between text and image features. With our multimodal losses, we train a $\\textbf{linear mapping}$ between the CLIP latent space and the latent space of a pre-trained vision encoder, for only a $\\textbf{single epoch}$. Furthermore, Zoom-shot is entirely unsupervised and is trained using $\\textbf{unpaired}$ data. We test the zero-shot capabilities of a range of vision encoders augmented as new VLMs, on coarse and fine-grained classification datasets, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art in this problem domain. In our ablations, we find Zoom-shot allows for a trade-off between data and compute during training; and our state-of-the-art results can be obtained by reducing training from 20% to 1% of the ImageNet training data with 20 epochs.

While several variants of Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown great potential as alternatives to modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for centralized training, the unprecedented size and higher computational demands hinder their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, challenging their widespread application in FL. Since client devices in FL typically have limited computing resources and communication bandwidth, models intended for such devices must strike a balance between model size, computational efficiency, and the ability to adapt to the diverse and non-IID data distributions encountered in FL. To address these challenges, we propose OnDev-LCT: Lightweight Convolutional Transformers for On-Device vision tasks with limited training data and resources. Our models incorporate image-specific inductive biases through the LCT tokenizer by leveraging efficient depthwise separable convolutions in residual linear bottleneck blocks to extract local features, while the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism in the LCT encoder implicitly facilitates capturing global representations of images. Extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets indicate that our models outperform existing lightweight vision models while having fewer parameters and lower computational demands, making them suitable for FL scenarios with data heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks.

Our approach mitigates forgetting in continual and offline reinforcement learning scenarios. Moreover, P2DT leverages trajectories collected via traditional reinforcement learning from all tasks and generates new task-specific tokens during training, thereby retaining knowledge from previous studies. Preliminary results demonstrate that our model effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and scales well with increasing task environments. "

Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

By using the intermediate layers as distillation target, we can more effectively distil LM knowledge into the lower network layers. Using our method, we achieve better recognition accuracy than with shallow fusion of an external LM, allowing us to maintain fast parallel decoding.

We propose Hierarchical Geometric Guidance (HGG) to incorporate the attachment of Structure from Motion (SfM), namely sparse depth prior, into the scene representations. Different from direct depth supervision, HGG samples volume points from local-to-global geometric regions, mitigating the misalignment caused by inherent bias in the depth prior. Furthermore, we draw inspiration from notable variations in semantic consistency observed across images of different resolutions and propose Hierarchical Semantic Guidance (HSG) to learn the coarse-to-fine semantic content, which corresponds to the coarse-to-fine scene representations. Experimental results demonstrate that HG3-NeRF can outperform other state-of-the-art methods on different standard benchmarks and achieve high-fidelity synthesis results for sparse view inputs. "

        "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection in large-scale outdoor scenes, characterized by considerable variations in object scales, necessitates features rich in both long-range and fine-grained information. While recent detectors have utilized window-based transformers to model long-range dependencies, they tend to overlook fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose MsSVT++, an innovative Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer that simultaneously captures both types of information through a divide-and-conquer approach. This approach involves explicitly dividing attention heads into multiple groups, each responsible for attending to information within a specific range. The outputs of these groups are subsequently merged to obtain final mixed-scale features. To mitigate the computational complexity associated with applying a window-based transformer in 3D voxel space, we introduce a novel Chessboard Sampling strategy and implement voxel sampling and gathering operations sparsely using a hash map. Moreover, an important challenge stems from the observation that non-empty voxels are primarily located on the surface of objects, which impedes the accurate estimation of bounding boxes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Center Voting module that integrates newly voted voxels enriched with mixed-scale contextual information towards the centers of the objects, thereby improving precise object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our single-stage detector, built upon the foundation of MsSVT++, consistently delivers exceptional performance across diverse datasets. "

        "abstract": "Few-shot hyperspectral image classification aims to identify the classes of each pixel in the images by only marking few of these pixels. And in order to obtain the spatial-spectral joint features of each pixel, the fixed-size patches centering around each pixel are often used for classification. However, observing the classification results of existing methods, we found that boundary patches corresponding to the pixels which are located at the boundary of the objects in the hyperspectral images, are hard to classify. These boundary patchs are mixed with multi-class spectral information. Inspired by this, we propose to augment the prototype network with TransMix for few-shot hyperspectrial image classification(APNT). While taking the prototype network as the backbone, it adopts the transformer as feature extractor to learn the pixel-to-pixel relation and pay different attentions to different pixels. At the same time, instead of directly using the patches which are cut from the hyperspectral images for training, it randomly mixs up two patches to imitate the boundary patches and uses the synthetic patches to train the model, with the aim to enlarge the number of hard training samples and enhance their diversity. And by following the data agumentation technique TransMix, the attention returned by the transformer is also used to mix up the labels of two patches to generate better labels for synthetic patches. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has demonstrated sate of the art performance and better robustness for few-shot hyperspectral image classification in our experiments. "

        "abstract": "Symbols (or more broadly, non-natural language textual representations) such as numerical sequences, molecular formulas, and table delimiters widely exist, playing important roles in various tasks such as abstract reasoning, chemical property prediction, and table question answering. Despite the impressive natural language comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their reasoning abilities for symbols remain inadequate, which could attributed to the difference between symbol representations and general natural languages. We propose symbol-to-language (S2L), a tuning-free method that enables large language models to solve symbol-related problems with information expressed in natural language. Specifically, S2L first converts the symbols involved to language-based representations, which can be implemented by prompting LLMs or leveraging external tools, then these language-based representations are integrated into the original problem via direct substitution or concatenation, serving as useful input information for LLMs. We evaluate the S2L method using both API-based (GPT-4, ChatGPT) and open-source (OpenChat) models over eight symbol-related tasks, ranging from symbol-only abstract reasoning to sentiment analysis in social media. Experimental results show that S2L consistently leads to superior performance. For example, by employing S2L for GPT-4, there can be average significant improvements of +21.9% and +9.5% for subtasks in 1D-ARC and Dyck language, respectively.

However, generating fine-grained segmentation masks with diffusion models often requires additional training on annotated datasets, leaving it unclear to what extent pre-trained diffusion models alone understand the semantic relations of their generated images. To address this question, we leverage the semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) and aim to develop an image segmentor capable of generating fine-grained segmentation maps without any additional training. The primary difficulty stems from the fact that semantically meaningful feature maps typically exist only in the spatially lower-dimensional layers, which poses a challenge in directly extracting pixel-level semantic relations from these feature maps. To overcome this issue, our framework identifies semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps by exploiting SD's generation process and utilizes them for constructing image-resolution segmentation maps. In extensive experiments, the produced segmentation maps are demonstrated to be well delineated and capture detailed parts of the images, indicating the existence of highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models.

To address the issues, we propose a Semantic Prompt Learning for WSSS (SemPLeS) framework, which learns to effectively prompt the CLIP space to enhance the semantic alignment between the segmented regions and the target object categories. More specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning and Class-associated Semantic Refinement to learn the prompts that adequately describe and suppress the image backgrounds associated with each target object category. In this way, our proposed framework is able to perform better semantic matching between object regions and the associated text labels, resulting in desired pseudo masks for training the segmentation model. The proposed SemPLeS framework achieves SOTA performance on the standard WSSS benchmarks, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, and demonstrated interpretability with the semantic visualization of our learned prompts.

There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs. "

Traditional image binarization techniques usually rely on histograms or local statistics to identify a valid threshold to differentiate between different aspects of the image. Deep learning techniques are able to generate binarized versions of the images by learning context-dependent features that are less error-prone to degradation typically occurring in document images. In recent years, many deep learning-based methods have been developed for document binarization. But which one to choose? There have been no studies that compare these methods rigorously. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of different deep learning-based methods under the same evaluation protocol. We evaluate them on different Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets and obtain very heterogeneous results. We show that the DE-GAN model was able to perform better compared to other models when evaluated on the DIBCO2013 dataset while DP-LinkNet performed best on the DIBCO2017 dataset. The 2-StageGAN performed best on the DIBCO2018 dataset while SauvolaNet outperformed the others on the DIBCO2019 challenge.

        "abstract": "Various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in analyzing data in non-Euclidean spaces, however, they have limitations such as oversmoothing, i.e., information becomes excessively averaged as the number of hidden layers increases. The issue stems from the intrinsic formulation of conventional graph convolution where the nodal features are aggregated from a direct neighborhood per layer across the entire nodes in the graph. As setting different number of hidden layers per node is infeasible, recent works leverage a diffusion kernel to redefine the graph structure and incorporate information from farther nodes. Unfortunately, such approaches suffer from heavy diagonalization of a graph Laplacian or learning a large transform matrix. In this regards, we propose a diffusion learning framework, where the range of feature aggregation is controlled by the scale of a diffusion kernel. For efficient computation, we derive closed-form derivatives of approximations of the graph convolution with respect to the scale, so that node-wise range can be adaptively learned. With a downstream classifier, the entire framework is made trainable in an end-to-end manner. Our model is tested on various standard datasets for node-wise classification for the state-of-the-art performance, and it is also validated on a real-world brain network data for graph classifications to demonstrate its practicality for Alzheimer classification.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11929",
        "abstract": "Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, distinguished by its focus on extensive input sequences, in contrast to the constrained lengths typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently convey richer information, potentially enhancing predictive precision, prevailing techniques often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, incorporating parameter-intensive elements like positional encodings, feed-forward networks and self-attention mechanisms. This complexity, however, leads to prohibitive model scale, particularly given the time series data's semantic simplicity. Motivated by the pursuit of parsimony, our research employs conditional correlation and auto-correlation as investigative tools, revealing significant redundancies within the input data. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the HDformer, a lightweight Transformer variant enhanced with hierarchical decomposition. This novel architecture not only inverts the prevailing trend toward model expansion but also accomplishes precise forecasting with drastically fewer computations and parameters. Remarkably, HDformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art LTSF models, while requiring over 99\\% fewer parameters. Through this work, we advocate a paradigm shift in LTSF, emphasizing the importance to tailor the model to the inherent dynamics of time series data-a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.

        "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11949",
        "abstract": "Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) aims to evaluate image quality in line with human perception, without reference benchmarks. Currently, deep learning BIQA methods typically depend on using features from high-level tasks for transfer learning. However, the inherent differences between BIQA and these high-level tasks inevitably introduce noise into the quality-aware features. In this paper, we take an initial step towards exploring the diffusion model for feature denoising in BIQA, namely Perceptual Feature Diffusion for IQA (PFD-IQA), which aims to remove noise from quality-aware features. Specifically, (i) We propose a {Perceptual Prior Discovery and Aggregation module to establish two auxiliary tasks to discover potential low-level features in images that are used to aggregate perceptual text conditions for the diffusion model. (ii) We propose a Perceptual Prior-based Feature Refinement strategy, which matches noisy features to predefined denoising trajectories and then performs exact feature denoising based on text conditions. Extensive experiments on eight standard BIQA datasets demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art BIQA methods, i.e., achieving the PLCC values of 0.935 ( vs. 0.905 in KADID) and 0.922 ( vs. 0.894 in LIVEC).

This survey focuses on the former, by discussing existing efforts towards detecting claims needing fact-checking, with a particular focus on multilingual data and methods. This is a challenging and fertile direction where existing methods are yet far from matching human performance due to the profoundly challenging nature of the issue. Especially, the dissemination of information across multiple social platforms, articulated in multiple languages and modalities demands more generalized solutions for combating misinformation. Focusing on multilingual misinformation, we present a comprehensive survey of existing multilingual claim detection research. We present state-of-the-art multilingual claim detection research categorized into three key factors of the problem, verifiability, priority, and similarity. Further, we present a detailed overview of the existing multilingual datasets along with the challenges and suggest possible future advancements. "

It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data. "

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their unparalleled ability to perform various natural language processing tasks. These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations. Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.

However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why this happens or what factors will influence its choice. In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and model-dependent. We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, \\textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that \\textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a simple and effective recipe for ICL. Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods.

        "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) has consistently demonstrated superior performance over zero-shot performance in large language models (LLMs). However, the understanding of the dynamics of ICL and the aspects that influence downstream performance remains limited, especially for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. This work aims to address this gap by investigating the ICL capabilities of LLMs and studying the impact of different aspects of the in-context demonstrations for the task of machine translation (MT). Our preliminary investigations aim to discern whether in-context learning (ICL) is predominantly influenced by demonstrations or instructions by applying diverse perturbations to in-context demonstrations while preserving the task instruction. We observe varying behavior to perturbed examples across different model families, notably with BLOOM-7B derivatives being severely influenced by noise, whereas Llama 2 derivatives not only exhibit robustness but also tend to show enhancements over the clean baseline when subject to perturbed demonstrations. This suggests that the robustness of ICL may be governed by several factors, including the type of noise, perturbation direction (source or target), the extent of pretraining of the specific model, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks if applicable. Further investigation is warranted to develop a comprehensive understanding of these factors in future research. "

These models integrate verbal and visual information, opening new possibilities to demonstrate more complex reasoning abilities at the intersection of the two modalities. However, despite the revolutionizing prospect of MLLMs, our understanding of their reasoning abilities is limited. In this study, we assess the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of open-source and closed-source MLLMs using variations of Raven's Progressive Matrices. Our experiments expose the difficulty of solving such problems while showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We also reveal critical shortcomings with individual visual and textual modules, subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings. Finally, to improve MLLMs' performance, we experiment with various methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, resulting in a significant (up to 100%) boost in performance. "

In this work, we present \\sys{}, a system that utilizes large language models (LLM) while still promoting students' cognitive engagement. \\sys{} provides a personalized Parsons puzzle to support struggling students. In a Parsons puzzle, students place mixed-up code blocks in the correct order to solve a problem. A technical evaluation with 800 incorrect student code demonstrated that \\sys{} can efficiently create high-quality (correct, personalized, and concise) Parsons puzzles for students. In a within-subjects experiment with 18 novice programmers, most students rated using \\sys{} as more engaging, and they preferred \\sys{} for learning rather than simply receiving an AI-generated solution. Additionally, students recalled more new elements from the supported practice to the posttest after using \\sys{}, compared to when they simply received a direct solution. Qualitative observations and interviews provided evidence for the benefits of \\sys{} including emphasizing algorithmic thinking, fostering continuity in learning, promoting metacognitive reflection, and boosting student confidence.

In this work, we study the universality of individual neurons across GPT2 models trained from different initial random seeds, motivated by the hypothesis that universal neurons are likely to be interpretable. In particular, we compute pairwise correlations of neuron activations over 100 million tokens for every neuron pair across five different seeds and find that 1-5\\% of neurons are universal, that is, pairs of neurons which consistently activate on the same inputs. We then study these universal neurons in detail, finding that they usually have clear interpretations and taxonomize them into a small number of neuron families. We conclude by studying patterns in neuron weights to establish several universal functional roles of neurons in simple circuits: deactivating attention heads, changing the entropy of the next token distribution, and predicting the next token to (not) be within a particular set.

        "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs exploit failures in the reward model (RM) to achieve seemingly high rewards without meeting the underlying objectives. We identify two primary challenges when designing RMs to mitigate reward hacking: distribution shifts during the RL process and inconsistencies in human preferences. As a solution, we propose Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), first fine-tuning multiple RMs, then averaging them in the weight space. This strategy follows the observation that fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same pre-training. By averaging weights, WARM improves efficiency compared to the traditional ensembling of predictions, while improving reliability under distribution shifts and robustness to preference inconsistencies. Our experiments on summarization tasks, using best-of-N and RL methods, shows that WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions; for example, a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM has a 79.4% win rate against a policy RL fine-tuned with a single RM.

Moreover, with the rise of public interest in large language models (LLMs), Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) has rapidly gained traction as a business model. This is not without outstanding security risks, as previous research has demonstrated that sensitive data can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model that generated them. However, such work is limited by its sole focus on English, leaving all other languages vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. %As many international and multilingual companies leverage EaaS, there is an urgent need for research into multilingual LLM security. To this end, this work investigates LLM security from the perspective of multilingual embedding inversion. Concretely, we define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with special attention to a cross-domain scenario. Our findings reveal that multilingual models are potentially more vulnerable to inversion attacks than their monolingual counterparts. This stems from the reduced data requirements for achieving comparable inversion performance in settings where the underlying language is not known a-priori. To our knowledge, this work is the first to delve into multilinguality within the context of inversion attacks, and our findings highlight the need for further investigation and enhanced defenses in the area of NLP Security.

In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future research. "

        "abstract": "Forecasting speculative stock prices is essential for effective investment risk management that drives the need for the development of innovative algorithms. However, the speculative nature, volatility, and complex sequential dependencies within financial markets present inherent challenges which necessitate advanced techniques. This paper proposes a novel framework, CAB-XDE (customized attention BiLSTM-XGB decision ensemble), for predicting the daily closing price of speculative stock Bitcoin-USD (BTC-USD). CAB-XDE framework integrates a customized bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with the attention mechanism and the XGBoost algorithm. The customized BiLSTM leverages its learning capabilities to capture the complex sequential dependencies and speculative market trends. Additionally, the new attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights to influential features, thereby enhancing interpretability, and optimizing effective cost measures and volatility forecasting. Moreover, XGBoost handles nonlinear relationships and contributes to the proposed CAB-XDE framework robustness. Additionally, the weight determination theory-error reciprocal method further refines predictions. This refinement is achieved by iteratively adjusting model weights. It is based on discrepancies between theoretical expectations and actual errors in individual customized attention BiLSTM and XGBoost models to enhance performance. Finally, the predictions from both XGBoost and customized attention BiLSTM models are concatenated to achieve diverse prediction space and are provided to the ensemble classifier to enhance the generalization capabilities of CAB-XDE. The proposed CAB-XDE framework is empirically validated on volatile Bitcoin market, sourced from Yahoo Finance and outperforms state-of-the-art models with a MAPE of 0.0037, MAE of 84.40, and RMSE of 106.14.

        "abstract": "Given the broad application of infrared technology across diverse fields, there is an increasing emphasis on investigating super-resolution techniques for infrared images within the realm of deep learning. Despite the impressive results of current Transformer-based methods in image super-resolution tasks, their reliance on the self-attentive mechanism intrinsic to the Transformer architecture results in images being treated as one-dimensional sequences, thereby neglecting their inherent two-dimensional structure. Moreover, infrared images exhibit a uniform pixel distribution and a limited gradient range, posing challenges for the model to capture effective feature information. Consequently, we suggest a potent Transformer model, termed Large Kernel Transformer (LKFormer), to address this issue. Specifically, we have designed a Large Kernel Residual Depth-wise Convolutional Attention (LKRDA) module with linear complexity. This mainly employs depth-wise convolution with large kernels to execute non-local feature modeling, thereby substituting the standard self-attentive layer. Additionally, we have devised a novel feed-forward network structure called Gated-Pixel Feed-Forward Network (GPFN) to augment the LKFormer's capacity to manage the information flow within the network. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that our method surpasses the most advanced techniques available, using fewer parameters and yielding considerably superior performance. "
