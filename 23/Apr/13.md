**Title:** Boosting Cross-task Transferability of Adversarial Patches with Visual  Relations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05402

**Abstract:** The transferability of adversarial examples is a crucial aspect of evaluating the robustness of deep learning systems, particularly in black-box scenarios. Although several methods have been proposed to enhance cross-model transferability, little attention has been paid to the transferability of adversarial examples across different tasks. This issue has become increasingly relevant with the emergence of foundational multi-task AI systems such as Visual ChatGPT, rendering the utility of adversarial samples generated by a single task relatively limited. Furthermore, these systems often entail inferential functions beyond mere recognition-like tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel Visual Relation-based cross-task Adversarial Patch generation method called VRAP, which aims to evaluate the robustness of various visual tasks, especially those involving visual reasoning, such as Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning. VRAP employs scene graphs to combine object recognition-based deception with predicate-based relations elimination, thereby disrupting the visual reasoning information shared among inferential tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VRAP significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of black-box transferability across diverse visual reasoning tasks. 

**Title:** Galactic ChitChat: Using Large Language Models to Converse with  Astronomy Literature  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05406

**Abstract:** We demonstrate the potential of the state-of-the-art OpenAI GPT-4 large language model to engage in meaningful interactions with Astronomy papers using in-context prompting. To optimize for efficiency, we employ a distillation technique that effectively reduces the size of the original input paper by 50\%, while maintaining the paragraph structure and overall semantic integrity. We then explore the model's responses using a multi-document context (ten distilled documents). Our findings indicate that GPT-4 excels in the multi-document domain, providing detailed answers contextualized within the framework of related research findings. Our results showcase the potential of large language models for the astronomical community, offering a promising avenue for further exploration, particularly the possibility of utilizing the models for hypothesis generation. 

**Title:** Chatbots and ChatGPT: A Bibliometric Analysis and Systematic Review of  Publications in Web of Science and Scopus Databases  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05436

**Abstract:** This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature related to chatbots, focusing specifically on ChatGPT. Chatbots have gained increasing attention recently, with an annual growth rate of 19.16% and 27.19% on the Web of Sciences (WoS) and Scopus, respectively. In this study, we have explored the structure, conceptual evolution, and trends in this field by analyzing data from both Scopus and WoS databases. The research consists of two study phases: (i) an analysis of chatbot literature and (ii) a comprehensive review of scientific documents on ChatGPT. In the first phase, a bibliometric analysis is conducted on all published literature, including articles, book chapters, conference papers, and reviews on chatbots from both Scopus (5839) and WoS (2531) databases covering the period from 1998 to 2023. An in-depth analysis focusing on sources, countries, authors' impact, and keywords has revealed that ChatGPT is the latest trend in the chatbot field. Consequently, in the second phase, bibliometric analysis has been carried out on ChatGPT publications, and 45 published studies have been analyzed thoroughly based on their methods, novelty, and conclusions. The key areas of interest identified from the study can be classified into three groups: artificial intelligence and related technologies, design and evaluation of conversational agents, and digital technologies and mental health. Overall, the study aims to provide guidelines for researchers to conduct their research more effectively in the field of chatbots and specifically highlight significant areas for future investigation into ChatGPT. 

**Title:** Zero-shot Temporal Relation Extraction with ChatGPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05454

**Abstract:** The goal of temporal relation extraction is to infer the temporal relation between two events in the document. Supervised models are dominant in this task. In this work, we investigate ChatGPT's ability on zero-shot temporal relation extraction. We designed three different prompt techniques to break down the task and evaluate ChatGPT. Our experiments show that ChatGPT's performance has a large gap with that of supervised methods and can heavily rely on the design of prompts. We further demonstrate that ChatGPT can infer more small relation classes correctly than supervised methods. The current shortcomings of ChatGPT on temporal relation extraction are also discussed in this paper. We found that ChatGPT cannot keep consistency during temporal inference and it fails in actively long-dependency temporal inference. 

**Title:** CamDiff: Camouflage Image Augmentation via Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05469

**Abstract:** The burgeoning field of camouflaged object detection (COD) seeks to identify objects that blend into their surroundings. Despite the impressive performance of recent models, we have identified a limitation in their robustness, where existing methods may misclassify salient objects as camouflaged ones, despite these two characteristics being contradictory. This limitation may stem from lacking multi-pattern training images, leading to less saliency robustness. To address this issue, we introduce CamDiff, a novel approach inspired by AI-Generated Content (AIGC) that overcomes the scarcity of multi-pattern training images. Specifically, we leverage the latent diffusion model to synthesize salient objects in camouflaged scenes, while using the zero-shot image classification ability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to prevent synthesis failures and ensure the synthesized object aligns with the input prompt. Consequently, the synthesized image retains its original camouflage label while incorporating salient objects, yielding camouflage samples with richer characteristics. The results of user studies show that the salient objects in the scenes synthesized by our framework attract the user's attention more; thus, such samples pose a greater challenge to the existing COD models. Our approach enables flexible editing and efficient large-scale dataset generation at a low cost. It significantly enhances COD baselines' training and testing phases, emphasizing robustness across diverse domains. Our newly-generated datasets and source code are available at https://github.com/drlxj/CamDiff. 

**Title:** GraphGANFed: A Federated Generative Framework for Graph-Structured  Molecules Towards Efficient Drug Discovery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05498

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated its use in various applications, such as cellular image analysis and molecular discovery. In molecular discovery, a generative adversarial network (GAN), which comprises a discriminator to distinguish generated molecules from existing molecules and a generator to generate new molecules, is one of the premier technologies due to its ability to learn from a large molecular data set efficiently and generate novel molecules that preserve similar properties. However, different pharmaceutical companies may be unwilling or unable to share their local data sets due to the geo-distributed and sensitive nature of molecular data sets, making it impossible to train GANs in a centralized manner. In this paper, we propose a Graph convolutional network in Generative Adversarial Networks via Federated learning (GraphGANFed) framework, which integrates graph convolutional neural Network (GCN), GAN, and federated learning (FL) as a whole system to generate novel molecules without sharing local data sets. In GraphGANFed, the discriminator is implemented as a GCN to better capture features from molecules represented as molecular graphs, and FL is used to train both the discriminator and generator in a distributive manner to preserve data privacy. Extensive simulations are conducted based on the three bench-mark data sets to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of GraphGANFed. The molecules generated by GraphGANFed can achieve high novelty (=100) and diversity (> 0.9). The simulation results also indicate that 1) a lower complexity discriminator model can better avoid mode collapse for a smaller data set, 2) there is a tradeoff among different evaluation metrics, and 3) having the right dropout ratio of the generator and discriminator can avoid mode collapse. 

**Title:** chatIPCC: Grounding Conversational AI in Climate Science  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05510

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, achieving remarkable results in question-answering tasks (QA). However, they still face two major challenges: hallucination and outdated information after the training phase. These challenges take center stage in critical domains like climate change, where obtaining accurate and up-to-date information from reliable sources in a limited time is essential and difficult. To overcome these barriers, one potential solution is to provide LLMs with access to external, scientifically accurate, and robust sources (long-term memory) to continuously update their knowledge and prevent the propagation of inaccurate, incorrect, or outdated information. In this study, we enhanced GPT-4 by integrating the information from the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental (IPCC AR6), the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable source in this domain. We present our conversational AI prototype, available at www.chatclimate.ai/ipcc and demonstrate its ability to answer challenging questions accurately in three different QA scenarios: asking from 1) GPT-4, 2) chatIPCC, and 3) hybrid chatIPCC. The answers and their sources were evaluated by our team of IPCC authors, who used their expert knowledge to score the accuracy of the answers from 1 (very-low) to 5 (very-high). The evaluation showed that the hybrid chatIPCC provided more accurate answers, highlighting the effectiveness of our solution. This approach can be easily scaled for chatbots in specific domains, enabling the delivery of reliable and accurate information. 

**Title:** Training Large Language Models Efficiently with Sparsity and Dataflow  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05511

**Abstract:** Large foundation language models have shown their versatility in being able to be adapted to perform a wide variety of downstream tasks, such as text generation, sentiment analysis, semantic search etc. However, training such large foundational models is a non-trivial exercise that requires a significant amount of compute power and expertise from machine learning and systems experts. As models get larger, these demands are only increasing. Sparsity is a promising technique to relieve the compute requirements for training. However, sparsity introduces new challenges in training the sparse model to the same quality as the dense counterparts. Furthermore, sparsity drops the operation intensity and introduces irregular memory access patterns that makes it challenging to efficiently utilize compute resources. This paper demonstrates an end-to-end training flow on a large language model - 13 billion GPT - using sparsity and dataflow. The dataflow execution model and architecture enables efficient on-chip irregular memory accesses as well as native kernel fusion and pipelined parallelism that helps recover device utilization. We show that we can successfully train GPT 13B to the same quality as the dense GPT 13B model, while achieving an end-end speedup of 4.5x over dense A100 baseline. 

**Title:** MoMo: A shared encoder Model for text, image and multi-Modal  representations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05523

**Abstract:** We propose a self-supervised shared encoder model that achieves strong results on several visual, language and multimodal benchmarks while being data, memory and run-time efficient. We make three key contributions. First, in contrast to most existing works, we use a single transformer with all the encoder layers processing both the text and the image modalities. Second, we propose a stage-wise training strategy where the model is first trained on images, then jointly with unimodal text and image datasets and finally jointly with text and text-image datasets. Third, to preserve information across both the modalities, we propose a training pipeline that learns simultaneously from gradient updates of different modalities at each training update step. The results on downstream text-only, image-only and multimodal tasks show that our model is competitive with several strong models while using fewer parameters and lesser pre-training data. For example, MoMo performs competitively with FLAVA on multimodal (+3.1), image-only (+1.1) and text-only (-0.1) tasks despite having 2/5th the number of parameters and using 1/3rd the image-text training pairs. Finally, we ablate various design choices and further show that increasing model size produces significant performance gains indicating potential for substantial improvements with larger models using our approach. 

**Title:** Distinguishing ChatGPT(-3.5, -4)-generated and human-written papers  through Japanese stylometric analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05534

**Abstract:** Text-generative artificial intelligence (AI), including ChatGPT, equipped with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, from OpenAI, has attracted considerable attention worldwide. In this study, first, we compared Japanese stylometric features generated by GPT (-3.5 and -4) and those written by humans. In this work, we performed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to confirm the classification of 216 texts into three classes (72 academic papers written by 36 single authors, 72 texts generated by GPT-3.5, and 72 texts generated by GPT-4 on the basis of the titles of the aforementioned papers) focusing on the following stylometric features: (1) bigrams of parts-of-speech, (2) bigram of postpositional particle words, (3) positioning of commas, and (4) rate of function words. MDS revealed distinct distributions at each stylometric feature of GPT (-3.5 and -4) and human. Although GPT-4 is more powerful than GPT-3.5 because it has more parameters, both GPT (-3.5 and -4) distributions are likely to overlap. These results indicate that although the number of parameters may increase in the future, AI-generated texts may not be close to that written by humans in terms of stylometric features. Second, we verified the classification performance of random forest (RF) for two classes (GPT and human) focusing on Japanese stylometric features. This study revealed the high performance of RF in each stylometric feature. Furthermore, the RF classifier focusing on the rate of function words achieved 98.1% accuracy. The RF classifier focusing on all stylometric features reached 100% in terms of all performance indexes (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score). This study concluded that at this stage we human discriminate ChatGPT from human limited to Japanese language. 

**Title:** Zoom is what you need: An empirical study of the power of zoom and  spatial biases in image classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538

**Abstract:** Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels. We study six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP and find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we explore the potential and limits of zoom transforms in image classification and uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zoom, we propose a state-of-the-art test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art TTA method. Additionally, we propose ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark where zooming in alone often does not help state-of-the-art models better label images. 

**Title:** Distilling Token-Pruned Pose Transformer for 2D Human Pose Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05548

**Abstract:** Human pose estimation has seen widespread use of transformer models in recent years. Pose transformers benefit from the self-attention map, which captures the correlation between human joint tokens and the image. However, training such models is computationally expensive. The recent token-Pruned Pose Transformer (PPT) solves this problem by pruning the background tokens of the image, which are usually less informative. However, although it improves efficiency, PPT inevitably leads to worse performance than TokenPose due to the pruning of tokens. To overcome this problem, we present a novel method called Distilling Pruned-Token Transformer for human pose estimation (DPPT). Our method leverages the output of a pre-trained TokenPose to supervise the learning process of PPT. We also establish connections between the internal structure of pose transformers and PPT, such as attention maps and joint features. Our experimental results on the MPII datasets show that our DPPT can significantly improve PCK compared to previous PPT models while still reducing computational complexity. 

**Title:** An End-to-End Network for Upright Adjustment of Panoramic Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05556

**Abstract:** Nowadays, panoramic images can be easily obtained by panoramic cameras. However, when the panoramic camera orientation is tilted, a non-upright panoramic image will be captured. Existing upright adjustment models focus on how to estimate more accurate camera orientation, and attribute image reconstruction to offline or post-processing tasks. To this end, we propose an online end-to-end network for upright adjustment. Our network is designed to reconstruct the image while finding the angle. Our network consists of three modules: orientation estimation, LUT online generation, and upright reconstruction. Direction estimation estimates the tilt angle of the panoramic image. Then, a converter block with upsampling function is designed to generate angle to LUT. This module can output corresponding online LUT for different input angles. Finally, a lightweight generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to generate upright images from shallow features. The experimental results show that in terms of angles, we have improved the accuracy of small angle errors. In terms of image reconstruction, In image reconstruction, we have achieved the first real-time online upright reconstruction of panoramic images using deep learning networks. 

**Title:** Improving Diffusion Models for Scene Text Editing with Dual Encoders  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05568

**Abstract:** Scene text editing is a challenging task that involves modifying or inserting specified texts in an image while maintaining its natural and realistic appearance. Most previous approaches to this task rely on style-transfer models that crop out text regions and feed them into image transfer models, such as GANs. However, these methods are limited in their ability to change text style and are unable to insert texts into images. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise in overcoming these limitations with text-conditional image editing. However, our empirical analysis reveals that state-of-the-art diffusion models struggle with rendering correct text and controlling text style. To address these problems, we propose DIFFSTE to improve pre-trained diffusion models with a dual encoder design, which includes a character encoder for better text legibility and an instruction encoder for better style control. An instruction tuning framework is introduced to train our model to learn the mapping from the text instruction to the corresponding image with either the specified style or the style of the surrounding texts in the background. Such a training method further brings our method the zero-shot generalization ability to the following three scenarios: generating text with unseen font variation, e.g., italic and bold, mixing different fonts to construct a new font, and using more relaxed forms of natural language as the instructions to guide the generation task. We evaluate our approach on five datasets and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of text correctness, image naturalness, and style controllability. Our code is publicly available. https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/DiffSTE 

**Title:** Vehicle Trajectory Prediction based Predictive Collision Risk Assessment  for Autonomous Driving in Highway Scenarios  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05610

**Abstract:** For driving safely and efficiently in highway scenarios, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be able to predict future behaviors of surrounding object vehicles (OVs), and assess collision risk accurately for reasonable decision-making. Aiming at autonomous driving in highway scenarios, a predictive collision risk assessment method based on trajectory prediction of OVs is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the vehicle trajectory prediction is formulated as a sequence generation task with long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder framework. Convolutional social pooling (CSP) and graph attention network (GAN) are adopted for extracting local spatial vehicle interactions and distant spatial vehicle interactions, respectively. Then, two basic risk metrics, time-to-collision (TTC) and minimal distance margin (MDM), are calculated between the predicted trajectory of OV and the candidate trajectory of AV. Consequently, a time-continuous risk function is constructed with temporal and spatial risk metrics. Finally, the vehicle trajectory prediction model CSP-GAN-LSTM is evaluated on two public highway datasets. The quantitative results indicate that the proposed CSP-GAN-LSTM model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of position prediction accuracy. Besides, simulation results in typical highway scenarios further validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed predictive collision risk assessment method. 

**Title:** ChatGPT Beyond English: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Large  Language Models in Multilingual Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05613

**Abstract:** Over the last few years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as the most important breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) that fundamentally transform research and developments in the field. ChatGPT represents one of the most exciting LLM systems developed recently to showcase impressive skills for language generation and highly attract public attention. Among various exciting applications discovered for ChatGPT in English, the model can process and generate texts for multiple languages due to its multilingual training data. Given the broad adoption of ChatGPT for English in different problems and areas, a natural question is whether ChatGPT can also be applied effectively for other languages or it is necessary to develop more language-specific technologies. The answer to this question requires a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT over multiple tasks with diverse languages and large datasets (i.e., beyond reported anecdotes), which is still missing or limited in current research. Our work aims to fill this gap for the evaluation of ChatGPT and similar LLMs to provide more comprehensive information for multilingual NLP applications. While this work will be an ongoing effort to include additional experiments in the future, our current paper evaluates ChatGPT on 7 different tasks, covering 37 diverse languages with high, medium, low, and extremely low resources. We also focus on the zero-shot learning setting for ChatGPT to improve reproducibility and better simulate the interactions of general users. Compared to the performance of previous models, our extensive experimental results demonstrate a worse performance of ChatGPT for different NLP tasks and languages, calling for further research to develop better models and understanding for multilingual learning. 

**Title:** NutritionVerse-Thin: An Optimized Strategy for Enabling Improved  Rendering of 3D Thin Food Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05620

**Abstract:** With the growth in capabilities of generative models, there has been growing interest in using photo-realistic renders of common 3D food items to improve downstream tasks such as food printing, nutrition prediction, or management of food wastage. Despite 3D modelling capabilities being more accessible than ever due to the success of NeRF based view-synthesis, such rendering methods still struggle to correctly capture thin food objects, often generating meshes with significant holes. In this study, we present an optimized strategy for enabling improved rendering of thin 3D food models, and demonstrate qualitative improvements in rendering quality. Our method generates the 3D model mesh via a proposed thin-object-optimized differentiable reconstruction method and tailors the strategy at both the data collection and training stages to better handle thin objects. While simple, we find that this technique can be employed for quick and highly consistent capturing of thin 3D objects. 

**Title:** How you feelin'? Learning Emotions and Mental States in Movie Scenes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05634

**Abstract:** Movie story analysis requires understanding characters' emotions and mental states. Towards this goal, we formulate emotion understanding as predicting a diverse and multi-label set of emotions at the level of a movie scene and for each character. We propose EmoTx, a multimodal Transformer-based architecture that ingests videos, multiple characters, and dialog utterances to make joint predictions. By leveraging annotations from the MovieGraphs dataset, we aim to predict classic emotions (e.g. happy, angry) and other mental states (e.g. honest, helpful). We conduct experiments on the most frequently occurring 10 and 25 labels, and a mapping that clusters 181 labels to 26. Ablation studies and comparison against adapted state-of-the-art emotion recognition approaches shows the effectiveness of EmoTx. Analyzing EmoTx's self-attention scores reveals that expressive emotions often look at character tokens while other mental states rely on video and dialog cues. 

**Title:** Generative Adversarial Networks-Driven Cyber Threat Intelligence  Detection Framework for Securing Internet of Things  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05644

**Abstract:** While the benefits of 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) are numerous, providing high-speed, low-latency communication that brings new opportunities for innovation and forms the foundation for continued growth in the IoT industry, it is also important to consider the security challenges and risks associated with the technology. In this paper, we propose a two-stage intrusion detection framework for securing IoTs, which is based on two detectors. In the first stage, we propose an adversarial training approach using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to help the first detector train on robust features by supplying it with adversarial examples as validation sets. Consequently, the classifier would perform very well against adversarial attacks. Then, we propose a deep learning (DL) model for the second detector to identify intrusions. We evaluated the proposed approach's efficiency in terms of detection accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Experiment results with a new cyber security dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in detecting both intrusions and persistent adversarial examples with a weighted avg of 96%, 95%, 95%, and 95% for precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy, respectively. 

**Title:** CLIP Surgery for Better Explainability with Enhancement in  Open-Vocabulary Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05653

**Abstract:** Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a powerful multimodal large vision model that has demonstrated significant benefits for downstream tasks, including many zero-shot learning and text-guided vision tasks. However, we notice some severe problems regarding the model's explainability, which undermines its credibility and impedes related tasks. Specifically, we find CLIP prefers the background regions than the foregrounds according to the predicted similarity map, which contradicts human understanding. Besides, there are obvious noisy activations on the visualization results at irrelevant positions. To address these two issues, we conduct in-depth analyses and reveal the reasons with new findings and evidences. Based on these insights, we propose the CLIP Surgery, a method that enables surgery-like modifications for the inference architecture and features, for better explainability and enhancement in multiple open-vocabulary tasks. The proposed method has significantly improved the explainability of CLIP for both convolutional networks and vision transformers, surpassing existing methods by large margins. Besides, our approach also demonstrates remarkable improvements in open-vocabulary segmentation and multi-label recognition tasks. For examples, the mAP improvement on NUS-Wide multi-label recognition is 4.41% without any additional training, and our CLIP Surgery surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 8.74% at mIoU on Cityscapes open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our method benefits other tasks including multimodal visualization and interactive segmentation like Segment Anything Model (SAM). The code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/CLIP_Surgery 

**Title:** Real-time Trajectory-based Social Group Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05678

**Abstract:** Social group detection is a crucial aspect of various robotic applications, including robot navigation and human-robot interactions. To date, a range of model-based techniques have been employed to address this challenge, such as the F-formation and trajectory similarity frameworks. However, these approaches often fail to provide reliable results in crowded and dynamic scenarios. Recent advancements in this area have mainly focused on learning-based methods, such as deep neural networks that use visual content or human pose. Although visual content-based methods have demonstrated promising performance on large-scale datasets, their computational complexity poses a significant barrier to their practical use in real-time applications. To address these issues, we propose a simple and efficient framework for social group detection. Our approach explores the impact of motion trajectory on social grouping and utilizes a novel, reliable, and fast data-driven method. We formulate the individuals in a scene as a graph, where the nodes are represented by LSTM-encoded trajectories and the edges are defined by the distances between each pair of tracks. Our framework employs a modified graph transformer module and graph clustering losses to detect social groups. Our experiments on the popular JRDBAct dataset reveal noticeable improvements in performance, with relative improvements ranging from 2% to 11%. Furthermore, our framework is significantly faster, with up to 12x faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art methods under the same computation resources. These results demonstrate that our proposed method is suitable for real-time robotic applications. 

**Title:** InterGen: Diffusion-based Multi-human Motion Generation under Complex  Interactions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05684

**Abstract:** We have recently seen tremendous progress in diffusion advances for generating realistic human motions. Yet, they largely disregard the rich multi-human interactions. In this paper, we present InterGen, an effective diffusion-based approach that incorporates human-to-human interactions into the motion diffusion process, which enables layman users to customize high-quality two-person interaction motions, with only text guidance. We first contribute a multimodal dataset, named InterHuman. It consists of about 107M frames for diverse two-person interactions, with accurate skeletal motions and 16,756 natural language descriptions. For the algorithm side, we carefully tailor the motion diffusion model to our two-person interaction setting. To handle the symmetry of human identities during interactions, we propose two cooperative transformer-based denoisers that explicitly share weights, with a mutual attention mechanism to further connect the two denoising processes. Then, we propose a novel representation for motion input in our interaction diffusion model, which explicitly formulates the global relations between the two performers in the world frame. We further introduce two novel regularization terms to encode spatial relations, equipped with a corresponding damping scheme during the training of our interaction diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalizability of InterGen. Notably, it can generate more diverse and compelling two-person motions than previous methods and enables various downstream applications for human interactions. 

**Title:** Multi-scale Geometry-aware Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05694

**Abstract:** Self-attention modules have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in capturing long-range relationships and improving the performance of point cloud tasks. However, point cloud objects are typically characterized by complex, disordered, and non-Euclidean spatial structures with multiple scales, and their behavior is often dynamic and unpredictable. The current self-attention modules mostly rely on dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among query-key-value features, which cannot adequately capture the multi-scale non-Euclidean structures of point cloud objects. To address these problems, this paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, Multi-scale Geometry-aware Transformer (MGT). MGT processes point cloud data with multi-scale local and global geometric information in the following three aspects. At first, the MGT divides point cloud data into patches with multiple scales. Secondly, a local feature extractor based on sphere mapping is proposed to explore the geometry inner each patch and generate a fixed-length representation for each patch. Thirdly, the fixed-length representations are fed into a novel geodesic-based self-attention to capture the global non-Euclidean geometry between patches. Finally, all the modules are integrated into the framework of MGT with an end-to-end training scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the MGT vastly increases the capability of capturing multi-scale geometry using the self-attention mechanism and achieves strong competitive performance on mainstream point cloud benchmarks. 

**Title:** Using Multiple RDF Knowledge Graphs for Enriching ChatGPT Responses  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05774

**Abstract:** There is a recent trend for using the novel Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT chatbox, which provides detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. However, in many cases it returns plausible-sounding but incorrect or inaccurate responses, whereas it does not provide evidence. Therefore, any user has to further search for checking the accuracy of the answer or/and for finding more information about the entities of the response. At the same time there is a high proliferation of RDF Knowledge Graphs (KGs) over any real domain, that offer high quality structured data. For enabling the combination of ChatGPT and RDF KGs, we present a research prototype, called GPToLODS, which is able to enrich any ChatGPT response with more information from hundreds of RDF KGs. In particular, it identifies and annotates each entity of the response with statistics and hyperlinks to LODsyndesis KG (which contains integrated data from 400 RDF KGs and over 412 million entities). In this way, it is feasible to enrich the content of entities and to perform fact checking and validation for the facts of the response at real time. 

**Title:** DUFormer: A Novel Architecture for Power Line Segmentation of Aerial  Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05821

**Abstract:** Power lines pose a significant safety threat to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating at low altitudes. However, detecting power lines in aerial images is challenging due to the small size of the foreground data (i.e., power lines) and the abundance of background information. To address this challenge, we propose DUFormer, a semantic segmentation algorithm designed specifically for power line detection in aerial images. We assume that performing sufficient feature extraction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has a strong inductive bias is beneficial for training an efficient Transformer model. To this end, we propose a heavy token encoder responsible for overlapping feature re-mining and tokenization. The encoder comprises a pyramid CNN feature extraction module and a power line feature enhancement module. Following sufficient feature extraction for power lines, the feature fusion is carried out, and then the Transformer block is used for global modeling. The final segmentation result is obtained by fusing local and global features in the decode head. Additionally, we demonstrate the significance of the joint multi-weight loss function in power line segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in power line segmentation on the publicly available TTPLA dataset. 

**Title:** Exploring Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05841

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the performance of diffusion models for video anomaly detection (VAD) within the most challenging but also the most operational scenario in which the data annotations are not used. As being sparse, diverse, contextual, and often ambiguous, detecting abnormal events precisely is a very ambitious task. To this end, we rely only on the information-rich spatio-temporal data, and the reconstruction power of the diffusion models such that a high reconstruction error is utilized to decide the abnormality. Experiments performed on two large-scale video anomaly detection datasets demonstrate the consistent improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art generative models while in some cases our method achieves better scores than the more complex models. This is the first study using a diffusion model and examining its parameters' influence to present guidance for VAD in surveillance scenarios. 

**Title:** A quadrature scheme for steady-state diffusion equations involving  fractional power of regularly accretive operator  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05848

**Abstract:** In this paper, we construct a quadrature scheme to numerically solve the nonlocal diffusion equation $(\mathcal{A}^\alpha+b\mathcal{I})u=f$ with $\mathcal{A}^\alpha$ the $\alpha$-th power of the regularly accretive operator $\mathcal{A}$. Rigorous error analysis is carried out and sharp error bounds (up to some negligible constants) are obtained. The error estimates include a wide range of cases in which the regularity index and spectral angle of $\mathcal{A}$, the smoothness of $f$, the size of $b$ and $\alpha$ are all involved. The quadrature scheme is exponentially convergent with respect to the step size and is root-exponentially convergent with respect to the number of solves. Some numerical tests are presented in the last section to verify the sharpness of our estimates. Furthermore, both the scheme and the error bounds can be utilized directly to solve and analyze time-dependent problems. 

**Title:** Learning Homographic Disambiguation Representation for Neural Machine  Translation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05860

**Abstract:** Homographs, words with the same spelling but different meanings, remain challenging in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While recent works leverage various word embedding approaches to differentiate word sense in NMT, they do not focus on the pivotal components in resolving ambiguities of homographs in NMT: the hidden states of an encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle homographic issues of NMT in the latent space. We first train an encoder (aka "HDR-encoder") to learn universal sentence representations in a natural language inference (NLI) task. We further fine-tune the encoder using homograph-based synset sentences from WordNet, enabling it to learn word-level homographic disambiguation representations (HDR). The pre-trained HDR-encoder is subsequently integrated with a transformer-based NMT in various schemes to improve translation accuracy. Experiments on four translation directions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the performance of NMT systems in the BLEU scores (up to +2.3 compared to a solid baseline). The effects can be verified by other metrics (F1, precision, and recall) of translation accuracy in an additional disambiguation task. Visualization methods like heatmaps, T-SNE and translation examples are also utilized to demonstrate the effects of the proposed method. 

**Title:** Unicom: Universal and Compact Representation Learning for Image  Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05884

**Abstract:** Modern image retrieval methods typically rely on fine-tuning pre-trained encoders to extract image-level descriptors. However, the most widely used models are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with limited classes. The pre-trained feature representation is therefore not universal enough to generalize well to the diverse open-world classes. In this paper, we first cluster the large-scale LAION400M into one million pseudo classes based on the joint textual and visual features extracted by the CLIP model. Due to the confusion of label granularity, the automatically clustered dataset inevitably contains heavy inter-class conflict. To alleviate such conflict, we randomly select partial inter-class prototypes to construct the margin-based softmax loss. To further enhance the low-dimensional feature representation, we randomly select partial feature dimensions when calculating the similarities between embeddings and class-wise prototypes. The dual random partial selections are with respect to the class dimension and the feature dimension of the prototype matrix, making the classification conflict-robust and the feature embedding compact. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised image retrieval approaches on multiple benchmarks. The code and pre-trained models are released to facilitate future research https://github.com/deepglint/unicom. 

**Title:** Cancer-Net BCa-S: Breast Cancer Grade Prediction using Volumetric Deep  Radiomic Features from Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05899

**Abstract:** The prevalence of breast cancer continues to grow, affecting about 300,000 females in the United States in 2023. However, there are different levels of severity of breast cancer requiring different treatment strategies, and hence, grading breast cancer has become a vital component of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Specifically, the gold-standard Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade has been shown to consistently indicate a patient's response to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the current method to determine the SBR grade requires removal of some cancer cells from the patient which can lead to stress and discomfort along with costly expenses. In this paper, we study the efficacy of deep learning for breast cancer grading based on synthetic correlated diffusion (CDI$^s$) imaging, a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality and found that it achieves better performance on SBR grade prediction compared to those learnt using gold-standard imaging modalities. Hence, we introduce Cancer-Net BCa-S, a volumetric deep radiomics approach for predicting SBR grade based on volumetric CDI$^s$ data. Given the promising results, this proposed method to identify the severity of the cancer would allow for better treatment decisions without the need for a biopsy. Cancer-Net BCa-S has been made publicly available as part of a global open-source initiative for advancing machine learning for cancer care. 

**Title:** Diffusion models with location-scale noise  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05907

**Abstract:** Diffusion Models (DMs) are powerful generative models that add Gaussian noise to the data and learn to remove it. We wanted to determine which noise distribution (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) led to better generated data in DMs. Since DMs do not work by design with non-Gaussian noise, we built a framework that allows reversing a diffusion process with non-Gaussian location-scale noise. We use that framework to show that the Gaussian distribution performs the best over a wide range of other distributions (Laplace, Uniform, t, Generalized-Gaussian). 

**Title:** MED-VT: Multiscale Encoder-Decoder Video Transformer with Application to  Object Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05930

**Abstract:** Multiscale video transformers have been explored in a wide variety of vision tasks. To date, however, the multiscale processing has been confined to the encoder or decoder alone. We present a unified multiscale encoder-decoder transformer that is focused on dense prediction tasks in videos. Multiscale representation at both encoder and decoder yields key benefits of implicit extraction of spatiotemporal features (i.e. without reliance on input optical flow) as well as temporal consistency at encoding and coarseto-fine detection for high-level (e.g. object) semantics to guide precise localization at decoding. Moreover, we propose a transductive learning scheme through many-to-many label propagation to provide temporally consistent predictions. We showcase our Multiscale Encoder-Decoder Video Transformer (MED-VT) on Automatic Video Object Segmentation (AVOS) and actor/action segmentation, where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks using only raw images, without using optical flow. 

**Title:** Explicitly Minimizing the Blur Error of Variational Autoencoders  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05939

**Abstract:** Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative modelling methods, however they suffer from blurry generated samples and reconstructions compared to the images they have been trained on. Significant research effort has been spent to increase the generative capabilities by creating more flexible models but often flexibility comes at the cost of higher complexity and computational cost. Several works have focused on altering the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), however, often at the expense of losing the mathematical link to maximizing the likelihood of the samples under the modeled distribution. Here we propose a new formulation of the reconstruction term for the VAE that specifically penalizes the generation of blurry images while at the same time still maximizing the ELBO under the modeled distribution. We show the potential of the proposed loss on three different data sets, where it outperforms several recently proposed reconstruction losses for VAEs. 

**Title:** SpectralDiff: Hyperspectral Image Classification with Spectral-Spatial  Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05961

**Abstract:** Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is an important topic in the field of remote sensing, and has a wide range of applications in Earth science. HSIs contain hundreds of continuous bands, which are characterized by high dimension and high correlation between adjacent bands. The high dimension and redundancy of HSI data bring great difficulties to HSI classification. In recent years, a large number of HSI feature extraction and classification methods based on deep learning have been proposed. However, their ability to model the global relationships among samples in both spatial and spectral domains is still limited. In order to solve this problem, an HSI classification method with spectral-spatial diffusion models is proposed. The proposed method realizes the reconstruction of spectral-spatial distribution of the training samples with the forward and reverse spectral-spatial diffusion process, thus modeling the global spatial-spectral relationship between samples. Then, we use the spectral-spatial denoising network of the reverse process to extract the unsupervised diffusion features. Features extracted by the spectral-spatial diffusion models can achieve cross-sample perception from the reconstructed distribution of the training samples, thus obtaining better classification performance. Experiments on three public HSI datasets show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods. The source code and the pre-trained spectral-spatial diffusion model will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenning0115/SpectralDiff. 

**Title:** Localizing Model Behavior with Path Patching  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05969

**Abstract:** Localizing behaviors of neural networks to a subset of the network's components or a subset of interactions between components is a natural first step towards analyzing network mechanisms and possible failure modes. Existing work is often qualitative and ad-hoc, and there is no consensus on the appropriate way to evaluate localization claims. We introduce path patching, a technique for expressing and quantitatively testing a natural class of hypotheses expressing that behaviors are localized to a set of paths. We refine an explanation of induction heads, characterize a behavior of GPT-2, and open source a framework for efficiently running similar experiments. 

**Title:** ImageReward: Learning and Evaluating Human Preferences for Text-to-Image  Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05977

**Abstract:** We present ImageReward -- the first general-purpose text-to-image human preference reward model -- to address various prevalent issues in generative models and align them with human values and preferences. Its training is based on our systematic annotation pipeline that covers both the rating and ranking components, collecting a dataset of 137k expert comparisons to date. In human evaluation, ImageReward outperforms existing scoring methods (e.g., CLIP by 38.6\%), making it a promising automatic metric for evaluating and improving text-to-image synthesis. The reward model is publicly available via the \texttt{image-reward} package at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/ImageReward}. 

**Title:** NaviSTAR: Socially Aware Robot Navigation with Hybrid Spatio-Temporal  Graph Transformer and Preference Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05979

**Abstract:** Developing robotic technologies for use in human society requires ensuring the safety of robots' navigation behaviors while adhering to pedestrians' expectations and social norms. However, maintaining real-time communication between robots and pedestrians to avoid collisions can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel socially-aware navigation benchmark called NaviSTAR, which utilizes a hybrid Spatio-Temporal grAph tRansformer (STAR) to understand interactions in human-rich environments fusing potential crowd multi-modal information. We leverage off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm with preference learning to train a policy and a reward function network with supervisor guidance. Additionally, we design a social score function to evaluate the overall performance of social navigation. To compare, we train and test our algorithm and other state-of-the-art methods in both simulator and real-world scenarios independently. Our results show that NaviSTAR outperforms previous methods with outstanding performance\footnote{The source code and experiment videos of this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/san-navistar 

**Title:** Neural Attention Forests: Transformer-Based Forest Improvement  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05980

**Abstract:** A new approach called NAF (the Neural Attention Forest) for solving regression and classification tasks under tabular training data is proposed. The main idea behind the proposed NAF model is to introduce the attention mechanism into the random forest by assigning attention weights calculated by neural networks of a specific form to data in leaves of decision trees and to the random forest itself in the framework of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression. In contrast to the available models like the attention-based random forest, the attention weights and the Nadaraya-Watson regression are represented in the form of neural networks whose weights can be regarded as trainable parameters. The first part of neural networks with shared weights is trained for all trees and computes attention weights of data in leaves. The second part aggregates outputs of the tree networks and aims to minimize the difference between the random forest prediction and the truth target value from a training set. The neural network is trained in an end-to-end manner. The combination of the random forest and neural networks implementing the attention mechanism forms a transformer for enhancing the forest predictions. Numerical experiments with real datasets illustrate the proposed method. The code implementing the approach is publicly available. 

**Title:** APPLeNet: Visual Attention Parameterized Prompt Learning for Few-Shot  Remote Sensing Image Generalization using CLIP  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05995

**Abstract:** In recent years, the success of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP has led to their increased usage in various computer vision tasks. These models enable zero-shot inference through carefully crafted instructional text prompts without task-specific supervision. However, the potential of VLMs for generalization tasks in remote sensing (RS) has not been fully realized. To address this research gap, we propose a novel image-conditioned prompt learning strategy called the Visual Attention Parameterized Prompts Learning Network (APPLeNet). APPLeNet emphasizes the importance of multi-scale feature learning in RS scene classification and disentangles visual style and content primitives for domain generalization tasks. To achieve this, APPLeNet combines visual content features obtained from different layers of the vision encoder and style properties obtained from feature statistics of domain-specific batches. An attention-driven injection module is further introduced to generate visual tokens from this information. We also introduce an anti-correlation regularizer to ensure discrimination among the token embeddings, as this visual information is combined with the textual tokens. To validate APPLeNet, we curated four available RS benchmarks and introduced experimental protocols and datasets for three domain generalization tasks. Our results consistently outperform the relevant literature and code is available at https://github.com/mainaksingha01/APPLeNet 

**Title:** Adaptive Human Matting for Dynamic Videos  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06018

**Abstract:** The most recent efforts in video matting have focused on eliminating trimap dependency since trimap annotations are expensive and trimap-based methods are less adaptable for real-time applications. Despite the latest tripmap-free methods showing promising results, their performance often degrades when dealing with highly diverse and unstructured videos. We address this limitation by introducing Adaptive Matting for Dynamic Videos, termed AdaM, which is a framework designed for simultaneously differentiating foregrounds from backgrounds and capturing alpha matte details of human subjects in the foreground. Two interconnected network designs are employed to achieve this goal: (1) an encoder-decoder network that produces alpha mattes and intermediate masks which are used to guide the transformer in adaptively decoding foregrounds and backgrounds, and (2) a transformer network in which long- and short-term attention combine to retain spatial and temporal contexts, facilitating the decoding of foreground details. We benchmark and study our methods on recently introduced datasets, showing that our model notably improves matting realism and temporal coherence in complex real-world videos and achieves new best-in-class generalizability. Further details and examples are available at https://github.com/microsoft/AdaM. 

**Title:** Generating Aligned Pseudo-Supervision from Non-Aligned Data for Image  Restoration in Under-Display Camera  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06019

**Abstract:** Due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale and perfectly aligned paired training data for Under-Display Camera (UDC) image restoration, previous methods resort to monitor-based image systems or simulation-based methods, sacrificing the realness of the data and introducing domain gaps. In this work, we revisit the classic stereo setup for training data collection -- capturing two images of the same scene with one UDC and one standard camera. The key idea is to "copy" details from a high-quality reference image and "paste" them on the UDC image. While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module (DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views. Extensive experiments show that high-quality and well-aligned pseudo UDC training pairs are beneficial for training a robust restoration network. Code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/jnjaby/AlignFormer. 

**Title:** VidStyleODE: Disentangled Video Editing via StyleGAN and NeuralODEs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06020

**Abstract:** We propose $\textbf{VidStyleODE}$, a spatiotemporally continuous disentangled $\textbf{Vid}$eo representation based upon $\textbf{Style}$GAN and Neural-$\textbf{ODE}$s. Effective traversal of the latent space learned by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been the basis for recent breakthroughs in image editing. However, the applicability of such advancements to the video domain has been hindered by the difficulty of representing and controlling videos in the latent space of GANs. In particular, videos are composed of content (i.e., appearance) and complex motion components that require a special mechanism to disentangle and control. To achieve this, VidStyleODE encodes the video content in a pre-trained StyleGAN $\mathcal{W}_+$ space and benefits from a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input video. Our novel continuous video generation process then combines the two to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos with varying frame rates. We show that our proposed method enables a variety of applications on real videos: text-guided appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation and extrapolation.

**Title:** Probabilistic Human Mesh Recovery in 3D Scenes from Egocentric Views  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06024

**Abstract:** Automatic perception of human behaviors during social interactions is crucial for AR/VR applications, and an essential component is estimation of plausible 3D human pose and shape of our social partners from the egocentric view. One of the biggest challenges of this task is severe body truncation due to close social distances in egocentric scenarios, which brings large pose ambiguities for unseen body parts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel scene-conditioned diffusion method to model the body pose distribution. Conditioned on the 3D scene geometry, the diffusion model generates bodies in plausible human-scene interactions, with the sampling guided by a physics-based collision score to further resolve human-scene inter-penetrations. The classifier-free training enables flexible sampling with different conditions and enhanced diversity. A visibility-aware graph convolution model guided by per-joint visibility serves as the diffusion denoiser to incorporate inter-joint dependencies and per-body-part control. Extensive evaluations show that our method generates bodies in plausible interactions with 3D scenes, achieving both superior accuracy for visible joints and diversity for invisible body parts. The code will be available at https://sanweiliti.github.io/egohmr/egohmr.html. 

**Title:** DreamPose: Fashion Image-to-Video Synthesis via Stable Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06025

**Abstract:** We present DreamPose, a diffusion-based method for generating animated fashion videos from still images. Given an image and a sequence of human body poses, our method synthesizes a video containing both human and fabric motion. To achieve this, we transform a pretrained text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) into a pose-and-image guided video synthesis model, using a novel finetuning strategy, a set of architectural changes to support the added conditioning signals, and techniques to encourage temporal consistency. We fine-tune on a collection of fashion videos from the UBC Fashion dataset. We evaluate our method on a variety of clothing styles and poses, and demonstrate that our method produces state-of-the-art results on fashion video animation. Video results are available on our project page. 

**Title:** Continual Diffusion: Continual Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion  with C-LoRA  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06027

**Abstract:** Recent works demonstrate a remarkable ability to customize text-to-image diffusion models while only providing a few example images. What happens if you try to customize such models using multiple, fine-grained concepts in a sequential (i.e., continual) manner? In our work, we show that recent state-of-the-art customization of text-to-image models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when new concepts arrive sequentially. Specifically, when adding a new concept, the ability to generate high quality images of past, similar concepts degrade. To circumvent this forgetting, we propose a new method, C-LoRA, composed of a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation in cross attention layers of the popular Stable Diffusion model. Furthermore, we use customization prompts which do not include the word of the customized object (i.e., "person" for a human face dataset) and are initialized as completely random embeddings. Importantly, our method induces only marginal additional parameter costs and requires no storage of user data for replay. We show that C-LoRA not only outperforms several baselines for our proposed setting of text-to-image continual customization, which we refer to as Continual Diffusion, but that we achieve a new state-of-the-art in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting for image classification. The high achieving performance of C-LoRA in two separate domains positions it as a compelling solution for a wide range of applications, and we believe it has significant potential for practical impact. 

**Title:** RECLIP: Resource-efficient CLIP by Training with Small Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06028

**Abstract:** We present RECLIP (Resource-efficient CLIP), a simple method that minimizes computational resource footprint for CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pretraining). Inspired by the notion of coarse-to-fine in computer vision, we leverage small images to learn from large-scale language supervision efficiently, and finetune the model with high-resolution data in the end. Since the complexity of the vision transformer heavily depends on input image size, our approach significantly reduces the training resource requirements both in theory and in practice. Using the same batch size and training epoch, RECLIP achieves highly competitive zero-shot classification and image text retrieval accuracy with 6 to 8$\times$ less computational resources and 7 to 9$\times$ fewer FLOPs than the baseline. Compared to the state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods, RECLIP demonstrates 5 to 59$\times$ training resource savings while maintaining highly competitive zero-shot classification and retrieval performance. We hope this work will pave the path for the broader research community to explore language supervised pretraining in more resource-friendly settings. 

**Title:** A Multi-Institutional Open-Source Benchmark Dataset for Breast Cancer  Clinical Decision Support using Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05623

**Abstract:** Recently, a new form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called synthetic correlated diffusion (CDI$^s$) imaging was introduced and showed considerable promise for clinical decision support for cancers such as prostate cancer when compared to current gold-standard MRI techniques. However, the efficacy for CDI$^s$ for other forms of cancers such as breast cancer has not been as well-explored nor have CDI$^s$ data been previously made publicly available. Motivated to advance efforts in the development of computer-aided clinical decision support for breast cancer using CDI$^s$, we introduce Cancer-Net BCa, a multi-institutional open-source benchmark dataset of volumetric CDI$^s$ imaging data of breast cancer patients. Cancer-Net BCa contains CDI$^s$ volumetric images from a pre-treatment cohort of 253 patients across ten institutions, along with detailed annotation metadata (the lesion type, genetic subtype, longest diameter on the MRI (MRLD), the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, and the post-treatment breast cancer pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy). We further examine the demographic and tumour diversity of the Cancer-Net BCa dataset to gain deeper insights into potential biases. Cancer-Net BCa is publicly available as a part of a global open-source initiative dedicated to accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid clinicians in the fight against cancer. 

**Title:** Universal Polarization Transformations: Spatial programming of  polarization scattering matrices using a deep learning-designed diffractive  polarization transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05724

**Abstract:** We demonstrate universal polarization transformers based on an engineered diffractive volume, which can synthesize a large set of arbitrarily-selected, complex-valued polarization scattering matrices between the polarization states at different positions within its input and output field-of-views (FOVs). This framework comprises 2D arrays of linear polarizers with diverse angles, which are positioned between isotropic diffractive layers, each containing tens of thousands of diffractive features with optimizable transmission coefficients. We demonstrate that, after its deep learning-based training, this diffractive polarization transformer could successfully implement N_i x N_o = 10,000 different spatially-encoded polarization scattering matrices with negligible error within a single diffractive volume, where N_i and N_o represent the number of pixels in the input and output FOVs, respectively. We experimentally validated this universal polarization transformation framework in the terahertz part of the spectrum by fabricating wire-grid polarizers and integrating them with 3D-printed diffractive layers to form a physical polarization transformer operating at 0.75 mm wavelength. Through this set-up, we demonstrated an all-optical polarization permutation operation of spatially-varying polarization fields, and simultaneously implemented distinct spatially-encoded polarization scattering matrices between the input and output FOVs of a compact diffractive processor that axially spans 200 wavelengths. This framework opens up new avenues for developing novel optical devices for universal polarization control, and may find various applications in, e.g., remote sensing, medical imaging, security, material inspection and machine vision.
