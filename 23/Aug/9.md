**Title:** GPT-4 Can't Reason  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03762  
**Abstract:** GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim, marking a very substantial improvement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAI's previously best model, which had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). However, despite the genuinely impressive improvement, there are good reasons to be highly skeptical of GPT-4's ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of reasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP community, as well as the way in which LLM reasoning performance is currently evaluated; introduces a small collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and performs a detailed qualitative evaluation of GPT-4's performance on those problems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that, despite its occasional flashes of analytical brilliance, GPT-4 at present is utterly incapable of reasoning.

**Title:** Enhancing image captioning with depth information using a  Transformer-based framework  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03767  
**Abstract:** Captioning images is a challenging scene-understanding task that connects computer vision and natural language processing. While image captioning models have been successful in producing excellent descriptions, the field has primarily focused on generating a single sentence for 2D images. This paper investigates whether integrating depth information with RGB images can enhance the captioning task and generate better descriptions. For this purpose, we propose a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework for generating a multi-sentence description of a 3D scene. The RGB image and its corresponding depth map are provided as inputs to our framework, which combines them to produce a better understanding of the input scene. Depth maps could be ground truth or estimated, which makes our framework widely applicable to any RGB captioning dataset. We explored different fusion approaches to fuse RGB and depth images. The experiments are performed on the NYU-v2 dataset and the Stanford image paragraph captioning dataset. During our work with the NYU-v2 dataset, we found inconsistent labeling that prevents the benefit of using depth information to enhance the captioning task. The results were even worse than using RGB images only. As a result, we propose a cleaned version of the NYU-v2 dataset that is more consistent and informative. Our results on both datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively benefits from depth information, whether it is ground truth or estimated, and generates better captions. Code, pre-trained models, and the cleaned version of the NYU-v2 dataset will be made publically available.

**Title:** GeoTransformer: Fast and Robust Point Cloud Registration with Geometric  Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03768  
**Abstract:** We study the problem of extracting accurate correspondences for point cloud registration. Recent keypoint-free methods have shown great potential through bypassing the detection of repeatable keypoints which is difficult to do especially in low-overlap scenarios. They seek correspondences over downsampled superpoints, which are then propagated to dense points. Superpoints are matched based on whether their neighboring patches overlap. Such sparse and loose matching requires contextual features capturing the geometric structure of the point clouds. We propose Geometric Transformer, or GeoTransformer for short, to learn geometric feature for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it invariant to rigid transformation and robust in low-overlap cases. The simplistic design attains surprisingly high matching accuracy such that no RANSAC is required in the estimation of alignment transformation, leading to $100$ times acceleration. Extensive experiments on rich benchmarks encompassing indoor, outdoor, synthetic, multiway and non-rigid demonstrate the efficacy of GeoTransformer. Notably, our method improves the inlier ratio by $18{\sim}31$ percentage points and the registration recall by over $7$ points on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/qinzheng93/GeoTransformer}.

**Title:** Improved Neural Radiance Fields Using Pseudo-depth and Fusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03772  
**Abstract:** Since the advent of Neural Radiance Fields, novel view synthesis has received tremendous attention. The existing approach for the generalization of radiance field reconstruction primarily constructs an encoding volume from nearby source images as additional inputs. However, these approaches cannot efficiently encode the geometric information of real scenes with various scale objects/structures. In this work, we propose constructing multi-scale encoding volumes and providing multi-scale geometry information to NeRF models. To make the constructed volumes as close as possible to the surfaces of objects in the scene and the rendered depth more accurate, we propose to perform depth prediction and radiance field reconstruction simultaneously. The predicted depth map will be used to supervise the rendered depth, narrow the depth range, and guide points sampling. Finally, the geometric information contained in point volume features may be inaccurate due to occlusion, lighting, etc. To this end, we propose enhancing the point volume feature from depth-guided neighbor feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both novel view synthesis and dense geometry modeling without per-scene optimization.

**Title:** Bio+Clinical BERT, BERT Base, and CNN Performance Comparison for  Predicting Drug-Review Satisfaction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03782  
**Abstract:** The objective of this study is to develop natural language processing (NLP) models that can analyze patients' drug reviews and accurately classify their satisfaction levels as positive, neutral, or negative. Such models would reduce the workload of healthcare professionals and provide greater insight into patients' quality of life, which is a critical indicator of treatment effectiveness. To achieve this, we implemented and evaluated several classification models, including a BERT base model, Bio+Clinical BERT, and a simpler CNN. Results indicate that the medical domain-specific Bio+Clinical BERT model significantly outperformed the general domain base BERT model, achieving macro f1 and recall score improvement of 11%, as shown in Table 2. Future research could explore how to capitalize on the specific strengths of each model. Bio+Clinical BERT excels in overall performance, particularly with medical jargon, while the simpler CNN demonstrates the ability to identify crucial words and accurately classify sentiment in texts with conflicting sentiments.

**Title:** Improving Requirements Completeness: Automated Assistance through Large  Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03784  
**Abstract:** Natural language (NL) is arguably the most prevalent medium for expressing systems and software requirements. Detecting incompleteness in NL requirements is a major challenge. One approach to identify incompleteness is to compare requirements with external sources. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs), an interesting question arises: Are LLMs useful external sources of knowledge for detecting potential incompleteness in NL requirements? This article explores this question by utilizing BERT. Specifically, we employ BERT's masked language model (MLM) to generate contextualized predictions for filling masked slots in requirements. To simulate incompleteness, we withhold content from the requirements and assess BERT's ability to predict terminology that is present in the withheld content but absent in the disclosed content. BERT can produce multiple predictions per mask. Our first contribution is determining the optimal number of predictions per mask, striking a balance between effectively identifying omissions in requirements and mitigating noise present in the predictions. Our second contribution involves designing a machine learning-based filter to post-process BERT's predictions and further reduce noise. We conduct an empirical evaluation using 40 requirements specifications from the PURE dataset. Our findings indicate that: (1) BERT's predictions effectively highlight terminology that is missing from requirements, (2) BERT outperforms simpler baselines in identifying relevant yet missing terminology, and (3) our filter significantly reduces noise in the predictions, enhancing BERT's effectiveness as a tool for completeness checking of requirements.

**Title:** ReCLIP: Refine Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training with Source Free  Domain Adaptation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03793  
**Abstract:** Large-scale Pre-Training Vision-Language Model such as CLIP has demonstrated outstanding performance in zero-shot classification, e.g. achieving 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without seeing any example, which leads to potential benefits to many tasks that have no labeled data. However, while applying CLIP to a downstream target domain, the presence of visual and text domain gaps and cross-modality misalignment can greatly impact the model performance. To address such challenges, we propose ReCLIP, the first source-free domain adaptation method for vision-language models, which does not require any source data or target labeled data. ReCLIP first learns a projection space to mitigate the misaligned visual-text embeddings and learns pseudo labels, and then deploys cross-modality self-training with the pseudo labels, to update visual and text encoders, refine labels and reduce domain gaps and misalignments iteratively. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate ReCLIP reduces the average error rate of CLIP from 30.17% to 25.06% on 22 image classification benchmarks.

**Title:** XFlow: Benchmarking Flow Behaviors over Graphs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03819  
**Abstract:** The occurrence of diffusion on a graph is a prevalent and significant phenomenon, as evidenced by the spread of rumors, influenza-like viruses, smart grid failures, and similar events. Comprehending the behaviors of flow is a formidable task, due to the intricate interplay between the distribution of seeds that initiate flow propagation, the propagation model, and the topology of the graph. The study of networks encompasses a diverse range of academic disciplines, including mathematics, physics, social science, and computer science. This interdisciplinary nature of network research is characterized by a high degree of specialization and compartmentalization, and the cooperation facilitated by them is inadequate. From a machine learning standpoint, there is a deficiency in a cohesive platform for assessing algorithms across various domains. One of the primary obstacles to current research in this field is the absence of a comprehensive curated benchmark suite to study the flow behaviors under network scenarios.

**Title:** Distributionally Robust Classification on a Data Budget  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03821  
**Abstract:** Real world uses of deep learning require predictable model behavior under distribution shifts. Models such as CLIP show emergent natural distributional robustness comparable to humans, but may require hundreds of millions of training samples. Can we train robust learners in a domain where data is limited? To rigorously address this question, we introduce JANuS (Joint Annotations and Names Set), a collection of four new training datasets with images, labels, and corresponding captions, and perform a series of carefully controlled investigations of factors contributing to robustness in image classification, then compare those results to findings derived from a large-scale meta-analysis. Using this approach, we show that standard ResNet-50 trained with the cross-entropy loss on 2.4 million image samples can attain comparable robustness to a CLIP ResNet-50 trained on 400 million samples. To our knowledge, this is the first result showing (near) state-of-the-art distributional robustness on limited data budgets. Our dataset is available at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/penfever/JANuS_dataset}, and the code used to reproduce our experiments can be found at \url{https://github.com/penfever/vlhub/}.

**Title:** "Do Anything Now": Characterizing and Evaluating In-The-Wild Jailbreak  Prompts on Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03825  
**Abstract:** The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.

**Title:** Recurrent Multi-scale Transformer for High-Resolution Salient Object  Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03826  
**Abstract:** Salient Object Detection (SOD) aims to identify and segment the most conspicuous objects in an image or video. As an important pre-processing step, it has many potential applications in multimedia and vision tasks. With the advance of imaging devices, SOD with high-resolution images is of great demand, recently. However, traditional SOD methods are largely limited to low-resolution images, making them difficult to adapt to the development of High-Resolution SOD (HRSOD). Although some HRSOD methods emerge, there are no large enough datasets for training and evaluating. Besides, current HRSOD methods generally produce incomplete object regions and irregular object boundaries. To address above issues, in this work, we first propose a new HRS10K dataset, which contains 10,500 high-quality annotated images at 2K-8K resolution. As far as we know, it is the largest dataset for the HRSOD task, which will significantly help future works in training and evaluating models. Furthermore, to improve the HRSOD performance, we propose a novel Recurrent Multi-scale Transformer (RMFormer), which recurrently utilizes shared Transformers and multi-scale refinement architectures. Thus, high-resolution saliency maps can be generated with the guidance of lower-resolution predictions. Extensive experiments on both high-resolution and low-resolution benchmarks show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. The source code and dataset are released at: https://github.com/DrowsyMon/RMFormer.

**Title:** Extracting detailed oncologic history and treatment plan from medical  oncology notes with large language models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03853  
**Abstract:** Both medical care and observational studies in oncology require a thorough understanding of a patient's disease progression and treatment history, often elaborately documented in clinical notes. Despite their vital role, no current oncology information representation and annotation schema fully encapsulates the diversity of information recorded within these notes. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited impressive performance on various medical natural language processing tasks, due to the current lack of comprehensively annotated oncology datasets, an extensive evaluation of LLMs in extracting and reasoning with the complex rhetoric in oncology notes remains understudied. We developed a detailed schema for annotating textual oncology information, encompassing patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, tests, treatments, and temporality. Using a corpus of 10 de-identified breast cancer progress notes at University of California, San Francisco, we applied this schema to assess the abilities of three recently-released LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and FLAN-UL2) to perform zero-shot extraction of detailed oncological history from two narrative sections of clinical progress notes. Our team annotated 2750 entities, 2874 modifiers, and 1623 relationships. The GPT-4 model exhibited overall best performance, with an average BLEU score of 0.69, an average ROUGE score of 0.72, and an average accuracy of 67% on complex tasks (expert manual evaluation). Notably, it was proficient in tumor characteristic and medication extraction, and demonstrated superior performance in inferring symptoms due to cancer and considerations of future medications. The analysis demonstrates that GPT-4 is potentially already usable to extract important facts from cancer progress notes needed for clinical research, complex population management, and documenting quality patient care.

**Title:** Trusting Language Models in Education  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03866  
**Abstract:** Language Models are being widely used in Education. Even though modern deep learning models achieve very good performance on question-answering tasks, sometimes they make errors. To avoid misleading students by showing wrong answers, it is important to calibrate the confidence - that is, the prediction probability - of these models. In our work, we propose to use an XGBoost on top of BERT to output the corrected probabilities, using features based on the attention mechanism. Our hypothesis is that the level of uncertainty contained in the flow of attention is related to the quality of the model's response itself.

**Title:** From Sky to the Ground: A Large-scale Benchmark and Simple Baseline  Towards Real Rain Removal  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03867  
**Abstract:** Learning-based image deraining methods have made great progress. However, the lack of large-scale high-quality paired training samples is the main bottleneck to hamper the real image deraining (RID). To address this dilemma and advance RID, we construct a Large-scale High-quality Paired real rain benchmark (LHP-Rain), including 3000 video sequences with 1 million high-resolution (1920*1080) frame pairs. The advantages of the proposed dataset over the existing ones are three-fold: rain with higher-diversity and larger-scale, image with higher-resolution and higher-quality ground-truth. Specifically, the real rains in LHP-Rain not only contain the classical rain streak/veiling/occlusion in the sky, but also the \textbf{splashing on the ground} overlooked by deraining community. Moreover, we propose a novel robust low-rank tensor recovery model to generate the GT with better separating the static background from the dynamic rain. In addition, we design a simple transformer-based single image deraining baseline, which simultaneously utilize the self-attention and cross-layer attention within the image and rain layer with discriminative feature representation. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed dataset and deraining method over state-of-the-art.

**Title:** Semantic Equivalence of e-Commerce Queries  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03869  
**Abstract:** Search query variation poses a challenge in e-commerce search, as equivalent search intents can be expressed through different queries with surface-level differences. This paper introduces a framework to recognize and leverage query equivalence to enhance searcher and business outcomes. The proposed approach addresses three key problems: mapping queries to vector representations of search intent, identifying nearest neighbor queries expressing equivalent or similar intent, and optimizing for user or business objectives. The framework utilizes both surface similarity and behavioral similarity to determine query equivalence. Surface similarity involves canonicalizing queries based on word inflection, word order, compounding, and noise words. Behavioral similarity leverages historical search behavior to generate vector representations of query intent. An offline process is used to train a sentence similarity model, while an online nearest neighbor approach supports processing of unseen queries. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming popular sentence transformer models and achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.85 for query similarity. The results highlight the potential of leveraging historical behavior data and training models to recognize and utilize query equivalence in e-commerce search, leading to improved user experiences and business outcomes. Further advancements and benchmark datasets are encouraged to facilitate the development of solutions for this critical problem in the e-commerce domain.

**Title:** Evaluating and Explaining Large Language Models for Code Using Syntactic  Structures  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03873  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are a family of high-parameter, transformer-based neural networks pre-trained on massive datasets of both natural and programming languages. These models are rapidly being employed in commercial AI-based developer tools, such as GitHub CoPilot. However, measuring and explaining their effectiveness on programming tasks is a challenging proposition, given their size and complexity. The methods for evaluating and explaining LLMs for code are inextricably linked. That is, in order to explain a model's predictions, they must be reliably mapped to fine-grained, understandable concepts. Once this mapping is achieved, new methods for detailed model evaluations are possible. However, most current explainability techniques and evaluation benchmarks focus on model robustness or individual task performance, as opposed to interpreting model predictions.

**Title:** A staggered-in-time and non-conforming-in-space numerical framework for  realistic cardiac electrophysiology outputs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03884  
**Abstract:** Computer-based simulations of non-invasive cardiac electrical outputs, such as electrocardiograms and body surface potential maps, usually entail severe computational costs due to the need of capturing fine-scale processes and to the complexity of the heart-torso morphology. In this work, we model cardiac electrical outputs by employing a coupled model consisting of a reaction-diffusion model - either the bidomain model or the most efficient pseudo-bidomain model - on the heart, and an elliptic model in the torso. We then solve the coupled problem with a segregated and staggered in-time numerical scheme, that allows for independent and infrequent solution in the torso region. To further reduce the computational load, main novelty of this work is in introduction of an interpolation method at the interface between the heart and torso domains, enabling the use of non-conforming meshes, and the numerical framework application to realistic cardiac and torso geometries. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed scheme is tested against the corresponding state-of-the-art bidomain-torso model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of torso spatial discretization and geometrical non-conformity on the model solution and the corresponding clinical outputs. The investigation of the interface interpolation method provides insights into the influence of torso spatial discretization and of the geometrical non-conformity on the simulation results and their clinical relevance.

**Title:** A Cross-Domain Evaluation of Approaches for Causal Knowledge Extraction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03891  
**Abstract:** Causal knowledge extraction is the task of extracting relevant causes and effects from text by detecting the causal relation. Although this task is important for language understanding and knowledge discovery, recent works in this domain have largely focused on binary classification of a text segment as causal or non-causal. In this regard, we perform a thorough analysis of three sequence tagging models for causal knowledge extraction and compare it with a span based approach to causality extraction. Our experiments show that embeddings from pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT) provide a significant performance boost on this task compared to previous state-of-the-art models with complex architectures. We observe that span based models perform better than simple sequence tagging models based on BERT across all 4 data sets from diverse domains with different types of cause-effect phrases.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03929  
**Abstract:** Methods: Through an innovative approach, we construct ontology-based knowledge graphs from authentic medical literature and AI-generated content. Our goal is to distinguish factual information from unverified data. We compiled two datasets: one from biomedical literature using a "human disease and symptoms" query, and another generated by ChatGPT, simulating articles. With these datasets (PubMed and ChatGPT), we curated 10 sets of 250 abstracts each, selected randomly with a specific seed. Our method focuses on utilizing disease ontology (DOID) and symptom ontology (SYMP) to build knowledge graphs, robust mathematical models that facilitate unbiased comparisons. By employing our fact-checking algorithms and network centrality metrics, we conducted GPT disease-symptoms link analysis to quantify the accuracy of factual knowledge amid noise, hypotheses, and significant findings.

**Title:** The Prospect of Enhancing Large-Scale Heterogeneous Federated Learning  with Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03945  
**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy concerns by enabling collaborative training of AI models across distributed data owners. Wide adoption of FL faces the fundamental challenges of data heterogeneity and the large scale of data owners involved. In this paper, we investigate the prospect of Transformer-based FL models for achieving generalization and personalization in this setting. We conduct extensive comparative experiments involving FL with Transformers, ResNet, and personalized ResNet-based FL approaches under various scenarios. These experiments consider varying numbers of data owners to demonstrate Transformers' advantages over deep neural networks in large-scale heterogeneous FL tasks. In addition, we analyze the superior performance of Transformers by comparing the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) representation similarity across different layers and FL models to gain insight into the reasons behind their promising capabilities.

**Title:** PMU measurements based short-term voltage stability assessment of power  systems via deep transfer learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03953  
**Abstract:** Deep learning has emerged as an effective solution for addressing the challenges of short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) in power systems. However, existing deep learning-based STVSA approaches face limitations in adapting to topological changes, sample labeling, and handling small datasets. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements-based STVSA method by using deep transfer learning. The method leverages the real-time dynamic information captured by PMUs to create an initial dataset. It employs temporal ensembling for sample labeling and utilizes least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGAN) for data augmentation, enabling effective deep learning on small-scale datasets. Additionally, the method enhances adaptability to topological changes by exploring connections between different faults. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed method improves model evaluation accuracy by approximately 20% through transfer learning, exhibiting strong adaptability to topological changes. Leveraging the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer model, this approach offers significant advantages over shallow learning methods and other deep learning-based approaches.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03968  
**Abstract:** Medical image classification poses unique challenges due to the long-tailed distribution of diseases, the co-occurrence of diagnostic findings, and the multiple views available for each study or patient. This paper introduces our solution to the ICCV CVAMD 2023 Shared Task on CXR-LT: Multi-Label Long-Tailed Classification on Chest X-Rays.

**Title:** Few-shot medical image classification with simple shape and texture text  descriptors using vision-language models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04005  
**Abstract:** In this work, we investigate the usefulness of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models for binary few-shot classification of medical images. We utilize the GPT-4 model to generate text descriptors that encapsulate the shape and texture characteristics of objects in medical images. Subsequently, these GPT-4 generated descriptors, alongside VLMs pre-trained on natural images, are employed to classify chest X-rays and breast ultrasound images. Our results indicate that few-shot classification of medical images using VLMs and GPT-4 generated descriptors is a viable approach. However, accurate classification requires to exclude certain descriptors from the calculations of the classification scores. Moreover, we assess the ability of VLMs to evaluate shape features in breast mass ultrasound images. We further investigate the degree of variability among the sets of text descriptors produced by GPT-4. Our work provides several important insights about the application of VLMs for medical image analysis.

**Title:** Hierarchical Visual Primitive Experts for Compositional Zero-Shot  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04016  
**Abstract:** Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen compositions with prior knowledge of known primitives (attribute and object). Previous works for CZSL often suffer from grasping the contextuality between attribute and object, as well as the discriminability of visual features, and the long-tailed distribution of real-world compositional data. We propose a simple and scalable framework called Composition Transformer (CoT) to address these issues. CoT employs object and attribute experts in distinctive manners to generate representative embeddings, using the visual network hierarchically. The object expert extracts representative object embeddings from the final layer in a bottom-up manner, while the attribute expert makes attribute embeddings in a top-down manner with a proposed object-guided attention module that models contextuality explicitly. To remedy biased prediction caused by imbalanced data distribution, we develop a simple minority attribute augmentation (MAA) that synthesizes virtual samples by mixing two images and oversampling minority attribute classes. Our method achieves SoTA performance on several benchmarks, including MIT-States, C-GQA, and VAW-CZSL. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of CoT in improving visual discrimination and addressing the model bias from the imbalanced data distribution. The code is available at https://github.com/HanjaeKim98/CoT.

**Title:** Synthetic Augmentation with Large-scale Unconditional Pre-training  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04020  
**Abstract:** Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original labels.

Existing evaluation methods suffer from following shortcomings: (1) constrained evaluation abilities, (2) vulnerable benchmarks, (3) unobjective metrics. We suggest that task-based evaluation, where LLM agents complete tasks in a simulated environment, is a one-for-all solution to solve above problems. We present AgentSims, an easy-to-use infrastructure for researchers from all disciplines to test the specific capacities they are interested in. Researchers can build their evaluation tasks by adding agents and buildings on an interactive GUI or deploy and test new support mechanisms, i.e. memory, planning and tool-use systems, by a few lines of codes.

**Title:** Adapting Foundation Models for Information Synthesis of Wireless  Communication Specifications  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04033  
**Abstract:** Existing approaches to understanding, developing and researching modern wireless communication technologies involves time-intensive and arduous process of sifting through numerous webpages and technical specification documents, gathering the required information and synthesizing it. This paper presents NextGen Communications Copilot, a conversational artificial intelligence tool for information synthesis of wireless communication specifications. The system builds on top of recent advancements in foundation models and consists of three key additional components: a domain-specific database, a context extractor, and a feedback mechanism. The system appends user queries with concise and query-dependent contextual information extracted from a database of wireless technical specifications and incorporates tools for expert feedback and data contributions. On evaluation using a benchmark dataset of queries and reference responses created by subject matter experts, the system demonstrated more relevant and accurate answers with an average BLEU score and BERTScore F1-measure of 0.37 and 0.79 respectively compared to the corresponding values of 0.07 and 0.59 achieved by state-of-the-art tools like ChatGPT.

**Title:** SODFormer: Streaming Object Detection with Transformer Using Events and  Frames  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04047  
**Abstract:** DAVIS camera, streaming two complementary sensing modalities of asynchronous events and frames, has gradually been used to address major object detection challenges (e.g., fast motion blur and low-light). However, how to effectively leverage rich temporal cues and fuse two heterogeneous visual streams remains a challenging endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose a novel streaming object detector with Transformer, namely SODFormer, which first integrates events and frames to continuously detect objects in an asynchronous manner. Technically, we first build a large-scale multimodal neuromorphic object detection dataset (i.e., PKU-DAVIS-SOD) over 1080.1k manual labels. Then, we design a spatiotemporal Transformer architecture to detect objects via an end-to-end sequence prediction problem, where the novel temporal Transformer module leverages rich temporal cues from two visual streams to improve the detection performance. Finally, an asynchronous attention-based fusion module is proposed to integrate two heterogeneous sensing modalities and take complementary advantages from each end, which can be queried at any time to locate objects and break through the limited output frequency from synchronized frame-based fusion strategies. The results show that the proposed SODFormer outperforms four state-of-the-art methods and our eight baselines by a significant margin. We also show that our unifying framework works well even in cases where the conventional frame-based camera fails, e.g., high-speed motion and low-light conditions. Our dataset and code can be available at https://github.com/dianzl/SODFormer.

**Title:** The Five-Dollar Model: Generating Game Maps and Sprites from Sentence  Embeddings  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04052  
**Abstract:** The five-dollar model is a lightweight text-to-image generative architecture that generates low dimensional images from an encoded text prompt. This model can successfully generate accurate and aesthetically pleasing content in low dimensional domains, with limited amounts of training data. Despite the small size of both the model and datasets, the generated images are still able to maintain the encoded semantic meaning of the textual prompt. We apply this model to three small datasets: pixel art video game maps, video game sprite images, and down-scaled emoji images and apply novel augmentation strategies to improve the performance of our model on these limited datasets. We evaluate our models performance using cosine similarity score between text-image pairs generated by the CLIP VIT-B/32 model.

**Title:** Online Distillation-enhanced Multi-modal Transformer for Sequential  Recommendation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04067  
**Abstract:** Multi-modal recommendation systems, which integrate diverse types of information, have gained widespread attention in recent years. However, compared to traditional collaborative filtering-based multi-modal recommendation systems, research on multi-modal sequential recommendation is still in its nascent stages. Unlike traditional sequential recommendation models that solely rely on item identifier (ID) information and focus on network structure design, multi-modal recommendation models need to emphasize item representation learning and the fusion of heterogeneous data sources. This paper investigates the impact of item representation learning on downstream recommendation tasks and examines the disparities in information fusion at different stages. Empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the need to design a framework suitable for collaborative learning and fusion of diverse information. Based on this, we propose a new model-agnostic framework for multi-modal sequential recommendation tasks, called Online Distillation-enhanced Multi-modal Transformer (ODMT), to enhance feature interaction and mutual learning among multi-source input (ID, text, and image), while avoiding conflicts among different features during training, thereby improving recommendation accuracy. To be specific, we first introduce an ID-aware Multi-modal Transformer module in the item representation learning stage to facilitate information interaction among different features. Secondly, we employ an online distillation training strategy in the prediction optimization stage to make multi-source data learn from each other and improve prediction robustness. Experimental results on a video content recommendation dataset and three e-commerce recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two modules, which is approximately 10% improvement in performance compared to baseline models.

**Title:** Boundary-preserving Lamperti-splitting scheme for some Stochastic  Differential Equations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04075  
**Abstract:** We propose and analyse an explicit boundary-preserving scheme for the strong approximations of some SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients whose state-space is bounded. The scheme consists of a Lamperti transform followed by a Lie--Trotter splitting. We prove $L^{p}(\Omega)$-convergence of order $1$, for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$, of the scheme and exploit the Lamperti transform to confine the numerical approximations to the state-space of the considered SDE. We provide numerical experiments that confirm the theoretical results and compare the proposed Lamperti-splitting scheme to other numerical schemes for SDEs.

**Title:** I-WAS: a Data Augmentation Method with GPT-2 for Simile Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04109  
**Abstract:** Simile detection is a valuable task for many natural language processing (NLP)-based applications, particularly in the field of literature. However, existing research on simile detection often relies on corpora that are limited in size and do not adequately represent the full range of simile forms. To address this issue, we propose a simile data augmentation method based on \textbf{W}ord replacement And Sentence completion using the GPT-2 language model. Our iterative process called I-WAS, is designed to improve the quality of the augmented sentences. To better evaluate the performance of our method in real-world applications, we have compiled a corpus containing a more diverse set of simile forms for experimentation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed data augmentation method for simile detection.

**Title:** Multimodal Color Recommendation in Vector Graphic Documents  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04118  
**Abstract:** Color selection plays a critical role in graphic document design and requires sufficient consideration of various contexts. However, recommending appropriate colors which harmonize with the other colors and textual contexts in documents is a challenging task, even for experienced designers. In this study, we propose a multimodal masked color model that integrates both color and textual contexts to provide text-aware color recommendation for graphic documents. Our proposed model comprises self-attention networks to capture the relationships between colors in multiple palettes, and cross-attention networks that incorporate both color and CLIP-based text representations. Our proposed method primarily focuses on color palette completion, which recommends colors based on the given colors and text. Additionally, it is applicable for another color recommendation task, full palette generation, which generates a complete color palette corresponding to the given text. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses previous color palette completion methods on accuracy, color distribution, and user experience, as well as full palette generation methods concerning color diversity and similarity to the ground truth palettes.

**Title:** Large Language Model Prompt Chaining for Long Legal Document  Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04138  
**Abstract:** Prompting is used to guide or steer a language model in generating an appropriate response that is consistent with the desired outcome. Chaining is a strategy used to decompose complex tasks into smaller, manageable components. In this study, we utilize prompt chaining for extensive legal document classification tasks, which present difficulties due to their intricate domain-specific language and considerable length. Our approach begins with the creation of a concise summary of the original document, followed by a semantic search for related exemplar texts and their corresponding annotations from a training corpus. Finally, we prompt for a label - based on the task - to assign, by leveraging the in-context learning from the few-shot prompt. We demonstrate that through prompt chaining, we can not only enhance the performance over zero-shot, but also surpass the micro-F1 score achieved by larger models, such as ChatGPT zero-shot, using smaller models.

**Title:** EPCFormer: Expression Prompt Collaboration Transformer for Universal  Referring Video Object Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04162  
**Abstract:** Audio-guided Video Object Segmentation (A-VOS) and Referring Video Object Segmentation (R-VOS) are two highly-related tasks, which both aim to segment specific objects from video sequences according to user-provided expression prompts. However, due to the challenges in modeling representations for different modalities, contemporary methods struggle to strike a balance between interaction flexibility and high-precision localization and segmentation. In this paper, we address this problem from two perspectives: the alignment representation of audio and text and the deep interaction among audio, text, and visual features. First, we propose a universal architecture, the Expression Prompt Collaboration Transformer, herein EPCFormer. Next, we propose an Expression Alignment (EA) mechanism for audio and text expressions. By introducing contrastive learning for audio and text expressions, the proposed EPCFormer realizes comprehension of the semantic equivalence between audio and text expressions denoting the same objects. Then, to facilitate deep interactions among audio, text, and video features, we introduce an Expression-Visual Attention (EVA) mechanism. The knowledge of video object segmentation in terms of the expression prompts can seamlessly transfer between the two tasks by deeply exploring complementary cues between text and audio. Experiments on well-recognized benchmarks demonstrate that our universal EPCFormer attains state-of-the-art results on both tasks. The source code of EPCFormer will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lab206/EPCFormer.

**Title:** Assistive Chatbots for healthcare: a succinct review  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04178  
**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting healthcare services has never been more necessitated than by the recent global pandemic. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in AI-enabled Chatbots in healthcare proposed during the last 10 years (2013-2023). The focus on AI-enabled technology is because of its potential for enhancing the quality of human-machine interaction via Chatbots, reducing dependence on human-human interaction and saving man-hours. Our review indicates that there are a handful of (commercial) Chatbots that are being used for patient support, while there are others (non-commercial) that are in the clinical trial phases. However, there is a lack of trust on this technology regarding patient safety and data protection, as well as a lack of wider awareness on its benefits among the healthcare workers and professionals. Also, patients have expressed dissatisfaction with Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills of the Chatbots in comparison to humans. Notwithstanding the recent introduction of ChatGPT that has raised the bar for the NLP technology, this Chatbot cannot be trusted with patient safety and medical ethics without thorough and rigorous checks to serve in the `narrow' domain of assistive healthcare. Our review suggests that to enable deployment and integration of AI-enabled Chatbots in public health services, the need of the hour is: to build technology that is simple and safe to use; to build confidence on the technology among: (a) the medical community by focussed training and development; (b) the patients and wider community through outreach.

**Title:** Exploring Transformers for Open-world Instance Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04206  
**Abstract:** Open-world instance segmentation is a rising task, which aims to segment all objects in the image by learning from a limited number of base-category objects. This task is challenging, as the number of unseen categories could be hundreds of times larger than that of seen categories. Recently, the DETR-like models have been extensively studied in the closed world while stay unexplored in the open world. In this paper, we utilize the Transformer for open-world instance segmentation and present SWORD. Firstly, we introduce to attach the stop-gradient operation before classification head and further add IoU heads for discovering novel objects. We demonstrate that a simple stop-gradient operation not only prevents the novel objects from being suppressed as background, but also allows the network to enjoy the merit of heuristic label assignment. Secondly, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to enlarge the representations between objects and background. Specifically, we maintain a universal object queue to obtain the object center, and dynamically select positive and negative samples from the object queries for contrastive learning. While the previous works only focus on pursuing average recall and neglect average precision, we show the prominence of SWORD by giving consideration to both criteria. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in various open-world cross-category and cross-dataset generalizations. Particularly, in VOC to non-VOC setup, our method sets new state-of-the-art results of 40.0% on ARb100 and 34.9% on ARm100. For COCO to UVO generalization, SWORD significantly outperforms the previous best open-world model by 5.9% on APm and 8.1% on ARm100.

**Title:** Auditory Attention Decoding with Task-Related Multi-View Contrastive  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04244  
**Abstract:** The human brain can easily focus on one speaker and suppress others in scenarios such as a cocktail party. Recently, researchers found that auditory attention can be decoded from the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, most existing deep learning methods are difficult to use prior knowledge of different views (that is attended speech and EEG are task-related views) and extract an unsatisfactory representation. Inspired by Broadbent's filter model, we decode auditory attention in a multi-view paradigm and extract the most relevant and important information utilizing the missing view. Specifically, we propose an auditory attention decoding (AAD) method based on multi-view VAE with task-related multi-view contrastive (TMC) learning. Employing TMC learning in multi-view VAE can utilize the missing view to accumulate prior knowledge of different views into the fusion of representation, and extract the approximate task-related representation. We examine our method on two popular AAD datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of our method by comparing it to the state-of-the-art method.

**Title:** MindDiffuser: Controlled Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity  with Semantic and Structural Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04249  
**Abstract:** Reconstructing visual stimuli from brain recordings has been a meaningful and challenging task. Especially, the achievement of precise and controllable image reconstruction bears great significance in propelling the progress and utilization of brain-computer interfaces. Despite the advancements in complex image reconstruction techniques, the challenge persists in achieving a cohesive alignment of both semantic (concepts and objects) and structure (position, orientation, and size) with the image stimuli. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a two-stage image reconstruction model called MindDiffuser. In Stage 1, the VQ-VAE latent representations and the CLIP text embeddings decoded from fMRI are put into Stable Diffusion, which yields a preliminary image that contains semantic information. In Stage 2, we utilize the CLIP visual feature decoded from fMRI as supervisory information, and continually adjust the two feature vectors decoded in Stage 1 through backpropagation to align the structural information. The results of both qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that our model has surpassed the current state-of-the-art models on Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD). The subsequent experimental findings corroborate the neurobiological plausibility of the model, as evidenced by the interpretability of the multimodal feature employed, which align with the corresponding brain responses.

**Title:** MCDAN: a Multi-scale Context-enhanced Dynamic Attention Network for  Diffusion Prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04266  
**Abstract:** Information diffusion prediction aims at predicting the target users in the information diffusion path on social networks. Prior works mainly focus on the observed structure or sequence of cascades, trying to predict to whom this cascade will be infected passively. In this study, we argue that user intent understanding is also a key part of information diffusion prediction. We thereby propose a novel Multi-scale Context-enhanced Dynamic Attention Network (MCDAN) to predict which user will most likely join the observed current cascades. Specifically, to consider the global interactive relationship among users, we take full advantage of user friendships and global cascading relationships, which are extracted from the social network and historical cascades, respectively. To refine the model's ability to understand the user's preference for the current cascade, we propose a multi-scale sequential hypergraph attention module to capture the dynamic preference of users at different time scales. Moreover, we design a contextual attention enhancement module to strengthen the interaction of user representations within the current cascade. Finally, to engage the user's own susceptibility, we construct a susceptibility label for each user based on user susceptibility analysis and use the rank of this label for auxiliary prediction. We conduct experiments over four widely used datasets and show that MCDAN significantly overperforms the state-of-the-art models. The average improvements are up to 10.61% in terms of Hits@100 and 9.71% in terms of MAP@100, respectively.

**Title:** Vision-Based Autonomous Navigation for Unmanned Surface Vessel in  Extreme Marine Conditions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04283  
**Abstract:** Visual perception is an important component for autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vessels (USV), particularly for the tasks related to autonomous inspection and tracking. These tasks involve vision-based navigation techniques to identify the target for navigation. Reduced visibility under extreme weather conditions in marine environments makes it difficult for vision-based approaches to work properly. To overcome these issues, this paper presents an autonomous vision-based navigation framework for tracking target objects in extreme marine conditions. The proposed framework consists of an integrated perception pipeline that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to remove noise and highlight the object features before passing them to the object detector (i.e., YOLOv5). The detected visual features are then used by the USV to track the target. The proposed framework has been thoroughly tested in simulation under extremely reduced visibility due to sandstorms and fog. The results are compared with state-of-the-art de-hazing methods across the benchmarked MBZIRC simulation dataset, on which the proposed scheme has outperformed the existing methods across various metrics.

**Title:** Cloth2Tex: A Customized Cloth Texture Generation Pipeline for 3D Virtual  Try-On  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04288  
**Abstract:** Fabricating and designing 3D garments has become extremely demanding with the increasing need for synthesizing realistic dressed persons for a variety of applications, e.g. 3D virtual try-on, digitalization of 2D clothes into 3D apparel, and cloth animation. It thus necessitates a simple and straightforward pipeline to obtain high-quality texture from simple input, such as 2D reference images. Since traditional warping-based texture generation methods require a significant number of control points to be manually selected for each type of garment, which can be a time-consuming and tedious process. We propose a novel method, called Cloth2Tex, which eliminates the human burden in this process. Cloth2Tex is a self-supervised method that generates texture maps with reasonable layout and structural consistency. Another key feature of Cloth2Tex is that it can be used to support high-fidelity texture inpainting. This is done by combining Cloth2Tex with a prevailing latent diffusion model. We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate that Cloth2Tex can generate high-quality texture maps and achieve the best visual effects in comparison to other methods.

**Title:** All-pairs Consistency Learning for Weakly Supervised Semantic  Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04321  
**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a new transformer-based regularization to better localize objects for Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). In image-level WSSS, Class Activation Map (CAM) is adopted to generate object localization as pseudo segmentation labels. To address the partial activation issue of the CAMs, consistency regularization is employed to maintain activation intensity invariance across various image augmentations. However, such methods ignore pair-wise relations among regions within each CAM, which capture context and should also be invariant across image views. To this end, we propose a new all-pairs consistency regularization (ACR). Given a pair of augmented views, our approach regularizes the activation intensities between a pair of augmented views, while also ensuring that the affinity across regions within each view remains consistent. We adopt vision transformers as the self-attention mechanism naturally embeds pair-wise affinity. This enables us to simply regularize the distance between the attention matrices of augmented image pairs. Additionally, we introduce a novel class-wise localization method that leverages the gradients of the class token. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing WSSS methods using transformers without modifying the architectures. We evaluate our method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Our method produces noticeably better class localization maps (67.3% mIoU on PASCAL VOC train), resulting in superior WSSS performances.

**Title:** Domain Adaptive Person Search via GAN-based Scene Synthesis for  Cross-scene Videos  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04322  
**Abstract:** Person search has recently been a challenging task in the computer vision domain, which aims to search specific pedestrians from real cameras.Nevertheless, most surveillance videos comprise only a handful of images of each pedestrian, which often feature identical backgrounds and clothing. Hence, it is difficult to learn more discriminative features for person search in real scenes. To tackle this challenge, we draw on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to synthesize data from surveillance videos. GAN has thrived in computer vision problems because it produces high-quality images efficiently. We merely alter the popular Fast R-CNN model, which is capable of processing videos and yielding accurate detection outcomes. In order to appropriately relieve the pressure brought by the two-stage model, we design an Assisted-Identity Query Module (AIDQ) to provide positive images for the behind part. Besides, the proposed novel GAN-based Scene Synthesis model that can synthesize high-quality cross-id person images for person search tasks. In order to facilitate the feature learning of the GAN-based Scene Synthesis model, we adopt an online learning strategy that collaboratively learns the synthesized images and original images. Extensive experiments on two widely used person search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, have shown that our method has achieved great performance, and the extensive ablation study further justifies our GAN-synthetic data can effectively increase the variability of the datasets and be more realistic.

**Title:** Unifying Two-Stream Encoders with Transformers for Cross-Modal Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04343  
**Abstract:** Most existing cross-modal retrieval methods employ two-stream encoders with different architectures for images and texts, \textit{e.g.}, CNN for images and RNN/Transformer for texts. Such discrepancy in architectures may induce different semantic distribution spaces and limit the interactions between images and texts, and further result in inferior alignment between images and texts. To fill this research gap, inspired by recent advances of Transformers in vision tasks, we propose to unify the encoder architectures with Transformers for both modalities. Specifically, we design a cross-modal retrieval framework purely based on two-stream Transformers, dubbed \textbf{Hierarchical Alignment Transformers (HAT)}, which consists of an image Transformer, a text Transformer, and a hierarchical alignment module. With such identical architectures, the encoders could produce representations with more similar characteristics for images and texts, and make the interactions and alignments between them much easier. Besides, to leverage the rich semantics, we devise a hierarchical alignment scheme to explore multi-level correspondences of different layers between images and texts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HAT, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Experimental results demonstrate that HAT outperforms SOTA baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on two key tasks, \textit{i.e.}, image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, HAT achieves 7.6\% and 16.7\% relative score improvement of Recall@1 on MSCOCO, and 4.4\% and 11.6\% on Flickr30k respectively. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/LuminosityX/HAT}.

**Title:** 3D-VisTA: Pre-trained Transformer for 3D Vision and Text Alignment  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04352  
**Abstract:** 3D vision-language grounding (3D-VL) is an emerging field that aims to connect the 3D physical world with natural language, which is crucial for achieving embodied intelligence. Current 3D-VL models rely heavily on sophisticated modules, auxiliary losses, and optimization tricks, which calls for a simple and unified model. In this paper, we propose 3D-VisTA, a pre-trained Transformer for 3D Vision and Text Alignment that can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks. 3D-VisTA simply utilizes self-attention layers for both single-modal modeling and multi-modal fusion without any sophisticated task-specific design. To further enhance its performance on 3D-VL tasks, we construct ScanScribe, the first large-scale 3D scene-text pairs dataset for 3D-VL pre-training. ScanScribe contains 2,995 RGB-D scans for 1,185 unique indoor scenes originating from ScanNet and 3R-Scan datasets, along with paired 278K scene descriptions generated from existing 3D-VL tasks, templates, and GPT-3. 3D-VisTA is pre-trained on ScanScribe via masked language/object modeling and scene-text matching. It achieves state-of-the-art results on various 3D-VL tasks, ranging from visual grounding and dense captioning to question answering and situated reasoning. Moreover, 3D-VisTA demonstrates superior data efficiency, obtaining strong performance even with limited annotations during downstream task fine-tuning.

**Title:** SSTFormer: Bridging Spiking Neural Network and Memory Support  Transformer for Frame-Event based Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04369  
**Abstract:** Event camera-based pattern recognition is a newly arising research topic in recent years. Current researchers usually transform the event streams into images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based classification. Although good performance can be achieved on simple event recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the following two issues. Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture information well. Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition. However, seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects. In this paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed method contains four main modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding, spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head. Due to the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102 frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. Extensive experiments on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We hope this work will boost the development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams. Both our dataset and source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/SSTFormer.

**Title:** Learning Evaluation Models from Large Language Models for Sequence  Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04386  
**Abstract:** Large language models achieve state-of-the-art performance on sequence generation evaluation, but typically have a large number of parameters. This is a computational challenge as presented by applying their evaluation capability at scale. To overcome the challenge, in this paper, we propose \textbf{ECT}, an \textbf{e}valuation \textbf{c}apability \textbf{t}ransfer method, to transfer the evaluation capability from LLMs to relatively lightweight language models. Based on the proposed ECT, we learn various evaluation models from ChatGPT, and employ them as reward models to improve sequence generation models via reinforcement learning and reranking approaches. Experimental results on machine translation, text style transfer, and summarization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ECT. Notably, applying the learned evaluation models to sequence generation models results in better generated sequences as evaluated by commonly used metrics and ChatGPT.

**Title:** LEFormer: A Hybrid CNN-Transformer Architecture for Accurate Lake  Extraction from Remote Sensing Imagery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04397  
**Abstract:** Lake extraction from remote sensing imagery is challenging due to the complex shapes of lakes and the presence of noise. Existing methods suffer from blurred segmentation boundaries and poor foreground modeling. In this paper, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, called LEFormer, for accurate lake extraction. LEFormer contains four main modules: CNN encoder, Transformer encoder, cross-encoder fusion, and lightweight decoder. The CNN encoder recovers local spatial information and improves fine-scale details. Simultaneously, the Transformer encoder captures long-range dependencies between sequences of any length, allowing them to obtain global features and context information better. Finally, a lightweight decoder is employed for mask prediction. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of LEFormer on two datasets, the Surface Water (SW) and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Lake (QTPL). Experimental results show that LEFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and efficiency on these two datasets, outperforming existing methods. Specifically, LEFormer achieves 90.86% and 97.42% mIoU on the SW and QTPL datasets with a parameter count of 3.61M, respectively, while being 20x minor than the previous SOTA method.

We evaluate the models using automatic MT metrics and show that translation between similar languages benefits from character-level input segmentation, while for less related languages, character-level vanilla Transformer-base often lags behind subword-level segmentation. We confirm previous findings that it is possible to close the gap by finetuning the already trained subword-level models to character-level.

**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive performance in vision and graphics tasks, such as novel view synthesis and immersive reality. However, the shape-radiance ambiguity of radiance fields remains a challenge, especially in the sparse viewpoints setting. Recent work resorts to integrating depth priors into outdoor NeRF training to alleviate the issue. However, the criteria for selecting depth priors and the relative merits of different priors have not been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the relative merits of selecting different approaches to use the depth priors is also an unexplored problem. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study and evaluation of employing depth priors to outdoor neural radiance fields, covering common depth sensing technologies and most application ways. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments with two representative NeRF methods equipped with four commonly-used depth priors and different depth usages on two widely used outdoor datasets. Our experimental results reveal several interesting findings that can potentially benefit practitioners and researchers in training their NeRF models with depth priors.

**Title:** Legal Summarisation through LLMs: The PRODIGIT Project  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04416  
**Abstract:** We present some initial results of a large-scale Italian project called PRODIGIT which aims to support tax judges and lawyers through digital technology, focusing on AI. We have focused on generation of summaries of judicial decisions and on the extraction of related information, such as the identification of legal issues and decision-making criteria, and the specification of keywords. To this end, we have deployed and evaluated different tools and approaches to extractive and abstractive summarisation. We have applied LLMs, and particularly on GPT4, which has enabled us to obtain results that proved satisfactory, according to an evaluation by expert tax judges and lawyers. On this basis, a prototype application is being built which will be made publicly available.

**Title:** DiffCR: A Fast Conditional Diffusion Framework for Cloud Removal from  Optical Satellite Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04417  
**Abstract:** Optical satellite images are a critical data source; however, cloud cover often compromises their quality, hindering image applications and analysis. Consequently, effectively removing clouds from optical satellite images has emerged as a prominent research direction. While recent advancements in cloud removal primarily rely on generative adversarial networks, which may yield suboptimal image quality, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse image-generation tasks, showcasing their potential in addressing this challenge. This paper presents a novel framework called DiffCR, which leverages conditional guided diffusion with deep convolutional networks for high-performance cloud removal for optical satellite imagery. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled encoder for conditional image feature extraction, providing a robust color representation to ensure the close similarity of appearance information between the conditional input and the synthesized output. Moreover, we propose a novel and efficient time and condition fusion block within the cloud removal model to accurately simulate the correspondence between the appearance in the conditional image and the target image at a low computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations on two commonly used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiffCR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on all metrics, with parameter and computational complexities amounting to only 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively, of those previous best methods. The source code, pre-trained models, and all the experimental results will be publicly available at https://github.com/XavierJiezou/DiffCR upon the paper's acceptance of this work.

**Title:** A Deep-Learning Method Using Auto-encoder and Generative Adversarial  Network for Anomaly Detection on Ancient Stone Stele Surfaces  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04426  
**Abstract:** Accurate detection of natural deterioration and man-made damage on the surfaces of ancient stele in the first instance is essential for their preventive conservation. Existing methods for cultural heritage preservation are not able to achieve this goal perfectly due to the difficulty of balancing accuracy, efficiency, timeliness, and cost. This paper presents a deep-learning method to automatically detect above mentioned emergencies on ancient stone stele in real time, employing autoencoder (AE) and generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing methods by requiring no extensive anomaly samples while enabling comprehensive detection of unpredictable anomalies. the method includes stages of monitoring, data acquisition, pre-processing, model structuring, and post-processing. Taking the Longmen Grottoes' stone steles as a case study, an unsupervised learning model based on AE and GAN architectures is proposed and validated with a reconstruction accuracy of 99.74\%. The method's evaluation revealed the proficient detection of seven artificially designed anomalies and demonstrated precision and reliability without false alarms. This research provides novel ideas and possibilities for the application of deep learning in the field of cultural heritage.

**Title:** High-Resolution Cranial Defect Reconstruction by Iterative,  Low-Resolution, Point Cloud Completion Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03813  
**Abstract:** Each year thousands of people suffer from various types of cranial injuries and require personalized implants whose manual design is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, an automatic, dedicated system to increase the availability of personalized cranial reconstruction is highly desirable. The problem of the automatic cranial defect reconstruction can be formulated as the shape completion task and solved using dedicated deep networks. Currently, the most common approach is to use the volumetric representation and apply deep networks dedicated to image segmentation. However, this approach has several limitations and does not scale well into high-resolution volumes, nor takes into account the data sparsity. In our work, we reformulate the problem into a point cloud completion task. We propose an iterative, transformer-based method to reconstruct the cranial defect at any resolution while also being fast and resource-efficient during training and inference. We compare the proposed methods to the state-of-the-art volumetric approaches and show superior performance in terms of GPU memory consumption while maintaining high-quality of the reconstructed defects.

**Title:** Target Speech Extraction with Conditional Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03987  
**Abstract:** Diffusion model-based speech enhancement has received increased attention since it can generate very natural enhanced signals and generalizes well to unseen conditions. Diffusion models have been explored for several sub-tasks of speech enhancement, such as speech denoising, dereverberation, and source separation. In this paper, we investigate their use for target speech extraction (TSE), which consists of estimating the clean speech signal of a target speaker in a mixture of multi-talkers. TSE is realized by conditioning the extraction process on a clue identifying the target speaker. We show we can realize TSE using a conditional diffusion model conditioned on the clue. Besides, we introduce ensemble inference to reduce potential extraction errors caused by the diffusion process. In experiments on Libri2mix corpus, we show that the proposed diffusion model-based TSE combined with ensemble inference outperforms a comparable TSE system trained discriminatively.

**Title:** SDLFormer: A Sparse and Dense Locality-enhanced Transformer for  Accelerated MR Image Reconstruction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04262  
**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as viable alternatives to convolutional neural networks owing to their ability to learn non-local region relationships in the spatial domain. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer enables transformers to capture long-range dependencies in the images, which might be desirable for accelerated MRI image reconstruction as the effect of undersampling is non-local in the image domain. Despite its computational efficiency, the window-based transformers suffer from restricted receptive fields as the dependencies are limited to within the scope of the image windows. We propose a window-based transformer network that integrates dilated attention mechanism and convolution for accelerated MRI image reconstruction. The proposed network consists of dilated and dense neighborhood attention transformers to enhance the distant neighborhood pixel relationship and introduce depth-wise convolutions within the transformer module to learn low-level translation invariant features for accelerated MRI image reconstruction. The proposed model is trained in a self-supervised manner. We perform extensive experiments for multi-coil MRI acceleration for coronal PD, coronal PDFS and axial T2 contrasts with 4x and 5x under-sampling in self-supervised learning based on k-space splitting. We compare our method against other reconstruction architectures and the parallel domain self-supervised learning baseline. Results show that the proposed model exhibits improvement margins of (i) around 1.40 dB in PSNR and around 0.028 in SSIM on average over other architectures (ii) around 1.44 dB in PSNR and around 0.029 in SSIM over parallel domain self-supervised learning.
