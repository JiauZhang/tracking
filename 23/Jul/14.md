**Title:** ConvNeXt-ChARM: ConvNeXt-based Transform for Efficient Neural Image  Compression  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06342  
**Abstract:** Over the last few years, neural image compression has gained wide attention from research and industry, yielding promising end-to-end deep neural codecs outperforming their conventional counterparts in rate-distortion performance. Despite significant advancement, current methods, including attention-based transform coding, still need to be improved in reducing the coding rate while preserving the reconstruction fidelity, especially in non-homogeneous textured image areas. Those models also require more parameters and a higher decoding time. To tackle the above challenges, we propose ConvNeXt-ChARM, an efficient ConvNeXt-based transform coding framework, paired with a compute-efficient channel-wise auto-regressive prior to capturing both global and local contexts from the hyper and quantized latent representations. The proposed architecture can be optimized end-to-end to fully exploit the context information and extract compact latent representation while reconstructing higher-quality images. Experimental results on four widely-used datasets showed that ConvNeXt-ChARM brings consistent and significant BD-rate (PSNR) reductions estimated on average to 5.24% and 1.22% over the versatile video coding (VVC) reference encoder (VTM-18.0) and the state-of-the-art learned image compression method SwinT-ChARM, respectively. Moreover, we provide model scaling studies to verify the computational efficiency of our approach and conduct several objective and subjective analyses to bring to the fore the performance gap between the next generation ConvNet, namely ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06391  
**Abstract:** ChatGPT is a generative pretrained transformer language model created using artificial intelligence implemented as chatbot which can provide very detailed responses to a wide variety of questions. As a very contemporary phenomenon, this tool has a wide variety of potential use cases that have yet to be explored. With the significant extent of information on a broad assortment of potential topics, ChatGPT could add value to many information security uses cases both from an efficiency perspective as well as to offer another source of security information that could be used to assist with securing Internet accessible assets of organizations. One information security practice that could benefit from ChatGPT is the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing. This research uses a case study methodology to explore and investigate the uses of ChatGPT in obtaining valuable reconnaissance data. ChatGPT is able to provide many types of intel regarding targeted properties which includes Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges, domain names, network topology, vendor technologies, SSL/TLS ciphers, ports & services, and operating systems used by the target. The reconnaissance information can then be used during the planning phase of a penetration test to determine the tactics, tools, and techniques to guide the later phases of the penetration test in order to discover potential risks such as unpatched software components and security misconfiguration related issues. The study provides insights into how artificial intelligence language models can be used in cybersecurity and contributes to the advancement of penetration testing techniques.

**Title:** RaBiT: An Efficient Transformer using Bidirectional Feature Pyramid  Network with Reverse Attention for Colon Polyp Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06420  
**Abstract:** Automatic and accurate segmentation of colon polyps is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Advanced deep learning models have shown promising results in polyp segmentation. However, they still have limitations in representing multi-scale features and generalization capability. To address these issues, this paper introduces RaBiT, an encoder-decoder model that incorporates a lightweight Transformer-based architecture in the encoder to model multiple-level global semantic relationships. The decoder consists of several bidirectional feature pyramid layers with reverse attention modules to better fuse feature maps at various levels and incrementally refine polyp boundaries. We also propose ideas to lighten the reverse attention module and make it more suitable for multi-class segmentation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods across all datasets while maintaining low computational complexity. Moreover, our method demonstrates high generalization capability in cross-dataset experiments, even when the training and test sets have different characteristics.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including health applications. In this paper, we study how LLMs can be used to scale biomedical knowledge curation. We find that while LLMs already possess decent competency in structuring biomedical text, by distillation into a task-specific student model through self-supervised learning, substantial gains can be attained over out-of-box LLMs, with additional advantages such as cost, efficiency, and white-box model access.

**Title:** No Train No Gain: Revisiting Efficient Training Algorithms For  Transformer-based Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06440  
**Abstract:** The computation necessary for training Transformer-based language models has skyrocketed in recent years. This trend has motivated research on efficient training algorithms designed to improve training, validation, and downstream performance faster than standard training. In this work, we revisit three categories of such algorithms: dynamic architectures (layer stacking, layer dropping), batch selection (selective backprop, RHO loss), and efficient optimizers (Lion, Sophia). When pre-training BERT and T5 with a fixed computation budget using such methods, we find that their training, validation, and downstream gains vanish compared to a baseline with a fully-decayed learning rate. We define an evaluation protocol that enables computation to be done on arbitrary machines by mapping all computation time to a reference machine which we call reference system time. We discuss the limitations of our proposed protocol and release our code to encourage rigorous research in efficient training procedures: https://github.com/JeanKaddour/NoTrainNoGain.

**Title:** Efficient Convolution and Transformer-Based Network for Video Frame  Interpolation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06443  
**Abstract:** Video frame interpolation is an increasingly important research task with several key industrial applications in the video coding, broadcast and production sectors. Recently, transformers have been introduced to the field resulting in substantial performance gains. However, this comes at a cost of greatly increased memory usage, training and inference time. In this paper, a novel method integrating a transformer encoder and convolutional features is proposed. This network reduces the memory burden by close to 50% and runs up to four times faster during inference time compared to existing transformer-based interpolation methods. A dual-encoder architecture is introduced which combines the strength of convolutions in modelling local correlations with those of the transformer for long-range dependencies. Quantitative evaluations are conducted on various benchmarks with complex motion to showcase the robustness of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art interpolation networks.

**Title:** Assessing the Ability of ChatGPT to Screen Articles for Systematic  Reviews  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06464  
**Abstract:** By organizing knowledge within a research field, Systematic Reviews (SR) provide valuable leads to steer research. Evidence suggests that SRs have become first-class artifacts in software engineering. However, the tedious manual effort associated with the screening phase of SRs renders these studies a costly and error-prone endeavor. While screening has traditionally been considered not amenable to automation, the advent of generative AI-driven chatbots, backed with large language models is set to disrupt the field. In this report, we propose an approach to leverage these novel technological developments for automating the screening of SRs. We assess the consistency, classification performance, and generalizability of ChatGPT in screening articles for SRs and compare these figures with those of traditional classifiers used in SR automation. Our results indicate that ChatGPT is a viable option to automate the SR processes, but requires careful considerations from developers when integrating ChatGPT into their SR tools.

**Title:** Improving Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Classification Performance  With Latent Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06507  
**Abstract:** Integrating deep learning with clinical expertise holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges and empowering medical professionals with improved diagnostic tools. However, the need for annotated medical images is often an obstacle to leveraging the full power of machine learning models. Our research demonstrates that by combining synthetic images, generated using diffusion models, with real images, we can enhance nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) classification performance. We evaluate the quality of the synthetic images by comparing two metrics: Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID), computed on diffusion-generated images and generative adversarial networks (GANs)-generated images. Our results show superior performance for the diffusion-generated images, with a maximum IS score of $1.90$ compared to $1.67$ for GANs, and a minimum FID score of $69.45$ compared to $99.53$ for GANs. Utilizing a partially frozen CNN backbone (EfficientNet v1), our synthetic augmentation method achieves a maximum image-level ROC AUC of $0.904$ on a NAFLD prediction task.

**Title:** Agreement Tracking for Multi-Issue Negotiation Dialogues  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06524  
**Abstract:** Automated negotiation support systems aim to help human negotiators reach more favorable outcomes in multi-issue negotiations (e.g., an employer and a candidate negotiating over issues such as salary, hours, and promotions before a job offer). To be successful, these systems must accurately track agreements reached by participants in real-time. Existing approaches either focus on task-oriented dialogues or produce unstructured outputs, rendering them unsuitable for this objective. Our work introduces the novel task of agreement tracking for two-party multi-issue negotiations, which requires continuous monitoring of agreements within a structured state space. To address the scarcity of annotated corpora with realistic multi-issue negotiation dialogues, we use GPT-3 to build GPT-Negochat, a synthesized dataset that we make publicly available. We present a strong initial baseline for our task by transfer-learning a T5 model trained on the MultiWOZ 2.4 corpus. Pre-training T5-small and T5-base on MultiWOZ 2.4's DST task enhances results by 21% and 9% respectively over training solely on GPT-Negochat. We validate our method's sample-efficiency via smaller training subset experiments. By releasing GPT-Negochat and our baseline models, we aim to encourage further research in multi-issue negotiation dialogue agreement tracking.

**Title:** AvatarFusion: Zero-shot Generation of Clothing-Decoupled 3D Avatars  Using 2D Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06526  
**Abstract:** Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models allow for the zero-shot text-based generation of 3D avatars. The previous state-of-the-art method utilized CLIP to supervise neural implicit models that reconstructed a human body mesh. However, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the lack of avatar-specific models can cause facial distortion and unrealistic clothing in the generated avatars. Secondly, CLIP only provides optimization direction for the overall appearance, resulting in less impressive results. To address these limitations, we propose AvatarFusion, the first framework to use a latent diffusion model to provide pixel-level guidance for generating human-realistic avatars while simultaneously segmenting clothing from the avatar's body. AvatarFusion includes the first clothing-decoupled neural implicit avatar model that employs a novel Dual Volume Rendering strategy to render the decoupled skin and clothing sub-models in one space. We also introduce a novel optimization method, called Pixel-Semantics Difference-Sampling (PS-DS), which semantically separates the generation of body and clothes, and generates a variety of clothing styles. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark for zero-shot text-to-avatar generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous approaches, with significant improvements observed in all metrics. Additionally, since our model is clothing-decoupled, we can exchange the clothes of avatars. Code will be available on Github.

**Title:** Exploring the Integration of Large Language Models into Automatic Speech  Recognition Systems: An Empirical Study  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06530  
**Abstract:** This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to improve transcription accuracy. The increasing sophistication of LLMs, with their in-context learning capabilities and instruction-following behavior, has drawn significant attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our primary focus is to investigate the potential of using an LLM's in-context learning capabilities to enhance the performance of ASR systems, which currently face challenges such as ambient noise, speaker accents, and complex linguistic contexts. We designed a study using the Aishell-1 and LibriSpeech datasets, with ChatGPT and GPT-4 serving as benchmarks for LLM capabilities. Unfortunately, our initial experiments did not yield promising results, indicating the complexity of leveraging LLM's in-context learning for ASR applications. Despite further exploration with varied settings and models, the corrected sentences from the LLMs frequently resulted in higher Word Error Rates (WER), demonstrating the limitations of LLMs in speech applications. This paper provides a detailed overview of these experiments, their results, and implications, establishing that using LLMs' in-context learning capabilities to correct potential errors in speech recognition transcriptions is still a challenging task at the current stage.

**Title:** Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis on Weibo Data: A  Natural Language Processing Approach  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06540  
**Abstract:** This study addressed the complex task of sentiment analysis on a dataset of 119,988 original tweets from Weibo using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), offering a new approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The data, sourced from Baidu's PaddlePaddle AI platform, were meticulously preprocessed, tokenized, and categorized based on sentiment labels. A CNN-based model was utilized, leveraging word embeddings for feature extraction, and trained to perform sentiment classification. The model achieved a macro-average F1-score of approximately 0.73 on the test set, showing balanced performance across positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. The findings underscore the effectiveness of CNNs for sentiment analysis tasks, with implications for practical applications in social media analysis, market research, and policy studies. The complete experimental content and code have been made publicly available on the Kaggle data platform for further research and development. Future work may involve exploring different architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or transformers, or using more complex pre-trained models like BERT, to further improve the model's ability to understand linguistic nuances and context.

**Title:** A Study on Differentiable Logic and LLMs for EPIC-KITCHENS-100  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Challenge for Action Recognition 2023  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06569  
**Abstract:** In this technical report, we present our findings from a study conducted on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation task for Action Recognition. Our research focuses on the innovative application of a differentiable logic loss in the training to leverage the co-occurrence relations between verb and noun, as well as the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the logic rules for the adaptation to unseen action labels. Specifically, the model's predictions are treated as the truth assignment of a co-occurrence logic formula to compute the logic loss, which measures the consistency between the predictions and the logic constraints. By using the verb-noun co-occurrence matrix generated from the dataset, we observe a moderate improvement in model performance compared to our baseline framework. To further enhance the model's adaptability to novel action labels, we experiment with rules generated using GPT-3.5, which leads to a slight decrease in performance. These findings shed light on the potential and challenges of incorporating differentiable logic and LLMs for knowledge extraction in unsupervised domain adaptation for action recognition. Our final submission (entitled `NS-LLM') achieved the first place in terms of top-1 action recognition accuracy.

**Title:** Introducing Foundation Models as Surrogate Models: Advancing Towards  More Practical Adversarial Attacks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06608  
**Abstract:** Recently, the no-box adversarial attack, in which the attacker lacks access to the model's architecture, weights, and training data, become the most practical and challenging attack setup. However, there is an unawareness of the potential and flexibility inherent in the surrogate model selection process on no-box setting. Inspired by the burgeoning interest in utilizing foundational models to address downstream tasks, this paper adopts an innovative idea that 1) recasting adversarial attack as a downstream task. Specifically, image noise generation to meet the emerging trend and 2) introducing foundational models as surrogate models. Harnessing the concept of non-robust features, we elaborate on two guiding principles for surrogate model selection to explain why the foundational model is an optimal choice for this role. However, paradoxically, we observe that these foundational models underperform. Analyzing this unexpected behavior within the feature space, we attribute the lackluster performance of foundational models (e.g., CLIP) to their significant representational capacity and, conversely, their lack of discriminative prowess. To mitigate this issue, we propose the use of a margin-based loss strategy for the fine-tuning of foundational models on target images. The experimental results verify that our approach, which employs the basic Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack algorithm, outstrips the performance of other, more convoluted algorithms. We conclude by advocating for the research community to consider surrogate models as crucial determinants in the effectiveness of adversarial attacks in no-box settings. The implications of our work bear relevance for improving the efficacy of such adversarial attacks and the overall robustness of AI systems.

**Title:** Making local algorithms efficiently self-stabilizing in arbitrary  asynchronous environments  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06635  
**Abstract:** This paper deals with the trade-off between time, workload, and versatility in self-stabilization, a general and lightweight fault-tolerant concept in distributed computing.In this context, we propose a transformer that provides an asynchronous silent self-stabilizing version Trans(AlgI) of any terminating synchronous algorithm AlgI. The transformed algorithm Trans(AlgI) works under the distributed unfair daemon and is efficient both in moves and rounds.Our transformer allows to easily obtain fully-polynomial silent self-stabilizing solutions that are also asymptotically optimal in rounds.We illustrate the efficiency and versatility of our transformer with several efficient (i.e., fully-polynomial) silent self-stabilizing instances solving major distributed computing problems, namely vertex coloring, Breadth-First Search (BFS) spanning tree construction, k-clustering, and leader election.

**Title:** Transformer-based end-to-end classification of variable-length  volumetric data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06666  
**Abstract:** The automatic classification of 3D medical data is memory-intensive. Also, variations in the number of slices between samples is common. Naive solutions such as subsampling can solve these problems, but at the cost of potentially eliminating relevant diagnosis information. Transformers have shown promising performance for sequential data analysis. However, their application for long-sequences is data, computationally, and memory demanding. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Transformer-based framework that allows to classify volumetric data of variable length in an efficient fashion. Particularly, by randomizing the input slice-wise resolution during training, we enhance the capacity of the learnable positional embedding assigned to each volume slice. Consequently, the accumulated positional information in each positional embedding can be generalized to the neighbouring slices, even for high resolution volumes at the test time. By doing so, the model will be more robust to variable volume length and amenable to different computational budgets. We evaluated the proposed approach in retinal OCT volume classification and achieved 21.96% average improvement in balanced accuracy on a 9-class diagnostic task, compared to state-of-the-art video transformers. Our findings show that varying the slice-wise resolution of the input during training results in more informative volume representation as compared to training with fixed number of slices per volume.

**Title:** MPR-Net:Multi-Scale Pattern Reproduction Guided Universality Time Series  Interpretable Forecasting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06736  
**Abstract:** Time series forecasting has received wide interest from existing research due to its broad applications and inherent challenging. The research challenge lies in identifying effective patterns in historical series and applying them to future forecasting. Advanced models based on point-wise connected MLP and Transformer architectures have strong fitting power, but their secondary computational complexity limits practicality. Additionally, those structures inherently disrupt the temporal order, reducing the information utilization and making the forecasting process uninterpretable. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a forecasting model, MPR-Net. It first adaptively decomposes multi-scale historical series patterns using convolution operation, then constructs a pattern extension forecasting method based on the prior knowledge of pattern reproduction, and finally reconstructs future patterns into future series using deconvolution operation. By leveraging the temporal dependencies present in the time series, MPR-Net not only achieves linear time complexity, but also makes the forecasting process interpretable. By carrying out sufficient experiments on more than ten real data sets of both short and long term forecasting tasks, MPR-Net achieves the state of the art forecasting performance, as well as good generalization and robustness performance.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06794  
**Abstract:** Larger language models, such as GPT-3, have shown to be excellent in many tasks. However, we demonstrate that out-of-ordinary questions can throw the model off guard. This work focuses on finding answers to negated complementary questions in commonsense scenarios. We illustrate how such questions adversely affect the model responses. We propose a model-agnostic methodology to improve the performance in negated complementary scenarios. Our method outperforms few-shot generation from GPT-3 (by more than 11 points) and, more importantly, highlights the significance of studying the response of large language models in negated complementary questions. The code, data, and experiments are available under: https://github.com/navidre/negated_complementary_commonsense.

**Abstract:** Vision-language foundation models such as CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot performance on many tasks and datasets, especially thanks to their free-text inputs. However, they struggle to handle some downstream tasks, such as fine-grained attribute detection and localization. In this paper, we propose a multitask fine-tuning strategy based on a positive/negative prompt formulation to further leverage the capacities of the vision-language foundation models. Using the CLIP architecture as baseline, we show strong improvements on bird fine-grained attribute detection and localization tasks, while also increasing the classification performance on the CUB200-2011 dataset. We provide source code for reproducibility purposes: it is available at https://github.com/FactoDeepLearning/MultitaskVLFM.

**Title:** Data-driven Nonlinear Parametric Model Order Reduction Framework using  Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06816  
**Abstract:** A data-driven parametric model order reduction (MOR) method using a deep artificial neural network is proposed. The present network, which is the least-squares hierarchical variational autoencoder (LSH-VAE), is capable of performing nonlinear MOR for the parametric interpolation of a nonlinear dynamic system with a significant number of degrees of freedom. LSH-VAE exploits two major changes to the existing networks: a hierarchical deep structure and a hybrid weighted, probabilistic loss function. The enhancements result in a significantly improved accuracy and stability compared against the conventional nonlinear MOR methods, autoencoder, and variational autoencoder. Upon LSH-VAE, a parametric MOR framework is presented based on the spherically linear interpolation of the latent manifold. The present framework is validated and evaluated on three nonlinear and multiphysics dynamic systems. First, the present framework is evaluated on the fluid-structure interaction benchmark problem to assess its efficiency and accuracy. Then, a highly nonlinear aeroelastic phenomenon, limit cycle oscillation, is analyzed. Finally, the present framework is applied to a three-dimensional fluid flow to demonstrate its capability of efficiently analyzing a significantly large number of degrees of freedom. The performance of LSH-VAE is emphasized by comparing its results against that of the widely used nonlinear MOR methods, convolutional autoencoder, and $\beta$-VAE. The present framework exhibits a significantly enhanced accuracy to the conventional methods while still exhibiting a large speed-up factor.

KGs surpass any other form of representation in terms of effectiveness. However, Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE) requires in-depth experiences of graph structures, web technologies, existing models and vocabularies, rule sets, logic, as well as best practices. It also demands a significant amount of work. Considering the advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their interfaces and applications in recent years, we have conducted comprehensive experiments with ChatGPT to explore its potential in supporting KGE. In this paper, we present a selection of these experiments and their results to demonstrate how ChatGPT can assist us in the development and management of KGs.

**Title:** Domain-Agnostic Tuning-Encoder for Fast Personalization of Text-To-Image  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06925  
**Abstract:** Text-to-image (T2I) personalization allows users to guide the creative image generation process by combining their own visual concepts in natural language prompts. Recently, encoder-based techniques have emerged as a new effective approach for T2I personalization, reducing the need for multiple images and long training times. However, most existing encoders are limited to a single-class domain, which hinders their ability to handle diverse concepts. In this work, we propose a domain-agnostic method that does not require any specialized dataset or prior information about the personalized concepts. We introduce a novel contrastive-based regularization technique to maintain high fidelity to the target concept characteristics while keeping the predicted embeddings close to editable regions of the latent space, by pushing the predicted tokens toward their nearest existing CLIP tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show how the learned tokens are more semantic than tokens predicted by unregularized models. This leads to a better representation that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible than previous methods.

**Title:** Video-FocalNets: Spatio-Temporal Focal Modulation for Video Action  Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06947  
**Abstract:** Recent video recognition models utilize Transformer models for long-range spatio-temporal context modeling. Video transformer designs are based on self-attention that can model global context at a high computational cost. In comparison, convolutional designs for videos offer an efficient alternative but lack long-range dependency modeling. Towards achieving the best of both designs, this work proposes Video-FocalNet, an effective and efficient architecture for video recognition that models both local and global contexts. Video-FocalNet is based on a spatio-temporal focal modulation architecture that reverses the interaction and aggregation steps of self-attention for better efficiency. Further, the aggregation step and the interaction step are both implemented using efficient convolution and element-wise multiplication operations that are computationally less expensive than their self-attention counterparts on video representations. We extensively explore the design space of focal modulation-based spatio-temporal context modeling and demonstrate our parallel spatial and temporal encoding design to be the optimal choice. Video-FocalNets perform favorably well against the state-of-the-art transformer-based models for video recognition on three large-scale datasets (Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and SS-v2) at a lower computational cost. Our code/models are released at https://github.com/TalalWasim/Video-FocalNets.

**Title:** Self-regulating Prompts: Foundational Model Adaptation without  Forgetting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06948  
**Abstract:** Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient alternative for fine-tuning foundational models, such as CLIP, for various downstream tasks. Conventionally trained using the task-specific objective, i.e., cross-entropy loss, prompts tend to overfit downstream data distributions and find it challenging to capture task-agnostic general features from the frozen CLIP. This leads to the loss of the model's original generalization capability. To address this issue, our work introduces a self-regularization framework for prompting called PromptSRC (Prompting with Self-regulating Constraints). PromptSRC guides the prompts to optimize for both task-specific and task-agnostic general representations using a three-pronged approach by: (a) regulating {prompted} representations via mutual agreement maximization with the frozen model, (b) regulating with self-ensemble of prompts over the training trajectory to encode their complementary strengths, and (c) regulating with textual diversity to mitigate sample diversity imbalance with the visual branch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first regularization framework for prompt learning that avoids overfitting by jointly attending to pre-trained model features, the training trajectory during prompting, and the textual diversity. PromptSRC explicitly steers the prompts to learn a representation space that maximizes performance on downstream tasks without compromising CLIP generalization. We perform extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks where PromptSRC overall performs favorably well compared to the existing methods. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/muzairkhattak/PromptSRC.

**Title:** HyperDreamBooth: HyperNetworks for Fast Personalization of Text-to-Image  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06949  
**Abstract:** Personalization has emerged as a prominent aspect within the field of generative AI, enabling the synthesis of individuals in diverse contexts and styles, while retaining high-fidelity to their identities. However, the process of personalization presents inherent challenges in terms of time and memory requirements. Fine-tuning each personalized model needs considerable GPU time investment, and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyperDreamBooth-a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model, coupled with fast finetuning, HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles, with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in roughly 20 seconds, 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual Inversion, using as few as one reference image, with the same quality and style diversity as DreamBooth. Also our method yields a model that is 10000x smaller than a normal DreamBooth model. Project page: https://hyperdreambooth.github.io

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06338  
**Abstract:** In this work, a denoising Cycle-GAN (Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network) is implemented to yield high-field, high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images from simulated low-field, low resolution, low SNR MRI images. Resampling and additive Rician noise were used to simulate low-field MRI. Images were utilized to train a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and a Cycle-GAN, with paired and unpaired cases. Both networks were evaluated using SSIM and PSNR image quality metrics. This work demonstrates the use of a generative deep learning model that can outperform classical DAEs to improve low-field MRI images and does not require image pairs.

**Title:** Personalization for BERT-based Discriminative Speech Recognition  Rescoring  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06832  
**Abstract:** Recognition of personalized content remains a challenge in end-to-end speech recognition. We explore three novel approaches that use personalized content in a neural rescoring step to improve recognition: gazetteers, prompting, and a cross-attention based encoder-decoder model. We use internal de-identified en-US data from interactions with a virtual voice assistant supplemented with personalized named entities to compare these approaches. On a test set with personalized named entities, we show that each of these approaches improves word error rate by over 10%, against a neural rescoring baseline. We also show that on this test set, natural language prompts can improve word error rate by 7% without any training and with a marginal loss in generalization. Overall, gazetteers were found to perform the best with a 10% improvement in word error rate (WER), while also improving WER on a general test set by 1%.

By leveraging a new diffusion formulation, studying more recent integration solvers, and training on all jet types simultaneously, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance for all types of jets across all evaluation metrics. We study the trade-off between generation speed and quality by comparing two attention based architectures, as well as the potential of consistency distillation to reduce the number of diffusion steps. Both the faster architecture and consistency models demonstrate performance surpassing many competing models, with generation time up to two orders of magnitude faster than PC-JeDi.
