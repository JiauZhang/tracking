**Title:** Copilot for Xcode: Exploring AI-Assisted Programming by Prompting  Cloud-based Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14349  
**Abstract:** This paper presents an AI-assisted programming tool called Copilot for Xcode for program composition and design to support human software developers. By seamlessly integrating cloud-based Large Language Models (LLM) with Apple's local development environment, Xcode, this tool enhances productivity and unleashes creativity for software development in Apple software ecosystem (e.g., iOS apps, macOS). Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Copilot for Xcode effectively processes source code tokens and patterns within code repositories, enabling features such as code generation, autocompletion, documentation, and error detection. Software developers can also query and make "small" decisions for program composition, some of which can be made simultaneously, and this is facilitated through prompt engineering in a chat interface of Copilot for Xcode. Finally, we present simple case studies as evidence of the effectiveness of utilizing NLP in Xcode to prompt popular LLM services like OpenAI ChatGPT for program composition and design.

**Title:** How Can Large Language Models Help Humans in Design and Manufacturing?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14377  
**Abstract:** The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, provides exciting new opportunities for generative design. We investigate the application of this tool across the entire design and manufacturing workflow. Specifically, we scrutinize the utility of LLMs in tasks such as: converting a text-based prompt into a design specification, transforming a design into manufacturing instructions, producing a design space and design variations, computing the performance of a design, and searching for designs predicated on performance. Through a series of examples, we highlight both the benefits and the limitations of the current LLMs. By exposing these limitations, we aspire to catalyze the continued improvement and progression of these models.

**Title:** Leveraging Large Language Models for Mental Health Prediction via Online  Text Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14385  
**Abstract:** The recent technology boost of large language models (LLMs) has empowered a variety of applications. However, there is very little research on understanding and improving LLMs' capability for the mental health domain. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs, including Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, and GPT-3.5, on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data. We conduct a wide range of experiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction finetuning. The results indicate the promising yet limited performance of LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for mental health tasks. More importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly boost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned model, Mental-Alpaca, outperforms GPT-3.5 (25 times bigger) by 16.7\% on balanced accuracy and performs on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific model. We summarize our findings into a set of action guidelines for future researchers, engineers, and practitioners on how to empower LLMs with better mental health domain knowledge and become an expert in mental health prediction tasks.

**Title:** Integrating Offline Reinforcement Learning with Transformers for  Sequential Recommendation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14450  
**Abstract:** We consider the problem of sequential recommendation, where the current recommendation is made based on past interactions. This recommendation task requires efficient processing of the sequential data and aims to provide recommendations that maximize the long-term reward. To this end, we train a farsighted recommender by using an offline RL algorithm with the policy network in our model architecture that has been initialized from a pre-trained transformer model. The pre-trained model leverages the superb ability of the transformer to process sequential information. Compared to prior works that rely on online interaction via simulation, we focus on implementing a fully offline RL framework that is able to converge in a fast and stable way. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we show that our method is robust across various recommendation regimes, including e-commerce and movie suggestions. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms, our algorithm yields recommendations of higher quality, demonstrating the clear advantage of combining RL and transformers.

**Title:** MiDaS v3.1 -- A Model Zoo for Robust Monocular Relative Depth Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14460  
**Abstract:** We release MiDaS v3.1 for monocular depth estimation, offering a variety of new models based on different encoder backbones. This release is motivated by the success of transformers in computer vision, with a large variety of pretrained vision transformers now available. We explore how using the most promising vision transformers as image encoders impacts depth estimation quality and runtime of the MiDaS architecture. Our investigation also includes recent convolutional approaches that achieve comparable quality to vision transformers in image classification tasks. While the previous release MiDaS v3.0 solely leverages the vanilla vision transformer ViT, MiDaS v3.1 offers additional models based on BEiT, Swin, SwinV2, Next-ViT and LeViT. These models offer different performance-runtime tradeoffs. The best model improves the depth estimation quality by 28% while efficient models enable downstream tasks requiring high frame rates. We also describe the general process for integrating new backbones.

**Title:** CliniDigest: A Case Study in Large Language Model Based Large-Scale  Summarization of Clinical Trial Descriptions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14522  
**Abstract:** A clinical trial is a study that evaluates new biomedical interventions. To design new trials, researchers draw inspiration from those current and completed. In 2022, there were on average more than 100 clinical trials submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov every day, with each trial having a mean of approximately 1500 words [1]. This makes it nearly impossible to keep up to date. To mitigate this issue, we have created a batch clinical trial summarizer called CliniDigest using GPT-3.5. CliniDigest is, to our knowledge, the first tool able to provide real-time, truthful, and comprehensive summaries of clinical trials. CliniDigest can reduce up to 85 clinical trial descriptions (approximately 10,500 words) into a concise 200-word summary with references and limited hallucinations. We have tested CliniDigest on its ability to summarize 457 trials divided across 27 medical subdomains. For each field, CliniDigest generates summaries of $\mu=153,\ \sigma=69 $ words, each of which utilizes $\mu=54\%,\ \sigma=30\% $ of the sources. A more comprehensive evaluation is planned and outlined in this paper.

**Title:** Scaling Up and Distilling Down: Language-Guided Robot Skill Acquisition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14535  
**Abstract:** We present a framework for robot skill acquisition, which 1) efficiently scale up data generation of language-labelled robot data and 2) effectively distills this data down into a robust multi-task language-conditioned visuo-motor policy. For (1), we use a large language model (LLM) to guide high-level planning, and sampling-based robot planners (e.g. motion or grasp samplers) for generating diverse and rich manipulation trajectories. To robustify this data-collection process, the LLM also infers a code-snippet for the success condition of each task, simultaneously enabling the data-collection process to detect failure and retry as well as the automatic labeling of trajectories with success/failure. For (2), we extend the diffusion policy single-task behavior-cloning approach to multi-task settings with language conditioning. Finally, we propose a new multi-task benchmark with 18 tasks across five domains to test long-horizon behavior, common-sense reasoning, tool-use, and intuitive physics. We find that our distilled policy successfully learned the robust retrying behavior in its data collection policy, while improving absolute success rates by 34.8% on average across five domains. The benchmark, code, and qualitative results are on our website https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~huy/scalingup/

**Title:** Speed Reading Tool Powered by Artificial Intelligence for Students with  ADHD, Dyslexia, or Short Attention Span  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14544  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel approach to assist students with dyslexia, ADHD, and short attention span in digesting any text-based information more efficiently. The proposed solution utilizes the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm for complex text processing and summarization tasks. The tool leverages the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model from Hugging Face, which treats every NLP task as a text generation task. The model is fine-tuned on specific tasks using a smaller dataset. The NLTK's Punkt Sentence Tokenizer is used to divide a text into a list of sentences. The application is served using Flask, a lightweight web server and framework. The tool also applies principles from Bionic Reading to enhance readability, which includes a bolding function and adjustments to line, word, and character spacing. The paper discusses the methodology, implementation, and results of the AI-based speed reading tool.

**Title:** HUTFormer: Hierarchical U-Net Transformer for Long-Term Traffic  Forecasting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14596  
**Abstract:** Traffic forecasting, which aims to predict traffic conditions based on historical observations, has been an enduring research topic and is widely recognized as an essential component of intelligent transportation. Recent proposals on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have made significant progress by combining sequential models with graph convolution networks. However, due to high complexity issues, STGNNs only focus on short-term traffic forecasting, e.g., 1-hour forecasting, while ignoring more practical long-term forecasting. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore long-term traffic forecasting, e.g., 1-day forecasting. To this end, we first reveal its unique challenges in exploiting multi-scale representations. Then, we propose a novel Hierarchical U-net TransFormer (HUTFormer) to address the issues of long-term traffic forecasting. HUTFormer consists of a hierarchical encoder and decoder to jointly generate and utilize multi-scale representations of traffic data. Specifically, for the encoder, we propose window self-attention and segment merging to extract multi-scale representations from long-term traffic data. For the decoder, we design a cross-scale attention mechanism to effectively incorporate multi-scale representations. In addition, HUTFormer employs an efficient input embedding strategy to address the complexity issues. Extensive experiments on four traffic datasets show that the proposed HUTFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traffic forecasting and long time series forecasting baselines.

**Title:** Clustering based Point Cloud Representation Learning for 3D Analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14605  
**Abstract:** Point cloud analysis (such as 3D segmentation and detection) is a challenging task, because of not only the irregular geometries of many millions of unordered points, but also the great variations caused by depth, viewpoint, occlusion, etc. Current studies put much focus on the adaption of neural networks to the complex geometries of point clouds, but are blind to a fundamental question: how to learn an appropriate point embedding space that is aware of both discriminative semantics and challenging variations? As a response, we propose a clustering based supervised learning scheme for point cloud analysis. Unlike current de-facto, scene-wise training paradigm, our algorithm conducts within-class clustering on the point embedding space for automatically discovering subclass patterns which are latent yet representative across scenes. The mined patterns are, in turn, used to repaint the embedding space, so as to respect the underlying distribution of the entire training dataset and improve the robustness to the variations. Our algorithm is principled and readily pluggable to modern point cloud segmentation networks during training, without extra overhead during testing. With various 3D network architectures (i.e., voxel-based, point-based, Transformer-based, automatically searched), our algorithm shows notable improvements on famous point cloud segmentation datasets (i.e.,2.0-2.6% on single-scan and 2.0-2.2% multi-scan of SemanticKITTI, 1.8-1.9% on S3DIS, in terms of mIoU). Our algorithm also demonstrates utility in 3D detection, showing 2.0-3.4% mAP gains on KITTI.

**Title:** Self-Contrastive Graph Diffusion Network  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14613  
**Abstract:** Augmentation techniques and sampling strategies are crucial in contrastive learning, but in most existing works, augmentation techniques require careful design, and their sampling strategies can only capture a small amount of intrinsic supervision information. Additionally, the existing methods require complex designs to obtain two different representations of the data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called the Self-Contrastive Graph Diffusion Network (SCGDN). Our framework consists of two main components: the Attentional Module (AttM) and the Diffusion Module (DiFM). AttM aggregates higher-order structure and feature information to get an excellent embedding, while DiFM balances the state of each node in the graph through Laplacian diffusion learning and allows the cooperative evolution of adjacency and feature information in the graph. Unlike existing methodologies, SCGDN is an augmentation-free approach that avoids "sampling bias" and semantic drift, without the need for pre-training. We conduct a high-quality sampling of samples based on structure and feature information. If two nodes are neighbors, they are considered positive samples of each other. If two disconnected nodes are also unrelated on $k$NN graph, they are considered negative samples for each other. The contrastive objective reasonably uses our proposed sampling strategies, and the redundancy reduction term minimizes redundant information in the embedding and can well retain more discriminative information. In this novel framework, the graph self-contrastive learning paradigm gives expression to a powerful force. SCGDN effectively balances between preserving high-order structure information and avoiding overfitting. The results manifest that SCGDN can consistently generate outperformance over both the contrastive methods and the classical methods.

**Title:** Imitating Complex Trajectories: Bridging Low-Level Stability and  High-Level Behavior  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14619  
**Abstract:** We propose a theoretical framework for studying the imitation of stochastic, non-Markovian, potentially multi-modal (i.e. "complex" ) expert demonstrations in nonlinear dynamical systems. Our framework invokes low-level controllers - either learned or implicit in position-command control - to stabilize imitation policies around expert demonstrations. We show that with (a) a suitable low-level stability guarantee and (b) a stochastic continuity property of the learned policy we call "total variation continuity" (TVC), an imitator that accurately estimates actions on the demonstrator's state distribution closely matches the demonstrator's distribution over entire trajectories. We then show that TVC can be ensured with minimal degradation of accuracy by combining a popular data-augmentation regimen with a novel algorithmic trick: adding augmentation noise at execution time. We instantiate our guarantees for policies parameterized by diffusion models and prove that if the learner accurately estimates the score of the (noise-augmented) expert policy, then the distribution of imitator trajectories is close to the demonstrator distribution in a natural optimal transport distance. Our analysis constructs intricate couplings between noise-augmented trajectories, a technique that may be of independent interest. We conclude by empirically validating our algorithmic recommendations.

**Title:** NeRF-Det: Learning Geometry-Aware Volumetric Representation for  Multi-View 3D Object Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14620  
**Abstract:** We present NeRF-Det, a novel method for indoor 3D detection with posed RGB images as input. Unlike existing indoor 3D detection methods that struggle to model scene geometry, our method makes novel use of NeRF in an end-to-end manner to explicitly estimate 3D geometry, thereby improving 3D detection performance. Specifically, to avoid the significant extra latency associated with per-scene optimization of NeRF, we introduce sufficient geometry priors to enhance the generalizability of NeRF-MLP. Furthermore, we subtly connect the detection and NeRF branches through a shared MLP, enabling an efficient adaptation of NeRF to detection and yielding geometry-aware volumetric representations for 3D detection. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.9 mAP and 3.1 mAP on the ScanNet and ARKITScenes benchmarks, respectively. We provide extensive analysis to shed light on how NeRF-Det works. As a result of our joint-training design, NeRF-Det is able to generalize well to unseen scenes for object detection, view synthesis, and depth estimation tasks without requiring per-scene optimization. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/NeRF-Det}.

**Title:** Metric-Based In-context Learning: A Case Study in Text Simplification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14632  
**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) for large language models has proven to be a powerful approach for many natural language processing tasks. However, determining the best method to select examples for ICL is nontrivial as the results can vary greatly depending on the quality, quantity, and order of examples used. In this paper, we conduct a case study on text simplification (TS) to investigate how to select the best and most robust examples for ICL. We propose Metric-Based in-context Learning (MBL) method that utilizes commonly used TS metrics such as SARI, compression ratio, and BERT-Precision for selection. Through an extensive set of experiments with various-sized GPT models on standard TS benchmarks such as TurkCorpus and ASSET, we show that examples selected by the top SARI scores perform the best on larger models such as GPT-175B, while the compression ratio generally performs better on smaller models such as GPT-13B and GPT-6.7B. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MBL is generally robust to example orderings and out-of-domain test sets, and outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art finetuned language models. Finally, we show that the behaviour of large GPT models can be implicitly controlled by the chosen metric. Our research provides a new framework for selecting examples in ICL, and demonstrates its effectiveness in text simplification tasks, breaking new ground for more accurate and efficient NLG systems.

**Title:** HTNet for micro-expression recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14637  
**Abstract:** Facial expression is related to facial muscle contractions and different muscle movements correspond to different emotional states. For micro-expression recognition, the muscle movements are usually subtle, which has a negative impact on the performance of current facial emotion recognition algorithms. Most existing methods use self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between tokens in a sequence, but they do not take into account the inherent spatial relationships between facial landmarks. This can result in sub-optimal performance on micro-expression recognition tasks.Therefore, learning to recognize facial muscle movements is a key challenge in the area of micro-expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer Network (HTNet) to identify critical areas of facial muscle movement. HTNet includes two major components: a transformer layer that leverages the local temporal features and an aggregation layer that extracts local and global semantical facial features. Specifically, HTNet divides the face into four different facial areas: left lip area, left eye area, right eye area and right lip area. The transformer layer is used to focus on representing local minor muscle movement with local self-attention in each area. The aggregation layer is used to learn the interactions between eye areas and lip areas. The experiments on four publicly available micro-expression datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin.

**Title:** Spatial-Frequency U-Net for Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14648  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) in wavelet space, instead of pixel space, for visual synthesis. Considering the wavelet transform represents the image in spatial and frequency domains, we carefully design a novel architecture SFUNet to effectively capture the correlation for both domains. Specifically, in the standard denoising U-Net for pixel data, we supplement the 2D convolutions and spatial-only attention layers with our spatial frequency-aware convolution and attention modules to jointly model the complementary information from spatial and frequency domains in wavelet data. Our new architecture can be used as a drop-in replacement to the pixel-based network and is compatible with the vanilla DDPM training process. By explicitly modeling the wavelet signals, we find our model is able to generate images with higher quality on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, LSUN-Bedroom, and LSUN-Church datasets, than the pixel-based counterpart.

**Title:** LLDiffusion: Learning Degradation Representations in Diffusion Models  for Low-Light Image Enhancement  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14659  
**Abstract:** Current deep learning methods for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) typically rely on pixel-wise mapping learned from paired data. However, these methods often overlook the importance of considering degradation representations, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a degradation-aware learning scheme for LLIE using diffusion models, which effectively integrates degradation and image priors into the diffusion process, resulting in improved image enhancement. Our proposed degradation-aware learning scheme is based on the understanding that degradation representations play a crucial role in accurately modeling and capturing the specific degradation patterns present in low-light images. To this end, First, a joint learning framework for both image generation and image enhancement is presented to learn the degradation representations. Second, to leverage the learned degradation representations, we develop a Low-Light Diffusion model (LLDiffusion) with a well-designed dynamic diffusion module. This module takes into account both the color map and the latent degradation representations to guide the diffusion process. By incorporating these conditioning factors, the proposed LLDiffusion can effectively enhance low-light images, considering both the inherent degradation patterns and the desired color fidelity. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on several well-known benchmark datasets, including synthetic and real-world unpaired datasets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our LLDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art LLIE methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/LLDiffusion.

**Title:** Improving Natural Language Inference in Arabic using Transformer Models  and Linguistically Informed Pre-Training  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14666  
**Abstract:** This paper addresses the classification of Arabic text data in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular focus on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Contradiction Detection (CD). Arabic is considered a resource-poor language, meaning that there are few data sets available, which leads to limited availability of NLP methods. To overcome this limitation, we create a dedicated data set from publicly available resources. Subsequently, transformer-based machine learning models are being trained and evaluated. We find that a language-specific model (AraBERT) performs competitively with state-of-the-art multilingual approaches, when we apply linguistically informed pre-training methods such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation for this task in Arabic, as well as the first application of multi-task pre-training in this context.

**Title:** MIM-OOD: Generative Masked Image Modelling for Out-of-Distribution  Detection in Medical Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14701  
**Abstract:** Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection consists in identifying anomalous regions in images leveraging only models trained on images of healthy anatomy. An established approach is to tokenize images and model the distribution of tokens with Auto-Regressive (AR) models. AR models are used to 1) identify anomalous tokens and 2) in-paint anomalous representations with in-distribution tokens. However, AR models are slow at inference time and prone to error accumulation issues which negatively affect OOD detection performance. Our novel method, MIM-OOD, overcomes both speed and error accumulation issues by replacing the AR model with two task-specific networks: 1) a transformer optimized to identify anomalous tokens and 2) a transformer optimized to in-paint anomalous tokens using masked image modelling (MIM). Our experiments with brain MRI anomalies show that MIM-OOD substantially outperforms AR models (DICE 0.458 vs 0.301) while achieving a nearly 25x speedup (9.5s vs 244s).

**Title:** Evaluating Generative Models for Graph-to-Text Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14712  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed for graph-to-text generation tasks. However, the process of finetuning LLMs requires significant training resources and annotation work. In this paper, we explore the capability of generative models to generate descriptive text from graph data in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we evaluate GPT-3 and ChatGPT on two graph-to-text datasets and compare their performance with that of finetuned LLM models such as T5 and BART. Our results demonstrate that generative models are capable of generating fluent and coherent text, achieving BLEU scores of 10.57 and 11.08 for the AGENDA and WebNLG datasets, respectively. However, our error analysis reveals that generative models still struggle with understanding the semantic relations between entities, and they also tend to generate text with hallucinations or irrelevant information. As a part of error analysis, we utilize BERT to detect machine-generated text and achieve high macro-F1 scores. We have made the text generated by generative models publicly available.

**Title:** New Interaction Paradigm for Complex EDA Software Leveraging GPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14740  
**Abstract:** In the rapidly growing field of electronic design automation (EDA), professional software such as KiCad, Cadence , and Altium Designer provide increasingly extensive design functionalities. However, the intricate command structure and high learning curve create a barrier, particularly for novice printed circuit board (PCB) designers. This results in difficulties in selecting appropriate functions or plugins for varying design purposes, compounded by the lack of intuitive learning methods beyond traditional documentation, videos, and online forums. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence (AI) interaction assist plugin for EDA software named SmartonAl is developed here, also KiCad is taken as the first example. SmartonAI is inspired by the HuggingGPT framework and employs large language models, such as GPT and BERT, to facilitate task planning and execution. On receiving a designer request, SmartonAI conducts a task breakdown and efficiently executes relevant subtasks, such as analysis of help documentation paragraphs and execution of different plugins, along with leveraging the built-in schematic and PCB manipulation functions in both SmartonAl itself and software. Our preliminary results demonstrate that SmartonAI can significantly streamline the PCB design process by simplifying complex commands into intuitive language-based interactions. By harnessing the powerful language capabilities of ChatGPT and the rich design functions of KiCad, the plugin effectively bridges the gap between complex EDA software and user-friendly interaction. Meanwhile, the new paradigm behind SmartonAI can also extend to other complex software systems, illustrating the immense potential of AI-assisted user interfaces in advancing digital interactions across various domains.

**Title:** Semantic Image Completion and Enhancement using GANs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14748  
**Abstract:** Semantic inpainting or image completion alludes to the task of inferring arbitrary large missing regions in images based on image semantics. Since the prediction of image pixels requires an indication of high-level context, this makes it significantly tougher than image completion, which is often more concerned with correcting data corruption and removing entire objects from the input image. On the other hand, image enhancement attempts to eliminate unwanted noise and blur from the image, along with sustaining most of the image details. Efficient image completion and enhancement model should be able to recover the corrupted and masked regions in images and then refine the image further to increase the quality of the output image. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), have turned out to be helpful in picture completion tasks. In this chapter, we will discuss the underlying GAN architecture and how they can be used used for image completion tasks.

**Title:** Exploring Annotation-free Image Captioning with Retrieval-augmented  Pseudo Sentence Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14750  
**Abstract:** Training an image captioner without annotated image-sentence pairs has gained traction in recent years. Previous approaches can be categorized into two strategies: crawling sentences from mismatching corpora and aligning them with the given images as pseudo annotations, or pre-training the captioner using external image-text pairs. However, the aligning setting seems to reach its performance limit due to the quality problem of pairs, and pre-training requires significant computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy ``LPM + retrieval-augmented learning" where the prior knowledge from large pre-trained models (LPMs) is leveraged as supervision, and a retrieval process is integrated to further reinforce its effectiveness. Specifically, we introduce Retrieval-augmented Pseudo Sentence Generation (RaPSG), which adopts an efficient approach to retrieve highly relevant short region descriptions from the mismatching corpora and use them to generate a variety of pseudo sentences with distinct representations as well as high quality via LPMs. In addition, a fluency filter and a CLIP-guided training objective are further introduced to facilitate model optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA pre-training model (Flamingo3B) by achieving a CIDEr score of 78.1 (+5.1) while utilizing only 0.3% of its trainable parameters (1.3B VS 33M). Importantly, our approach eliminates the need of computationally expensive pre-training processes on external datasets (e.g., the requirement of 312M image-text pairs for Flamingo3B). We further show that with a simple extension, the generated pseudo sentences can be deployed as weak supervision to boost the 1% semi-supervised image caption benchmark up to 93.4 CIDEr score (+8.9) which showcases the versatility and effectiveness of our approach.

**Title:** Gloss-free Sign Language Translation: Improving from Visual-Language  Pretraining  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14768  
**Abstract:** Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task due to its cross-domain nature, involving the translation of visual-gestural language to text. Many previous methods employ an intermediate representation, i.e., gloss sequences, to facilitate SLT, thus transforming it into a two-stage task of sign language recognition (SLR) followed by sign language translation (SLT). However, the scarcity of gloss-annotated sign language data, combined with the information bottleneck in the mid-level gloss representation, has hindered the further development of the SLT task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Gloss-Free SLT based on Visual-Language Pretraining (GFSLT-VLP), which improves SLT by inheriting language-oriented prior knowledge from pre-trained models, without any gloss annotation assistance. Our approach involves two stages: (i) integrating Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with masked self-supervised learning to create pre-tasks that bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual representations and restore masked sentences, and (ii) constructing an end-to-end architecture with an encoder-decoder-like structure that inherits the parameters of the pre-trained Visual Encoder and Text Decoder from the first stage. The seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust sign language representation and significantly improves gloss-free sign language translation. In particular, we have achieved unprecedented improvements in terms of BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX14T dataset (>+5) and the CSL-Daily dataset (>+3) compared to state-of-the-art gloss-free SLT methods. Furthermore, our approach also achieves competitive results on the PHOENIX14T dataset when compared with most of the gloss-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoubenjia/GFSLT-VLP.

**Title:** pCTFusion: Point Convolution-Transformer Fusion with Semantic Aware Loss  for Outdoor LiDAR Point Cloud Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14777  
**Abstract:** LiDAR-generated point clouds are crucial for perceiving outdoor environments. The segmentation of point clouds is also essential for many applications. Previous research has focused on using self-attention and convolution (local attention) mechanisms individually in semantic segmentation architectures. However, there is limited work on combining the learned representations of these attention mechanisms to improve performance. Additionally, existing research that combines convolution with self-attention relies on global attention, which is not practical for processing large point clouds. To address these challenges, this study proposes a new architecture, pCTFusion, which combines kernel-based convolutions and self-attention mechanisms for better feature learning and capturing local and global dependencies in segmentation. The proposed architecture employs two types of self-attention mechanisms, local and global, based on the hierarchical positions of the encoder blocks. Furthermore, the existing loss functions do not consider the semantic and position-wise importance of the points, resulting in reduced accuracy, particularly at sharp class boundaries. To overcome this, the study models a novel attention-based loss function called Pointwise Geometric Anisotropy (PGA), which assigns weights based on the semantic distribution of points in a neighborhood. The proposed architecture is evaluated on SemanticKITTI outdoor dataset and showed a 5-7% improvement in performance compared to the state-of-the-art architectures. The results are particularly encouraging for minor classes, often misclassified due to class imbalance, lack of space, and neighbor-aware feature encoding. These developed methods can be leveraged for the segmentation of complex datasets and can drive real-world applications of LiDAR point cloud.

**Title:** Improving Aspect-Based Sentiment with End-to-End Semantic Role Labeling  Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14785  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a series of approaches aimed at enhancing the performance of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) by utilizing extracted semantic information from a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) model. We propose a novel end-to-end Semantic Role Labeling model that effectively captures most of the structured semantic information within the Transformer hidden state. We believe that this end-to-end model is well-suited for our newly proposed models that incorporate semantic information. We evaluate the proposed models in two languages, English and Czech, employing ELECTRA-small models. Our combined models improve ABSA performance in both languages. Moreover, we achieved new state-of-the-art results on the Czech ABSA.

**Title:** Likely, Light, and Accurate Context-Free Clusters-based Trajectory  Prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14788  
**Abstract:** Autonomous systems in the road transportation network require intelligent mechanisms that cope with uncertainty to foresee the future. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage probabilistic approach for trajectory forecasting: trajectory transformation to displacement space, clustering of displacement time series, trajectory proposals, and ranking proposals. We introduce a new deep feature clustering method, underlying self-conditioned GAN, which copes better with distribution shifts than traditional methods. Additionally, we propose novel distance-based ranking proposals to assign probabilities to the generated trajectories that are more efficient yet accurate than an auxiliary neural network. The overall system surpasses context-free deep generative models in human and road agents trajectory data while performing similarly to point estimators when comparing the most probable trajectory.

**Title:** IML-ViT: Image Manipulation Localization by Vision Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14863  
**Abstract:** Advanced image tampering techniques are increasingly challenging the trustworthiness of multimedia, leading to the development of Image Manipulation Localization (IML). But what makes a good IML model? The answer lies in the way to capture artifacts. Exploiting artifacts requires the model to extract non-semantic discrepancies between the manipulated and authentic regions, which needs to compare differences between these two areas explicitly. With the self-attention mechanism, naturally, the Transformer is the best candidate. Besides, artifacts are sensitive to image resolution, amplified under multi-scale features, and massive at the manipulation border. Therefore, we formulate the answer to the former question as building a ViT with high-resolution capacity, multi-scale feature extraction capability, and manipulation edge supervision. We term this simple but effective ViT paradigm as the IML-ViT, which has great potential to become a new benchmark for IML. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets verified our model outperforms the state-of-the-art manipulation localization methods.

**Title:** Scaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations using Optimized  Negative Sampling and Loss Functions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14906  
**Abstract:** This work introduces TRON, a scalable session-based Transformer Recommender using Optimized Negative-sampling. Motivated by the scalability and performance limitations of prevailing models such as SASRec and GRU4Rec+, TRON integrates top-k negative sampling and listwise loss functions to enhance its recommendation accuracy. Evaluations on relevant large-scale e-commerce datasets show that TRON improves upon the recommendation quality of current methods while maintaining training speeds similar to SASRec. A live A/B test yielded an 18.14% increase in click-through rate over SASRec, highlighting the potential of TRON in practical settings. For further research, we provide access to our source code at https://github.com/otto-de/TRON and an anonymized dataset at https://github.com/otto-de/recsys-dataset.

**Title:** ARC-NLP at PAN 2023: Hierarchical Long Text Classification for Trigger  Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14912  
**Abstract:** Fanfiction, a popular form of creative writing set within established fictional universes, has gained a substantial online following. However, ensuring the well-being and safety of participants has become a critical concern in this community. The detection of triggering content, material that may cause emotional distress or trauma to readers, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we describe our approach for the Trigger Detection shared task at PAN CLEF 2023, where we want to detect multiple triggering content in a given Fanfiction document. For this, we build a hierarchical model that uses recurrence over Transformer-based language models. In our approach, we first split long documents into smaller sized segments and use them to fine-tune a Transformer model. Then, we extract feature embeddings from the fine-tuned Transformer model, which are used as input in the training of multiple LSTM models for trigger detection in a multi-label setting. Our model achieves an F1-macro score of 0.372 and F1-micro score of 0.736 on the validation set, which are higher than the baseline results shared at PAN CLEF 2023.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14913  
**Abstract:** The task of multi-author writing style detection aims at finding any positions of writing style change in a given text document. We formulate the task as a natural language inference problem where two consecutive paragraphs are paired. Our approach focuses on transitions between paragraphs while truncating input tokens for the task. As backbone models, we employ different Transformer-based encoders with warmup phase during training. We submit the model version that outperforms baselines and other proposed model versions in our experiments. For the easy and medium setups, we submit transition-focused natural language inference based on DeBERTa with warmup training, and the same model without transition for the hard setup.

**Title:** NSA: Naturalistic Support Artifact to Boost Network Confidence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14917  
**Abstract:** Visual AI systems are vulnerable to natural and synthetic physical corruption in the real-world. Such corruption often arises unexpectedly and alters the model's performance. In recent years, the primary focus has been on adversarial attacks. However, natural corruptions (e.g., snow, fog, dust) are an omnipresent threat to visual AI systems and should be considered equally important. Many existing works propose interesting solutions to train robust models against natural corruption. These works either leverage image augmentations, which come with the additional cost of model training, or place suspicious patches in the scene to design unadversarial examples. In this work, we propose the idea of naturalistic support artifacts (NSA) for robust prediction. The NSAs are shown to be beneficial in scenarios where model parameters are inaccessible and adding artifacts in the scene is feasible. The NSAs are natural looking objects generated through artifact training using DC-GAN to have high visual fidelity in the scene. We test against natural corruptions on the Imagenette dataset and observe the improvement in prediction confidence score by four times. We also demonstrate NSA's capability to increase adversarial accuracy by 8\% on average. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze NSAs using saliency maps to understand how they help improve prediction confidence.

**Title:** Take-A-Photo: 3D-to-2D Generative Pre-training of Point Cloud Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14971  
**Abstract:** With the overwhelming trend of mask image modeling led by MAE, generative pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have restricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme. Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud. Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also effective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN classification and ShapeNetPart segmentation tasks.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are now highly capable at a diverse range of tasks. This paper studies whether or not GPT-4, one such LLM, is capable of assisting researchers in the field of adversarial machine learning. As a case study, we evaluate the robustness of AI-Guardian, a recent defense to adversarial examples published at IEEE S&P 2023, a top computer security conference. We completely break this defense: the proposed scheme does not increase robustness compared to an undefended baseline.

**Title:** How Good is Google Bard's Visual Understanding? An Empirical Study on  Open Challenges  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15016  
**Abstract:** Google's Bard has emerged as a formidable competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT in the field of conversational AI. Notably, Bard has recently been updated to handle visual inputs alongside text prompts during conversations. Given Bard's impressive track record in handling textual inputs, we explore its capabilities in understanding and interpreting visual data (images) conditioned by text questions. This exploration holds the potential to unveil new insights and challenges for Bard and other forthcoming multi-modal Generative models, especially in addressing complex computer vision problems that demand accurate visual and language understanding. Specifically, in this study, we focus on 15 diverse task scenarios encompassing regular, camouflaged, medical, under-water and remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate Bard's performance. Our primary finding indicates that Bard still struggles in these vision scenarios, highlighting the significant gap in vision-based understanding that needs to be bridged in future developments. We expect that this empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, leading to enhanced capabilities in comprehending and interpreting fine-grained visual data.

**Title:** Self-Supervised Graph Transformer for Deepfake Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15019  
**Abstract:** Deepfake detection methods have shown promising results in recognizing forgeries within a given dataset, where training and testing take place on the in-distribution dataset. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when presented with unseen samples. As a result, a reliable deepfake detection system must remain impartial to forgery types, appearance, and quality for guaranteed generalizable detection performance. Despite various attempts to enhance cross-dataset generalization, the problem remains challenging, particularly when testing against common post-processing perturbations, such as video compression or blur. Hence, this study introduces a deepfake detection framework, leveraging a self-supervised pre-training model that delivers exceptional generalization ability, withstanding common corruptions and enabling feature explainability. The framework comprises three key components: a feature extractor based on vision Transformer architecture that is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning methodology, a graph convolution network coupled with a Transformer discriminator, and a graph Transformer relevancy map that provides a better understanding of manipulated regions and further explains the model's decision. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, several challenging experiments are conducted, including in-data distribution performance, cross-dataset, cross-manipulation generalization, and robustness against common post-production perturbations. The results achieved demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed deepfake detection framework, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approaches.

**Title:** SuperCLUE: A Comprehensive Chinese Large Language Model Benchmark  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15020  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to be integrated into human daily lives. Therefore, user preference is the most critical criterion for assessing LLMs' performance in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on measuring models' accuracy using multi-choice questions, which limits the understanding of their capabilities in real applications. We fill this gap by proposing a comprehensive Chinese benchmark SuperCLUE, named after another popular Chinese LLM benchmark CLUE. SuperCLUE encompasses three sub-tasks: actual users' queries and ratings derived from an LLM battle platform (CArena), open-ended questions with single and multiple-turn dialogues (OPEN), and closed-ended questions with the same stems as open-ended single-turn ones (CLOSE). Our study shows that accuracy on closed-ended questions is insufficient to reflect human preferences achieved on open-ended ones. At the same time, they can complement each other to predict actual user preferences. We also demonstrate that GPT-4 is a reliable judge to automatically evaluate human preferences on open-ended questions in a Chinese context. Our benchmark will be released at https://www.CLUEbenchmarks.com

**Title:** Diverse Inpainting and Editing with GAN Inversion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15033  
**Abstract:** Recent inversion methods have shown that real images can be inverted into StyleGAN's latent space and numerous edits can be achieved on those images thanks to the semantically rich feature representations of well-trained GAN models. However, extensive research has also shown that image inversion is challenging due to the trade-off between high-fidelity reconstruction and editability. In this paper, we tackle an even more difficult task, inverting erased images into GAN's latent space for realistic inpaintings and editings. Furthermore, by augmenting inverted latent codes with different latent samples, we achieve diverse inpaintings. Specifically, we propose to learn an encoder and mixing network to combine encoded features from erased images with StyleGAN's mapped features from random samples. To encourage the mixing network to utilize both inputs, we train the networks with generated data via a novel set-up. We also utilize higher-rate features to prevent color inconsistencies between the inpainted and unerased parts. We run extensive experiments and compare our method with state-of-the-art inversion and inpainting methods. Qualitative metrics and visual comparisons show significant improvements.

**Title:** TEDi: Temporally-Entangled Diffusion for Long-Term Motion Synthesis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15042  
**Abstract:** The gradual nature of a diffusion process that synthesizes samples in small increments constitutes a key ingredient of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which have presented unprecedented quality in image synthesis and been recently explored in the motion domain. In this work, we propose to adapt the gradual diffusion concept (operating along a diffusion time-axis) into the temporal-axis of the motion sequence. Our key idea is to extend the DDPM framework to support temporally varying denoising, thereby entangling the two axes. Using our special formulation, we iteratively denoise a motion buffer that contains a set of increasingly-noised poses, which auto-regressively produces an arbitrarily long stream of frames. With a stationary diffusion time-axis, in each diffusion step we increment only the temporal-axis of the motion such that the framework produces a new, clean frame which is removed from the beginning of the buffer, followed by a newly drawn noise vector that is appended to it. This new mechanism paves the way towards a new framework for long-term motion synthesis with applications to character animation and other domains.

**Title:** A Transformer-based Approach for Arabic Offline Handwritten Text  Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15045  
**Abstract:** Handwriting recognition is a challenging and critical problem in the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning a wide range of domains. In this paper, we focus on the specific issue of recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text. Existing approaches typically utilize a combination of convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal modeling, with connectionist temporal classification used for text generation. However, these methods suffer from a lack of parallelization due to the sequential nature of recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, these models cannot account for linguistic rules, necessitating the use of an external language model in the post-processing stage to boost accuracy. To overcome these issues, we introduce two alternative architectures, namely the Transformer Transducer and the standard sequence-to-sequence Transformer, and compare their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Our approach can model language dependencies and relies only on the attention mechanism, thereby making it more parallelizable and less complex. We employ pre-trained Transformers for both image understanding and language modeling. Our evaluation on the Arabic KHATT dataset demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches for recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text.

**Title:** Regularized Mask Tuning: Uncovering Hidden Knowledge in Pre-trained  Vision-Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15049  
**Abstract:** Prompt tuning and adapter tuning have shown great potential in transferring pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. In this work, we design a new type of tuning method, termed as regularized mask tuning, which masks the network parameters through a learnable selection. Inspired by neural pathways, we argue that the knowledge required by a downstream task already exists in the pre-trained weights but just gets concealed in the upstream pre-training stage. To bring the useful knowledge back into light, we first identify a set of parameters that are important to a given downstream task, then attach a binary mask to each parameter, and finally optimize these masks on the downstream data with the parameters frozen. When updating the mask, we introduce a novel gradient dropout strategy to regularize the parameter selection, in order to prevent the model from forgetting old knowledge and overfitting the downstream data. Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method over previous alternatives. It is noteworthy that we manage to deliver 18.73% performance improvement compared to the zero-shot CLIP via masking an average of only 2.56% parameters. Furthermore, our method is synergistic with most existing parameter-efficient tuning methods and can boost the performance on top of them.

**Title:** MARS: An Instance-aware, Modular and Realistic Simulator for Autonomous  Driving  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15058  
**Abstract:** Nowadays, autonomous cars can drive smoothly in ordinary cases, and it is widely recognized that realistic sensor simulation will play a critical role in solving remaining corner cases by simulating them. To this end, we propose an autonomous driving simulator based upon neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Compared with existing works, ours has three notable features: (1) Instance-aware. Our simulator models the foreground instances and background environments separately with independent networks so that the static (e.g., size and appearance) and dynamic (e.g., trajectory) properties of instances can be controlled separately. (2) Modular. Our simulator allows flexible switching between different modern NeRF-related backbones, sampling strategies, input modalities, etc. We expect this modular design to boost academic progress and industrial deployment of NeRF-based autonomous driving simulation. (3) Realistic. Our simulator set new state-of-the-art photo-realism results given the best module selection. Our simulator will be open-sourced while most of our counterparts are not.

**Title:** The RoboDepth Challenge: Methods and Advancements Towards Robust Depth  Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15061  
**Abstract:** Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications. Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website.

**Title:** Self-Supervised Visual Acoustic Matching  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15064  
**Abstract:** Acoustic matching aims to re-synthesize an audio clip to sound as if it were recorded in a target acoustic environment. Existing methods assume access to paired training data, where the audio is observed in both source and target environments, but this limits the diversity of training data or requires the use of simulated data or heuristics to create paired samples. We propose a self-supervised approach to visual acoustic matching where training samples include only the target scene image and audio -- without acoustically mismatched source audio for reference. Our approach jointly learns to disentangle room acoustics and re-synthesize audio into the target environment, via a conditional GAN framework and a novel metric that quantifies the level of residual acoustic information in the de-biased audio. Training with either in-the-wild web data or simulated data, we demonstrate it outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple challenging datasets and a wide variety of real-world audio and environments.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14361  
**Abstract:** This study presents an ensemble model combining LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU, and GloVe to classify gene mutations using Kaggle's Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment dataset. The results were compared against well-known transformers like as BERT, Electra, Roberta, XLNet, Distilbert, and their LSTM ensembles. Our model outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Mean Squared Error. Surprisingly, it also needed less training time, resulting in a perfect combination of performance and efficiency. This study demonstrates the utility of ensemble models for difficult tasks such as gene mutation classification.

**Title:** Diff-E: Diffusion-based Learning for Decoding Imagined Speech EEG  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14389  
**Abstract:** Decoding EEG signals for imagined speech is a challenging task due to the high-dimensional nature of the data and low signal-to-noise ratio. In recent years, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have emerged as promising approaches for representation learning in various domains. Our study proposes a novel method for decoding EEG signals for imagined speech using DDPMs and a conditional autoencoder named Diff-E. Results indicate that Diff-E significantly improves the accuracy of decoding EEG signals for imagined speech compared to traditional machine learning techniques and baseline models. Our findings suggest that DDPMs can be an effective tool for EEG signal decoding, with potential implications for the development of brain-computer interfaces that enable communication through imagined speech.

**Title:** A quantum ticking self-oscillator using delayed feedback  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14567  
**Abstract:** Self-sustained oscillators (SSOs) is a commonly used method to generate classical clock signals and SSOs using delayed feedback have been developed commercially which possess ultra-low phase noise and drift. Research into the development of quantum self-oscillation, where one can also have a periodic and regular output {\em tick}, that can be used to control quantum and classical devices has received much interest and quantum SSOs so far studied suffer from phase diffusion which leads to the smearing out of the quantum oscillator over the entire limit cycle in phase space seriously degrading the system's ability to perform as a self-oscillation. In this paper, we explore quantum versions of time-delayed SSOs, which has the potentials to develop a ticking quantum clock. We first design a linear quantum SSO which exhibits perfect oscillation without phase diffusion. We then explore a nonlinear delayed quantum SSO but find it exhibits dephasing similar to previously studied non-delayed systems.

**Title:** MCPA: Multi-scale Cross Perceptron Attention Network for 2D Medical  Image Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14588  
**Abstract:** The UNet architecture, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has demonstrated its remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, it faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to the limited receptive fields and inherent bias of convolutional operations. Recently, numerous transformer-based techniques have been incorporated into the UNet architecture to overcome this limitation by effectively capturing global feature correlations. However, the integration of the Transformer modules may result in the loss of local contextual information during the global feature fusion process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a 2D medical image segmentation model called Multi-scale Cross Perceptron Attention Network (MCPA). The MCPA consists of three main components: an encoder, a decoder, and a Cross Perceptron. The Cross Perceptron first captures the local correlations using multiple Multi-scale Cross Perceptron modules, facilitating the fusion of features across scales. The resulting multi-scale feature vectors are then spatially unfolded, concatenated, and fed through a Global Perceptron module to model global dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a Progressive Dual-branch Structure to address the semantic segmentation of the image involving finer tissue structures. This structure gradually shifts the segmentation focus of MCPA network training from large-scale structural features to more sophisticated pixel-level features. We evaluate our proposed MCPA model on several publicly available medical image datasets from different tasks and devices, including the open large-scale dataset of CT (Synapse), MRI (ACDC), fundus camera (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, HRF), and OCTA (ROSE). The experimental results show that our MCPA model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/simonustc/MCPA-for-2D-Medical-Image-Segmentation.
