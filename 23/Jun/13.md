**Title:** Surrogate Modeling of Car Drag Coefficient with Depth and Normal  Renderings  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06110  
**Abstract:** Generative AI models have made significant progress in automating the creation of 3D shapes, which has the potential to transform car design. In engineering design and optimization, evaluating engineering metrics is crucial. To make generative models performance-aware and enable them to create high-performing designs, surrogate modeling of these metrics is necessary. However, the currently used representations of three-dimensional (3D) shapes either require extensive computational resources to learn or suffer from significant information loss, which impairs their effectiveness in surrogate modeling. To address this issue, we propose a new two-dimensional (2D) representation of 3D shapes. We develop a surrogate drag model based on this representation to verify its effectiveness in predicting 3D car drag. We construct a diverse dataset of 9,070 high-quality 3D car meshes labeled by drag coefficients computed from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to train our model. Our experiments demonstrate that our model can accurately and efficiently evaluate drag coefficients with an $R^2$ value above 0.84 for various car categories. Moreover, the proposed representation method can be generalized to many other product categories beyond cars. Our model is implemented using deep neural networks, making it compatible with recent AI image generation tools (such as Stable Diffusion) and a significant step towards the automatic generation of drag-optimized car designs. We have made the dataset and code publicly available at https://decode.mit.edu/projects/dragprediction/.

**Title:** Joint Channel Estimation and Feedback with Masked Token Transformers in  Massive MIMO Systems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06125  
**Abstract:** When the base station has downlink channel status information (CSI), the huge potential of large-scale multiple input multiple output (MIMO) in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode can be fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based joint channel estimation and feedback framework to realize channel estimation and feedback in massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we use traditional channel design rather than end-to-end methods. Our model contains two networks. The first network is a channel estimation network, which adopts a double loss design, and can accurately estimate the full channel information while removing channel noises. The second network is a compression and feedback network. Inspired by the masked token transformer, we propose a learnable mask token method to obtain excellent estimation and compression performance. The extensive simulation results and ablation studies show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art channel estimation and feedback methods in both separate and joint tasks.

**Title:** Deep Learning Method for Object Tracking, Velocity Estimation and  Projection of Sensor Data over Time  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06126  
**Abstract:** Current Deep Learning methods for environment segmentation and velocity estimation rely on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks to exploit spatio-temporal relationships within obtained sensor data. These approaches derive scene dynamics implicitly by correlating novel input and memorized data utilizing ConvNets. We show how ConvNets suffer from architectural restrictions for this task. Based on these findings, we then provide solutions to various issues on exploiting spatio-temporal correlations in a sequence of sensor recordings by presenting a novel Recurrent Neural Network unit utilizing Transformer mechanisms. Within this unit, object encodings are tracked across consecutive frames by correlating key-query pairs derived from sensor inputs and memory states, respectively. We then use resulting tracking patterns to obtain scene dynamics and regress velocities. In a last step, the memory state of the Recurrent Neural Network is projected based on extracted velocity estimates to resolve aforementioned spatio-temporal misalignment.

**Title:** Towards Understanding the Interplay of Generative Artificial  Intelligence and the Internet  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06130  
**Abstract:** The rapid adoption of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can generate realistic images or text, such as DALL-E, MidJourney, or ChatGPT, have put the societal impacts of these technologies at the center of public debate. These tools are possible due to the massive amount of data (text and images) that is publicly available through the Internet. At the same time, these generative AI tools become content creators that are already contributing to the data that is available to train future models. Therefore, future versions of generative AI tools will be trained with a mix of human-created and AI-generated content, causing a potential feedback loop between generative AI and public data repositories. This interaction raises many questions: how will future versions of generative AI tools behave when trained on a mixture of real and AI generated data? Will they evolve and improve with the new data sets or on the contrary will they degrade? Will evolution introduce biases or reduce diversity in subsequent generations of generative AI tools? What are the societal implications of the possible degradation of these models? Can we mitigate the effects of this feedback loop? In this document, we explore the effect of this interaction and report some initial results using simple diffusion models trained with various image datasets. Our results show that the quality and diversity of the generated images can degrade over time suggesting that incorporating AI-created data can have undesired effects on future versions of generative models.

**Title:** $FPDM$: Domain-Specific Fast Pre-training Technique using Document-Level  Metadata  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06190  
**Abstract:** Pre-training Transformers has shown promising results on open-domain and domain-specific downstream tasks. However, state-of-the-art Transformers require an unreasonably large amount of pre-training data and compute. In this paper, we propose $FPDM$ (Fast Pre-training Technique using Document Level Metadata), a novel, compute-efficient framework that utilizes Document metadata and Domain-Specific Taxonomy as supervision signals to pre-train transformer encoder on a domain-specific corpus. The main innovation is that during domain-specific pretraining, an open-domain encoder is continually pre-trained using sentence-level embeddings as inputs (to accommodate long documents), however, fine-tuning is done with token-level embeddings as inputs to this encoder. We show that $FPDM$ outperforms several transformer-based baselines in terms of character-level F1 scores and other automated metrics in the Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal Domains, and shows a negligible drop in performance on open-domain benchmarks. Importantly, the novel use of document-level supervision along with sentence-level embedding input for pre-training reduces pre-training compute by around $1,000$, $4,500$, and $500$ times compared to MLM and/or NSP in Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal Domains, respectively. Code and datasets are available at https://bit.ly/FPDMCode.

**Title:** Reliability Check: An Analysis of GPT-3's Response to Sensitive Topics  and Prompt Wording  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06199  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become mainstream technology with their versatile use cases and impressive performance. Despite the countless out-of-the-box applications, LLMs are still not reliable. A lot of work is being done to improve the factual accuracy, consistency, and ethical standards of these models through fine-tuning, prompting, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), but no systematic analysis of the responses of these models to different categories of statements, or on their potential vulnerabilities to simple prompting changes is available. In this work, we analyze what confuses GPT-3: how the model responds to certain sensitive topics and what effects the prompt wording has on the model response. We find that GPT-3 correctly disagrees with obvious Conspiracies and Stereotypes but makes mistakes with common Misconceptions and Controversies. The model responses are inconsistent across prompts and settings, highlighting GPT-3's unreliability. Dataset and code of our analysis is available in https://github.com/tanny411/GPT3-Reliability-Check.

**Title:** FLSL: Feature-level Self-supervised Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06203  
**Abstract:** Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (e.g., SimCLR, DINO, VICReg, MOCOv3) target primarily on representations at instance level and do not generalize well to dense prediction tasks, such as object detection and segmentation. Towards aligning SSL with dense predictions, this paper demonstrates for the first time the underlying mean-shift clustering process of Vision Transformers (ViT), which aligns well with natural image semantics (e.g., a world of objects and stuffs). By employing transformer for joint embedding and clustering, we propose a two-level feature clustering SSL method, coined Feature-Level Self-supervised Learning (FLSL). We present the formal definition of the FLSL problem and construct the objectives from the mean-shift and k-means perspectives. We show that FLSL promotes remarkable semantic cluster representations and learns an embedding scheme amenable to intra-view and inter-view feature clustering. Experiments show that FLSL yields significant improvements in dense prediction tasks, achieving 44.9 (+2.8)% AP and 46.5% AP in object detection, as well as 40.8 (+2.3)% AP and 42.1% AP in instance segmentation on MS-COCO, using Mask R-CNN with ViT-S/16 and ViT-S/8 as backbone, respectively. FLSL consistently outperforms existing SSL methods across additional benchmarks, including UAV object detection on UAVDT, and video instance segmentation on DAVIS 2017. We conclude by presenting visualization and various ablation studies to better 20 understand the success of FLSL.

**Title:** Morphosyntactic probing of multilingual BERT models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06205  
**Abstract:** We introduce an extensive dataset for multilingual probing of morphological information in language models (247 tasks across 42 languages from 10 families), each consisting of a sentence with a target word and a morphological tag as the desired label, derived from the Universal Dependencies treebanks. We find that pre-trained Transformer models (mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa) learn features that attain strong performance across these tasks. We then apply two methods to locate, for each probing task, where the disambiguating information resides in the input. The first is a new perturbation method that masks various parts of context; the second is the classical method of Shapley values. The most intriguing finding that emerges is a strong tendency for the preceding context to hold more information relevant to the prediction than the following context.

**Title:** A Survey on Segment Anything Model (SAM): Vision Foundation Model Meets  Prompt Engineering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06211  
**Abstract:** Segment anything model (SAM) developed by Meta AI Research has recently attracted significant attention. Trained on a large segmentation dataset of over 1 billion masks, SAM is capable of segmenting any object on a certain image. In the original SAM work, the authors turned to zero-short transfer tasks (like edge detection) for evaluating the performance of SAM. Recently, numerous works have attempted to investigate the performance of SAM in various scenarios to recognize and segment objects. Moreover, numerous projects have emerged to show the versatility of SAM as a foundation model by combining it with other models, like Grounding DINO, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc. With the relevant papers and projects increasing exponentially, it is challenging for the readers to catch up with the development of SAM. To this end, this work conducts the first yet comprehensive survey on SAM. This is an ongoing project and we intend to update the manuscript on a regular basis. Therefore, readers are welcome to contact us if they complete new works related to SAM so that we can include them in our next version.

**Title:** Aladdin: Zero-Shot Hallucination of Stylized 3D Assets from Abstract  Scene Descriptions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06212  
**Abstract:** What constitutes the "vibe" of a particular scene? What should one find in "a busy, dirty city street", "an idyllic countryside", or "a crime scene in an abandoned living room"? The translation from abstract scene descriptions to stylized scene elements cannot be done with any generality by extant systems trained on rigid and limited indoor datasets. In this paper, we propose to leverage the knowledge captured by foundation models to accomplish this translation. We present a system that can serve as a tool to generate stylized assets for 3D scenes described by a short phrase, without the need to enumerate the objects to be found within the scene or give instructions on their appearance. Additionally, it is robust to open-world concepts in a way that traditional methods trained on limited data are not, affording more creative freedom to the 3D artist. Our system demonstrates this using a foundation model "team" composed of a large language model, a vision-language model and several image diffusion models, which communicate using an interpretable and user-editable intermediate representation, thus allowing for more versatile and controllable stylized asset generation for 3D artists. We introduce novel metrics for this task, and show through human evaluations that in 91% of the cases, our system outputs are judged more faithful to the semantics of the input scene description than the baseline, thus highlighting the potential of this approach to radically accelerate the 3D content creation process for 3D artists.

**Title:** Boosting GUI Prototyping with Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06233  
**Abstract:** GUI (graphical user interface) prototyping is a widely-used technique in requirements engineering for gathering and refining requirements, reducing development risks and increasing stakeholder engagement. However, GUI prototyping can be a time-consuming and costly process. In recent years, deep learning models such as Stable Diffusion have emerged as a powerful text-to-image tool capable of generating detailed images based on text prompts. In this paper, we propose UI-Diffuser, an approach that leverages Stable Diffusion to generate mobile UIs through simple textual descriptions and UI components. Preliminary results show that UI-Diffuser provides an efficient and cost-effective way to generate mobile GUI designs while reducing the need for extensive prototyping efforts. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the speed and efficiency of GUI prototyping in requirements engineering.

**Title:** Attention-stacked Generative Adversarial Network (AS-GAN)-empowered  Sensor Data Augmentation for Online Monitoring of Manufacturing System  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06268  
**Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) has been extensively adopted for the online sensing-based monitoring in advanced manufacturing systems. However, the sensor data collected under abnormal states are usually insufficient, leading to significant data imbalanced issue for supervised machine learning. A common solution for this issue is to incorporate data augmentation technique, i.e., augmenting the available abnormal states data (i.e., minority samples) via synthetic generation. To generate the high-quality minority samples effectively, it is vital to learn the underlying distribution of the abnormal states data. In recent years, the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approaches become popular to learn data distribution as well as perform data augmentation. However, in practice, the quality of generated samples from GAN-based data augmentation may vary drastically. In addition, the sensor signals are collected sequentially by time from the manufacturing systems, which means the consideration of sequential information is also very important in data augmentation. To address these limitations, inspired by the multi-head attention mechanism, this paper proposed an attention-stacked GAN (AS-GAN) architecture for the sensor data augmentation of online monitoring in advanced manufacturing. In this proposed AS-GAN, a new attention-stacked framework is incorporated to strengthen the generator in GAN with the learning capability of considering sequential information. Furthermore, the developed attention-stacked framework also greatly helps to improve the quality of generated sensor signals. The case studies conducted in additive manufacturing also successfully validate the effectiveness of AS-GAN to augment high-quality artificial multi-channel sensor signals for online monitoring of manufacturing systems.

**Title:** NERFBK: A High-Quality Benchmark for NERF-Based 3D Reconstruction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06300  
**Abstract:** This paper introduces a new real and synthetic dataset called NeRFBK specifically designed for testing and comparing NeRF-based 3D reconstruction algorithms. High-quality 3D reconstruction has significant potential in various fields, and advancements in image-based algorithms make it essential to evaluate new advanced techniques. However, gathering diverse data with precise ground truth is challenging and may not encompass all relevant applications. The NeRFBK dataset addresses this issue by providing multi-scale, indoor and outdoor datasets with high-resolution images and videos and camera parameters for testing and comparing NeRF-based algorithms. This paper presents the design and creation of the NeRFBK benchmark, various examples and application scenarios, and highlights its potential for advancing the field of 3D reconstruction.

**Title:** Towards Arabic Multimodal Dataset for Sentiment Analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06322  
**Abstract:** Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has recently become a centric research direction for many real-world applications. This proliferation is due to the fact that opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors. In addition, the recent deployment of Deep Learning-based (DL) models has proven their high efficiency for a wide range of Western languages. In contrast, Arabic DL-based multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is still in its infantile stage due, mainly, to the lack of standard datasets. In this paper, our investigation is twofold. First, we design a pipeline that helps building our Arabic Multimodal dataset leveraging both state-of-the-art transformers and feature extraction tools within word alignment techniques. Thereafter, we validate our dataset using state-of-the-art transformer-based model dealing with multimodality. Despite the small size of the outcome dataset, experiments show that Arabic multimodality is very promising

**Title:** Explaining a machine learning decision to physicians via counterfactuals  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06325  
**Abstract:** Machine learning models perform well on several healthcare tasks and can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system. However, the lack of explainability is a major roadblock to their adoption in hospitals. \textit{How can the decision of an ML model be explained to a physician?} The explanations considered in this paper are counterfactuals (CFs), hypothetical scenarios that would have resulted in the opposite outcome. Specifically, time-series CFs are investigated, inspired by the way physicians converse and reason out decisions `I would have given the patient a vasopressor if their blood pressure was lower and falling'. Key properties of CFs that are particularly meaningful in clinical settings are outlined: physiological plausibility, relevance to the task and sparse perturbations. Past work on CF generation does not satisfy these properties, specifically plausibility in that realistic time-series CFs are not generated. A variational autoencoder (VAE)-based approach is proposed that captures these desired properties. The method produces CFs that improve on prior approaches quantitatively (more plausible CFs as evaluated by their likelihood w.r.t original data distribution, and 100$\times$ faster at generating CFs) and qualitatively (2$\times$ more plausible and relevant) as evaluated by three physicians.

**Title:** Investigating the Effectiveness of ChatGPT in Mathematical Reasoning and  Problem Solving: Evidence from the Vietnamese National High School Graduation  Examination  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06331  
**Abstract:** This study offers a complete analysis of ChatGPT's mathematics abilities in responding to multiple-choice questions for the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination (VNHSGE) on a range of subjects and difficulty levels. The dataset included 250 questions divided into four levels: knowledge (K), comprehension (C), application (A), and high application (H), and it included ten themes that covered diverse mathematical concepts. The outcomes demonstrate that ChatGPT's performance varies depending on the difficulty level and subject. It performed best on questions at Level (K), with an accuracy rate of $83\%$; but, as the difficulty level rose, it scored poorly, with an accuracy rate of $10\%$. The study has also shown that ChatGPT significantly succeeds in providing responses to questions on subjects including exponential and logarithmic functions, geometric progression, and arithmetic progression. The study found that ChatGPT had difficulty correctly answering questions on topics including derivatives and applications, spatial geometry, and Oxyz spatial calculus. Additionally, this study contrasted ChatGPT outcomes with Vietnamese students in VNHSGE and in other math competitions. ChatGPT dominated in the SAT Math competition with a success rate of $70\%$, followed by VNHSGE mathematics ($58.8\%)$. However, its success rates were lower on other exams, such as AP Statistics, the GRE Quantitative, AMC 10, AMC 12, and AP Calculus BC. These results suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be an effective teaching tool for mathematics, but more work is needed to enhance its handling of graphical data and address the challenges presented by questions that are getting more challenging.

**Title:** How to Learn and Generalize From Three Minutes of Data:  Physics-Constrained and Uncertainty-Aware Neural Stochastic Differential  Equations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06335  
**Abstract:** We present a framework and algorithms to learn controlled dynamics models using neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) -- SDEs whose drift and diffusion terms are both parametrized by neural networks. We construct the drift term to leverage a priori physics knowledge as inductive bias, and we design the diffusion term to represent a distance-aware estimate of the uncertainty in the learned model's predictions -- it matches the system's underlying stochasticity when evaluated on states near those from the training dataset, and it predicts highly stochastic dynamics when evaluated on states beyond the training regime. The proposed neural SDEs can be evaluated quickly enough for use in model predictive control algorithms, or they can be used as simulators for model-based reinforcement learning. Furthermore, they make accurate predictions over long time horizons, even when trained on small datasets that cover limited regions of the state space. We demonstrate these capabilities through experiments on simulated robotic systems, as well as by using them to model and control a hexacopter's flight dynamics: A neural SDE trained using only three minutes of manually collected flight data results in a model-based control policy that accurately tracks aggressive trajectories that push the hexacopter's velocity and Euler angles to nearly double the maximum values observed in the training dataset.

**Title:** Language-Guided Traffic Simulation via Scene-Level Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06344  
**Abstract:** Realistic and controllable traffic simulation is a core capability that is necessary to accelerate autonomous vehicle (AV) development. However, current approaches for controlling learning-based traffic models require significant domain expertise and are difficult for practitioners to use. To remedy this, we present CTG++, a scene-level conditional diffusion model that can be guided by language instructions. Developing this requires tackling two challenges: the need for a realistic and controllable traffic model backbone, and an effective method to interface with a traffic model using language. To address these challenges, we first propose a scene-level diffusion model equipped with a spatio-temporal transformer backbone, which generates realistic and controllable traffic. We then harness a large language model (LLM) to convert a user's query into a loss function, guiding the diffusion model towards query-compliant generation. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating realistic, query-compliant traffic simulations.

**Title:** Improving Non-autoregressive Translation Quality with Pretrained  Language Model, Embedding Distillation and Upsampling Strategy for CTC  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06345  
**Abstract:** Non-autoregressive approaches aim to improve the inference speed of translation models, particularly those that generate output in a one-pass forward manner. However, these approaches often suffer from a significant drop in translation quality compared to autoregressive models. This paper introduces a series of innovative techniques to enhance the translation quality of Non-Autoregressive Translation (NAT) models while maintaining a substantial acceleration in inference speed. We propose fine-tuning Pretrained Multilingual Language Models (PMLMs) with the CTC loss to train NAT models effectively. Furthermore, we adopt the MASK insertion scheme for up-sampling instead of token duplication, and we present an embedding distillation method to further enhance performance. In our experiments, our model outperforms the baseline autoregressive model (Transformer \textit{base}) on multiple datasets, including WMT'14 DE$\leftrightarrow$EN, WMT'16 RO$\leftrightarrow$EN, and IWSLT'14 DE$\leftrightarrow$EN. Notably, our model achieves better performance than the baseline autoregressive model on the IWSLT'14 En$\leftrightarrow$De and WMT'16 En$\leftrightarrow$Ro datasets, even without using distillation data during training. It is worth highlighting that on the IWSLT'14 DE$\rightarrow$EN dataset, our model achieves an impressive BLEU score of 39.59, setting a new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our model exhibits a remarkable speed improvement of 16.35 times compared to the autoregressive model.

**Title:** EventCLIP: Adapting CLIP for Event-based Object Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06354  
**Abstract:** Recent advances in 2D zero-shot and few-shot recognition often leverage large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. Due to a shortage of suitable datasets, it is currently infeasible to train such models for event camera data. Thus, leveraging existing models across modalities is an important research challenge. In this work, we propose EventCLIP, a new method that utilizes CLIP for zero-shot and few-shot recognition on event camera data. First, we demonstrate the suitability of CLIP's image embeddings for zero-shot event classification by converting raw events to 2D grid-based representations. Second, we propose a feature adapter that aggregates temporal information over event frames and refines text embeddings to better align with the visual inputs. We evaluate our work on N-Caltech, N-Cars, and N-ImageNet datasets under the few-shot learning setting, where EventCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we show that the robustness of existing event-based classifiers against data variations can be further boosted by ensembling with EventCLIP.

**Title:** Shuffled Autoregression For Motion Interpolation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06367  
**Abstract:** This work aims to provide a deep-learning solution for the motion interpolation task. Previous studies solve it with geometric weight functions. Some other works propose neural networks for different problem settings with consecutive pose sequences as input. However, motion interpolation is a more complex problem that takes isolated poses (e.g., only one start pose and one end pose) as input. When applied to motion interpolation, these deep learning methods have limited performance since they do not leverage the flexible dependencies between interpolation frames as the original geometric formulas do. To realize this interpolation characteristic, we propose a novel framework, referred to as \emph{Shuffled AutoRegression}, which expands the autoregression to generate in arbitrary (shuffled) order and models any inter-frame dependencies as a directed acyclic graph. We further propose an approach to constructing a particular kind of dependency graph, with three stages assembled into an end-to-end spatial-temporal motion Transformer. Experimental results on one of the current largest datasets show that our model generates vivid and coherent motions from only one start frame to one end frame and outperforms competing methods by a large margin. The proposed model is also extensible to multiple keyframes' motion interpolation tasks and other areas' interpolation.

**Title:** A Comprehensive Review of State-of-The-Art Methods for Java Code  Generation from Natural Language Text  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06371  
**Abstract:** Java Code Generation consists in generating automatically Java code from a Natural Language Text. This NLP task helps in increasing programmers' productivity by providing them with immediate solutions to the simplest and most repetitive tasks. Code generation is a challenging task because of the hard syntactic rules and the necessity of a deep understanding of the semantic aspect of the programming language. Many works tried to tackle this task using either RNN-based, or Transformer-based models. The latter achieved remarkable advancement in the domain and they can be divided into three groups: (1) encoder-only models, (2) decoder-only models, and (3) encoder-decoder models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the evolution and progress of deep learning models in Java code generation task. We focus on the most important methods and present their merits and limitations, as well as the objective functions used by the community. In addition, we provide a detailed description of datasets and evaluation metrics used in the literature. Finally, we discuss results of different models on CONCODE dataset, then propose some future directions.

**Title:** From NeRFLiX to NeRFLiX++: A General NeRF-Agnostic Restorer Paradigm  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06388  
**Abstract:** Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown great success in novel view synthesis. However, recovering high-quality details from real-world scenes is still challenging for the existing NeRF-based approaches, due to the potential imperfect calibration information and scene representation inaccuracy. Even with high-quality training frames, the synthetic novel views produced by NeRF models still suffer from notable rendering artifacts, such as noise and blur. To address this, we propose NeRFLiX, a general NeRF-agnostic restorer paradigm that learns a degradation-driven inter-viewpoint mixer. Specially, we design a NeRF-style degradation modeling approach and construct large-scale training data, enabling the possibility of effectively removing NeRF-native rendering artifacts for deep neural networks. Moreover, beyond the degradation removal, we propose an inter-viewpoint aggregation framework that fuses highly related high-quality training images, pushing the performance of cutting-edge NeRF models to entirely new levels and producing highly photo-realistic synthetic views. Based on this paradigm, we further present NeRFLiX++ with a stronger two-stage NeRF degradation simulator and a faster inter-viewpoint mixer, achieving superior performance with significantly improved computational efficiency. Notably, NeRFLiX++ is capable of restoring photo-realistic ultra-high-resolution outputs from noisy low-resolution NeRF-rendered views. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent restoration ability of NeRFLiX++ on various novel view synthesis benchmarks.

**Title:** Image Vectorization: a Review  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06441  
**Abstract:** Nowadays, there are many diffusion and autoregressive models that show impressive results for generating images from text and other input domains. However, these methods are not intended for ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Vector graphics are devoid of this disadvantage, so the generation of images in this format looks very promising. Instead of generating vector images directly, you can first synthesize a raster image and then apply vectorization. Vectorization is the process of converting a raster image into a similar vector image using primitive shapes. Besides being similar, generated vector image is also required to contain the minimum number of shapes for rendering. In this paper, we focus specifically on machine learning-compatible vectorization methods. We are considering Mang2Vec, Deep Vectorization of Technical Drawings, DiffVG, and LIVE models. We also provide a brief overview of existing online methods. We also recall other algorithmic methods, Im2Vec and ClipGEN models, but they do not participate in the comparison, since there is no open implementation of these methods or their official implementations do not work correctly. Our research shows that despite the ability to directly specify the number and type of shapes, existing machine learning methods work for a very long time and do not accurately recreate the original image. We believe that there is no fast universal automatic approach and human control is required for every method.

**Title:** Enhancing Low Resource NER Using Assisting Language And Transfer  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06477  
**Abstract:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in NLP that is used to locate the key information in text and is primarily applied in conversational and search systems. In commercial applications, NER or comparable slot-filling methods have been widely deployed for popular languages. NER is used in applications such as human resources, customer service, search engines, content classification, and academia. In this paper, we draw focus on identifying name entities for low-resource Indian languages that are closely related, like Hindi and Marathi. We use various adaptations of BERT such as baseBERT, AlBERT, and RoBERTa to train a supervised NER model. We also compare multilingual models with monolingual models and establish a baseline. In this work, we show the assisting capabilities of the Hindi and Marathi languages for the NER task. We show that models trained using multiple languages perform better than a single language. However, we also observe that blind mixing of all datasets doesn't necessarily provide improvements and data selection methods may be required.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06494  
**Abstract:** With the availability of large-scale, comprehensive, and general-purpose vision-language (VL) datasets such as MSCOCO, vision-language pre-training (VLP) has become an active area of research and proven to be effective for various VL tasks such as visual-question answering. However, studies on VLP in the medical domain have so far been scanty. To provide a comprehensive perspective on VLP for medical VL tasks, we conduct a thorough experimental analysis to study key factors that may affect the performance of VLP with a unified vision-language Transformer. To allow making sound and quick pre-training decisions, we propose RadioGraphy Captions (RGC), a high-quality, multi-modality radiographic dataset containing 18,434 image-caption pairs collected from an open-access online database MedPix. RGC can be used as a pre-training dataset or a new benchmark for medical report generation and medical image-text retrieval. By utilizing RGC and other available datasets for pre-training, we develop several key insights that can guide future medical VLP research and new strong baselines for various medical VL tasks.

**Title:** Vista-Morph: Unsupervised Image Registration of Visible-Thermal Facial  Pairs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06505  
**Abstract:** For a variety of biometric cross-spectral tasks, Visible-Thermal (VT) facial pairs are used. However, due to a lack of calibration in the lab, photographic capture between two different sensors leads to severely misaligned pairs that can lead to poor results for person re-identification and generative AI. To solve this problem, we introduce our approach for VT image registration called Vista Morph. Unlike existing VT facial registration that requires manual, hand-crafted features for pixel matching and/or a supervised thermal reference, Vista Morph is completely unsupervised without the need for a reference. By learning the affine matrix through a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Vista Morph successfully aligns facial and non-facial VT images. Our approach learns warps in Hard, No, and Low-light visual settings and is robust to geometric perturbations and erasure at test time. We conduct a downstream generative AI task to show that registering training data with Vista Morph improves subject identity of generated thermal faces when performing V2T image translation.

**Title:** TS-MoCo: Time-Series Momentum Contrast for Self-Supervised Physiological  Representation Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06522  
**Abstract:** Limited availability of labeled physiological data often prohibits the use of powerful supervised deep learning models in the biomedical machine intelligence domain. We approach this problem and propose a novel encoding framework that relies on self-supervised learning with momentum contrast to learn representations from multivariate time-series of various physiological domains without needing labels. Our model uses a transformer architecture that can be easily adapted to classification problems by optimizing a linear output classification layer. We experimentally evaluate our framework using two publicly available physiological datasets from different domains, i.e., human activity recognition from embedded inertial sensory and emotion recognition from electroencephalography. We show that our self-supervised learning approach can indeed learn discriminative features which can be exploited in downstream classification tasks. Our work enables the development of domain-agnostic intelligent systems that can effectively analyze multivariate time-series data from physiological domains.

**Abstract:** We present a local-to-global perspective on graph neural networks (GNN), which are categorized as local Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and global Graph Transformer. We present three pieces of work: 1) study the convergence property of a type of global GNN, Invariant Graph Networks, 2) connect the local MPNN and global Graph Transformer, and 3) use local MPNN for graph coarsening, a common subroutine used in global modeling.

**Title:** Inductive reasoning in humans and large language models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06548  
**Abstract:** The impressive recent performance of large language models has led many to wonder to what extent they can serve as models of general intelligence or are similar to human cognition. We address this issue by applying GPT-3 and GPT-4 to a classic problem in human inductive reasoning known as property induction. Over two experiments, we elicit human judgments on a range of property induction tasks spanning multiple domains. Although GPT-3 struggles to capture many aspects of human behaviour, GPT-4 is much more successful: for the most part, its performance qualitatively matches that of humans, and the only notable exception is its failure to capture the phenomenon of premise non-monotonicity. Overall, this work not only demonstrates that property induction is an interesting skill on which to compare human and machine intelligence, but also provides two large datasets that can serve as suitable benchmarks for future work in this vein.

**Title:** Hinting Pipeline and Multivariate Regression CNN for Maize Kernel  Counting on the Ear  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06553  
**Abstract:** Maize is a highly nutritional cereal widely used for human and animal consumption and also as raw material by the biofuels industries. This highlights the importance of precisely quantifying the corn grain productivity in season, helping the commercialization process, operationalization, and critical decision-making. Considering the manual labor cost of counting maize kernels, we propose in this work a novel preprocessing pipeline named hinting that guides the attention of the model to the center of the corn kernels and enables a deep learning model to deliver better performance, given a picture of one side of the corn ear. Also, we propose a multivariate CNN regressor that outperforms single regression results. Experiments indicated that the proposed approach excels the current manual estimates, obtaining MAE of 34.4 and R2 of 0.74 against 35.38 and 0.72 for the manual estimate, respectively.

**Title:** Semantically-aware Mask CycleGAN for Translating Artistic Portraits to  Photo-realistic Visualizations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06577  
**Abstract:** Image-to-image translation (I2I) is defined as a computer vision task where the aim is to transfer images in a source domain to a target domain with minimal loss or alteration of the content representations. Major progress has been made since I2I was proposed with the invention of a variety of revolutionary generative models. Among them, GAN-based models perform exceptionally well as they are mostly tailor-made for specific domains or tasks. However, few works proposed a tailor-made method for the artistic domain. In this project, I propose the Semantic-aware Mask CycleGAN (SMCycleGAN) architecture which can translate artistic portraits to photo-realistic visualizations. This model can generate realistic human portraits by feeding the discriminators semantically masked fake samples, thus enforcing them to make discriminative decisions with partial information so that the generators can be optimized to synthesize more realistic human portraits instead of increasing the similarity of other irrelevant components, such as the background. Experiments have shown that the SMCycleGAN generate images with significantly increased realism and minimal loss of content representations.

**Title:** RoBERTweet: A BERT Language Model for Romanian Tweets  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06598  
**Abstract:** Developing natural language processing (NLP) systems for social media analysis remains an important topic in artificial intelligence research. This article introduces RoBERTweet, the first Transformer architecture trained on Romanian tweets. Our RoBERTweet comes in two versions, following the base and large architectures of BERT. The corpus used for pre-training the models represents a novelty for the Romanian NLP community and consists of all tweets collected from 2008 to 2022. Experiments show that RoBERTweet models outperform the previous general-domain Romanian and multilingual language models on three NLP tasks with tweet inputs: emotion detection, sexist language identification, and named entity recognition. We make our models and the newly created corpus of Romanian tweets freely available.

**Title:** Empowering Molecule Discovery for Molecule-Caption Translation with  Large Language Models: A ChatGPT Perspective  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06615  
**Abstract:** Molecule discovery plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, advancing the design of tailored materials and drugs. Traditional methods for molecule discovery follow a trial-and-error process, which are both time-consuming and costly, while computational approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as revolutionary tools to expedite various tasks, like molecule-caption translation. Despite the importance of molecule-caption translation for molecule discovery, most of the existing methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessive computational cost, and suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in various cross-modal tasks due to their great powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, generalization, and reasoning, which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. To address the above limitations, in this work, we propose a novel LLMs-based framework (\textbf{MolReGPT}) for molecule-caption translation, where a retrieval-based prompt paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery with LLMs like ChatGPT without fine-tuning. More specifically, MolReGPT leverages the principle of molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their text descriptions from a local database to ground the generation of LLMs through in-context few-shot molecule learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT via molecule-caption translation, which includes molecule understanding and text-based molecule generation. Experimental results show that MolReGPT outperforms fine-tuned models like MolT5-base without any additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is the first work to leverage LLMs in molecule-caption translation for advancing molecule discovery.

**Title:** On Kinetic Optimal Probability Paths for Generative Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06626  
**Abstract:** Recent successful generative models are trained by fitting a neural network to an a-priori defined tractable probability density path taking noise to training examples. In this paper we investigate the space of Gaussian probability paths, which includes diffusion paths as an instance, and look for an optimal member in some useful sense. In particular, minimizing the Kinetic Energy (KE) of a path is known to make particles' trajectories simple, hence easier to sample, and empirically improve performance in terms of likelihood of unseen data and sample generation quality. We investigate Kinetic Optimal (KO) Gaussian paths and offer the following observations: (i) We show the KE takes a simplified form on the space of Gaussian paths, where the data is incorporated only through a single, one dimensional scalar function, called the \emph{data separation function}. (ii) We characterize the KO solutions with a one dimensional ODE. (iii) We approximate data-dependent KO paths by approximating the data separation function and minimizing the KE. (iv) We prove that the data separation function converges to $1$ in the general case of arbitrary normalized dataset consisting of $n$ samples in $d$ dimension as $n/\sqrt{d}\rightarrow 0$. A consequence of this result is that the Conditional Optimal Transport (Cond-OT) path becomes \emph{kinetic optimal} as $n/\sqrt{d}\rightarrow 0$. We further support this theory with empirical experiments on ImageNet.

**Title:** 2-D SSM: A General Spatial Layer for Visual Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06635  
**Abstract:** A central objective in computer vision is to design models with appropriate 2-D inductive bias. Desiderata for 2D inductive bias include two-dimensional position awareness, dynamic spatial locality, and translation and permutation invariance. To address these goals, we leverage an expressive variation of the multidimensional State Space Model (SSM). Our approach introduces efficient parameterization, accelerated computation, and a suitable normalization scheme. Empirically, we observe that incorporating our layer at the beginning of each transformer block of Vision Transformers (ViT) significantly enhances performance for multiple ViT backbones and across datasets. The new layer is effective even with a negligible amount of additional parameters and inference time. Ablation studies and visualizations demonstrate that the layer has a strong 2-D inductive bias. For example, vision transformers equipped with our layer exhibit effective performance even without positional encoding

**Title:** Discontinuous Galerkin method based on the reduced space for the  nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction equation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06636  
**Abstract:** In this paper, by introducing a reconstruction operator based on the Legendre moments, we construct a reduced discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) space that could achieve the same approximation accuracy but using fewer degrees of freedom (DoFs) than the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space. The design of the ``narrow-stencil-based'' reconstruction operator can preserve the local data structure property of the high-order DG methods. With the RDG space, we apply the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method with the implicit-explicit time marching for the nonlinear unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction equation, where the reduction of the number of DoFs allows us to achieve higher efficiency. In terms of theoretical analysis, we give the well-posedness and approximation properties for the reconstruction operator and the $L^2$ error estimate for the semi-discrete LDG scheme. Several representative numerical tests demonstrate the accuracy and the performance of the proposed method in capturing the layers.

**Title:** VPUFormer: Visual Prompt Unified Transformer for Interactive Image  Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06656  
**Abstract:** The integration of diverse visual prompts like clicks, scribbles, and boxes in interactive image segmentation could significantly facilitate user interaction as well as improve interaction efficiency. Most existing studies focus on a single type of visual prompt by simply concatenating prompts and images as input for segmentation prediction, which suffers from low-efficiency prompt representation and weak interaction issues. This paper proposes a simple yet effective Visual Prompt Unified Transformer (VPUFormer), which introduces a concise unified prompt representation with deeper interaction to boost the segmentation performance. Specifically, we design a Prompt-unified Encoder (PuE) by using Gaussian mapping to generate a unified one-dimensional vector for click, box, and scribble prompts, which well captures users' intentions as well as provides a denser representation of user prompts. In addition, we present a Prompt-to-Pixel Contrastive Loss (P2CL) that leverages user feedback to gradually refine candidate semantic features, aiming to bring image semantic features closer to the features that are similar to the user prompt, while pushing away those image semantic features that are dissimilar to the user prompt, thereby correcting results that deviate from expectations. On this basis, our approach injects prompt representations as queries into Dual-cross Merging Attention (DMA) blocks to perform a deeper interaction between image and query inputs. A comprehensive variety of experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrates that the proposed VPUFormer with PuE, DMA, and P2CL achieves consistent improvements, yielding state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/XuZhang1211/VPUFormer.

**Title:** Self-Enhancement Improves Text-Image Retrieval in Foundation  Visual-Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06691  
**Abstract:** The emergence of cross-modal foundation models has introduced numerous approaches grounded in text-image retrieval. However, on some domain-specific retrieval tasks, these models fail to focus on the key attributes required. To address this issue, we propose a self-enhancement framework, A^{3}R, based on the CLIP-ViT/G-14, one of the largest cross-modal models. First, we perform an Attribute Augmentation strategy to enrich the textual description for fine-grained representation before model learning. Then, we propose an Adaption Re-ranking method to unify the representation space of textual query and candidate images and re-rank candidate images relying on the adapted query after model learning. The proposed framework is validated to achieve a salient improvement over the baseline and other teams' solutions in the cross-modal image retrieval track of the 1st foundation model challenge without introducing any additional samples.

**Title:** $E(2)$-Equivariant Vision Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06722  
**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable performance in computer vision. However, positional encoding in ViT makes it substantially difficult to learn the intrinsic equivariance in data. Initial attempts have been made on designing equivariant ViT but are proved defective in some cases in this paper. To address this issue, we design a Group Equivariant Vision Transformer (GE-ViT) via a novel, effective positional encoding operator. We prove that GE-ViT meets all the theoretical requirements of an equivariant neural network. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that GE-ViT significantly outperforms non-equivariant self-attention networks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZJUCDSYangKaifan/GEVit.

**Title:** The Impact of ChatGPT and LLMs on Medical Imaging Stakeholders:  Perspectives and Use Cases  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06767  
**Abstract:** This study investigates the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI ChatGPT, in medical imaging. With the aid of public data, these models, which possess remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities, are augmenting the interpretive skills of radiologists, enhancing patient-physician communication, and streamlining clinical workflows. The paper introduces an analytic framework for presenting the complex interactions between LLMs and the broader ecosystem of medical imaging stakeholders, including businesses, insurance entities, governments, research institutions, and hospitals (nicknamed BIGR-H). Through detailed analyses, illustrative use cases, and discussions on the broader implications and future directions, this perspective seeks to raise discussion in strategic planning and decision-making in the era of AI-enabled healthcare.

**Title:** Augmenting Greybox Fuzzing with Generative AI  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06782  
**Abstract:** Real-world programs expecting structured inputs often has a format-parsing stage gating the deeper program space. Neither a mutation-based approach nor a generative approach can provide a solution that is effective and scalable. Large language models (LLM) pre-trained with an enormous amount of natural language corpus have proved to be effective for understanding the implicit format syntax and generating format-conforming inputs. In this paper, propose ChatFuzz, a greybox fuzzer augmented by generative AI. More specifically, we pick a seed in the fuzzer's seed pool and prompt ChatGPT generative models to variations, which are more likely to be format-conforming and thus of high quality. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the best practice for harvesting the power of generative LLM models. The experiment results show that our approach improves the edge coverage by 12.77\% over the SOTA greybox fuzzer (AFL++) on 12 target programs from three well-tested benchmarks. As for vulnerability detection, \sys is able to perform similar to or better than AFL++ for programs with explicit syntax rules but not for programs with non-trivial syntax.

**Title:** A blind spot for large language models: Supradiegetic linguistic  information  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06794  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT reflect profound changes in the field of Artificial Intelligence, achieving a linguistic fluency that is impressively, even shockingly, human-like. The extent of their current and potential capabilities is an active area of investigation by no means limited to scientific researchers. It is common for people to frame the training data for LLMs as "text" or even "language". We examine the details of this framing using ideas from several areas, including linguistics, embodied cognition, cognitive science, mathematics, and history. We propose that considering what it is like to be an LLM like ChatGPT, as Nagel might have put it, can help us gain insight into its capabilities in general, and in particular, that its exposure to linguistic training data can be productively reframed as exposure to the diegetic information encoded in language, and its deficits can be reframed as ignorance of extradiegetic information, including supradiegetic linguistic information. Supradiegetic linguistic information consists of those arbitrary aspects of the physical form of language that are not derivable from the one-dimensional relations of context -- frequency, adjacency, proximity, co-occurrence -- that LLMs like ChatGPT have access to. Roughly speaking, the diegetic portion of a word can be thought of as its function, its meaning, as the information in a theoretical vector in a word embedding, while the supradiegetic portion of the word can be thought of as its form, like the shapes of its letters or the sounds of its syllables. We use these concepts to investigate why LLMs like ChatGPT have trouble handling palindromes, the visual characteristics of symbols, translating Sumerian cuneiform, and continuing integer sequences.

**Title:** Stable Remaster: Bridging the Gap Between Old Content and New Displays  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06803  
**Abstract:** The invention of modern displays has enhanced the viewer experience for any kind of content: ranging from sports to movies in 8K high-definition resolution. However, older content developed for CRT or early Plasma screen TVs has become outdated quickly and no longer meets current aspect ratio and resolution standards. In this paper, we explore whether we can solve this problem with the use of diffusion models to adapt old content to meet contemporary expectations. We explore the ability to combine multiple independent computer vision tasks to attempt to solve the problem of expanding aspect ratios of old animated content such that the new content would be indistinguishable from the source material to a brand-new viewer. These existing capabilities include Stable Diffusion, Content-Aware Scene Detection, Object Detection, and Key Point Matching. We were able to successfully chain these tasks together in a way that generated reasonable outputs, however, future work needs to be done to improve and expand the application to non-animated content as well.

**Title:** Multimodal Audio-textual Architecture for Robust Spoken Language  Understanding  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06819  
**Abstract:** Recent voice assistants are usually based on the cascade spoken language understanding (SLU) solution, which consists of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine and a natural language understanding (NLU) system. Because such approach relies on the ASR output, it often suffers from the so-called ASR error propagation. In this work, we investigate impacts of this ASR error propagation on state-of-the-art NLU systems based on pre-trained language models (PLM), such as BERT and RoBERTa. Moreover, a multimodal language understanding (MLU) module is proposed to mitigate SLU performance degradation caused by errors present in the ASR transcript. The MLU benefits from self-supervised features learned from both audio and text modalities, specifically Wav2Vec for speech and Bert/RoBERTa for language. Our MLU combines an encoder network to embed the audio signal and a text encoder to process text transcripts followed by a late fusion layer to fuse audio and text logits. We found that the proposed MLU showed to be robust towards poor quality ASR transcripts, while the performance of BERT and RoBERTa are severely compromised. Our model is evaluated on five tasks from three SLU datasets and robustness is tested using ASR transcripts from three ASR engines. Results show that the proposed approach effectively mitigates the ASR error propagation problem, surpassing the PLM models' performance across all datasets for the academic ASR engine.

**Title:** Leveraging Skill-to-Skill Supervision for Knowledge Tracing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06841  
**Abstract:** Knowledge tracing plays a pivotal role in intelligent tutoring systems. This task aims to predict the probability of students answering correctly to specific questions. To do so, knowledge tracing systems should trace the knowledge state of the students by utilizing their problem-solving history and knowledge about the problems. Recent advances in knowledge tracing models have enabled better exploitation of problem solving history. However, knowledge about problems has not been studied, as well compared to students' answering histories. Knowledge tracing algorithms that incorporate knowledge directly are important to settings with limited data or cold starts. Therefore, we consider the problem of utilizing skill-to-skill relation to knowledge tracing. In this work, we introduce expert labeled skill-to-skill relationships. Moreover, we also provide novel methods to construct a knowledge-tracing model to leverage human experts' insight regarding relationships between skills. The results of an extensive experimental analysis show that our method outperformed a baseline Transformer model. Furthermore, we found that the extent of our model's superiority was greater in situations with limited data, which allows a smooth cold start of our model.

**Title:** AerialFormer: Multi-resolution Transformer for Aerial Image Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06842  
**Abstract:** Aerial Image Segmentation is a top-down perspective semantic segmentation and has several challenging characteristics such as strong imbalance in the foreground-background distribution, complex background, intra-class heterogeneity, inter-class homogeneity, and tiny objects. To handle these problems, we inherit the advantages of Transformers and propose AerialFormer, which unifies Transformers at the contracting path with lightweight Multi-Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (MD-CNNs) at the expanding path. Our AerialFormer is designed as a hierarchical structure, in which Transformer encoder outputs multi-scale features and MD-CNNs decoder aggregates information from the multi-scales. Thus, it takes both local and global contexts into consideration to render powerful representations and high-resolution segmentation. We have benchmarked AerialFormer on three common datasets including iSAID, LoveDA, and Potsdam. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies show that our proposed AerialFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance. Our source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

**Title:** Mitigating Transformer Overconfidence via Lipschitz Regularization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06849  
**Abstract:** Though Transformers have achieved promising results in many computer vision tasks, they tend to be over-confident in predictions, as the standard Dot Product Self-Attention (DPSA) can barely preserve distance for the unbounded input domain. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a novel Lipschitz Regularized Transformer (LRFormer). Specifically, we present a new similarity function with the distance within Banach Space to ensure the Lipschitzness and also regularize the term by a contractive Lipschitz Bound. The proposed method is analyzed with a theoretical guarantee, providing a rigorous basis for its effectiveness and reliability. Extensive experiments conducted on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art single forward pass approaches in prediction, calibration, and uncertainty estimation.

**Title:** Sticker820K: Empowering Interactive Retrieval with Stickers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06870  
**Abstract:** Stickers have become a ubiquitous part of modern-day communication, conveying complex emotions through visual imagery. To facilitate the development of more powerful algorithms for analyzing stickers, we propose a large-scale Chinese sticker dataset, namely Sticker820K, which consists of 820k image-text pairs. Each sticker has rich and high-quality textual annotations, including descriptions, optical characters, emotional labels, and style classifications. Although vision-language tasks in the domain of natural images have been well studied, directly applying the those models, such as CLIP, to sticker data is not an optimal solution due to the discrepant nature between natural and emotive image data. Therefore, we propose StickerCLIP as a benchmark model on the Sticker820K dataset. For the text-to-image retrieval task, our StickerCLIP demonstrates strong superiority over the CLIP, which achieves an absolute gain of 66.0\% in mean recall on the Sticker820K test set. Additionally, we endeavor to extend the recently popularized LLM by means of prompt tuning, integrating its ability for sticker retrieval and allowing users to retrieve stickers through instructions. We validate the feasibility of this method, demonstrating the immense potential of prompt tuning in expanding LLM abilities while not affecting the quality of upstream tasks.

**Title:** VillanDiffusion: A Unified Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06874  
**Abstract:** Diffusion Models (DMs) are state-of-the-art generative models that learn a reversible corruption process from iterative noise addition and denoising. They are the backbone of many generative AI applications, such as text-to-image conditional generation. However, recent studies have shown that basic unconditional DMs (e.g., DDPM and DDIM) are vulnerable to backdoor injection, a type of output manipulation attack triggered by a maliciously embedded pattern at model input. This paper presents a unified backdoor attack framework (VillanDiffusion) to expand the current scope of backdoor analysis for DMs. Our framework covers mainstream unconditional and conditional DMs (denoising-based and score-based) and various training-free samplers for holistic evaluations. Experiments show that our unified framework facilitates the backdoor analysis of different DM configurations and provides new insights into caption-based backdoor attacks on DMs.

**Title:** NPVForensics: Jointing Non-critical Phonemes and Visemes for Deepfake  Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06885  
**Abstract:** Deepfake technologies empowered by deep learning are rapidly evolving, creating new security concerns for society. Existing multimodal detection methods usually capture audio-visual inconsistencies to expose Deepfake videos. More seriously, the advanced Deepfake technology realizes the audio-visual calibration of the critical phoneme-viseme regions, achieving a more realistic tampering effect, which brings new challenges. To address this problem, we propose a novel Deepfake detection method to mine the correlation between Non-critical Phonemes and Visemes, termed NPVForensics. Firstly, we propose the Local Feature Aggregation block with Swin Transformer (LFA-ST) to construct non-critical phoneme-viseme and corresponding facial feature streams effectively. Secondly, we design a loss function for the fine-grained motion of the talking face to measure the evolutionary consistency of non-critical phoneme-viseme. Next, we design a phoneme-viseme awareness module for cross-modal feature fusion and representation alignment, so that the modality gap can be reduced and the intrinsic complementarity of the two modalities can be better explored. Finally, a self-supervised pre-training strategy is leveraged to thoroughly learn the audio-visual correspondences in natural videos. In this manner, our model can be easily adapted to the downstream Deepfake datasets with fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

**Title:** Recursion of Thought: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Multi-Context  Reasoning with Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06891  
**Abstract:** Generating intermediate steps, or Chain of Thought (CoT), is an effective way to significantly improve language models' (LM) multi-step reasoning capability. However, the CoT lengths can grow rapidly with the problem complexity, easily exceeding the maximum context size. Instead of increasing the context limit, which has already been heavily investigated, we explore an orthogonal direction: making LMs divide a problem into multiple contexts. We propose a new inference framework, called Recursion of Thought (RoT), which introduces several special tokens that the models can output to trigger context-related operations. Extensive experiments with multiple architectures including GPT-3 show that RoT dramatically improves LMs' inference capability to solve problems, whose solution consists of hundreds of thousands of tokens.

**Title:** On the N-gram Approximation of Pre-trained Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06892  
**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, particularly in low-resource settings. Nevertheless, their potential in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the potential usage of PLMs for language modelling in ASR. We compare the application of large-scale text sampling and probability conversion for approximating GPT-2 into an n-gram model. Furthermore, we introduce a vocabulary-restricted decoding method for random sampling, and evaluate the effects of domain difficulty and data size on the usability of generated text. Our findings across eight domain-specific corpora support the use of sampling-based approximation and show that interpolating with a large sampled corpus improves test perplexity over a baseline trigram by 15%. Our vocabulary-restricted decoding method pushes this improvement further by 5% in domain-specific settings.

Recent deep learning methods for long-term series forecasting tend to capture the intricate patterns of time series by decomposition-based or sampling-based methods. However, most of the extracted patterns may include unpredictable noise and lack good interpretability. Moreover, the multivariate series forecasting methods usually ignore the individual characteristics of each variate, which may affecting the prediction accuracy. To capture the intrinsic patterns of time series, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture, named Multi-resolution Periodic Pattern Network (MPPN), for long-term series forecasting. We first construct context-aware multi-resolution semantic units of time series and employ multi-periodic pattern mining to capture the key patterns of time series. Then, we propose a channel adaptive module to capture the perceptions of multivariate towards different patterns. In addition, we present an entropy-based method for evaluating the predictability of time series and providing an upper bound on the prediction accuracy before forecasting. Our experimental evaluation on nine real-world benchmarks demonstrated that MPPN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based, decomposition-based and sampling-based methods for long-term series forecasting.

**Title:** Augmenting Zero-Shot Detection Training with Image Labels  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06899  
**Abstract:** Zero-shot detection (ZSD), i.e., detection on classes not seen during training, is essential for real world detection use-cases, but remains a difficult task. Recent research attempts ZSD with detection models that output embeddings instead of direct class labels. To this aim, the output of the detection model must be aligned to a learned embedding space such as CLIP. However, this alignment is hindered by detection data sets which are expensive to produce compared to image classification annotations, and the resulting lack of category diversity in the training data. We address this challenge by leveraging the CLIP embedding space in combination with image labels from ImageNet. Our results show that image labels are able to better align the detector output to the embedding space and thus have a high potential for ZSD. Compared to only training on detection data, we see a significant gain by adding image label data of 3.3 mAP for the 65/15 split on COCO on the unseen classes, i.e., we more than double the gain of related work.

**Title:** FocalGatedNet: A Novel Deep Learning Model for Accurate Knee Joint Angle  Prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06900  
**Abstract:** Predicting knee joint angles accurately is critical for biomechanical analysis and rehabilitation. This paper introduces a new deep learning model called FocalGatedNet that incorporates Dynamic Contextual Focus (DCF) Attention and Gated Linear Units (GLU) to enhance feature dependencies and interactions. Our proposed model is evaluated on a large-scale dataset and compared to existing models such as Transformer, Autoformer, Informer, NLinear, DLinear, and LSTM in multi-step gait trajectory prediction. Our results demonstrate that FocalGatedNet outperforms other state-of-the-art models for long-term prediction lengths (60 ms, 80 ms, and 100 ms), achieving an average improvement of 13.66% in MAE and 8.13% in RMSE compared to the second-best performing model (Transformer). Furthermore, our model has a lower computational load than most equivalent deep learning models. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed model for knee joint angle prediction and the importance of our modifications for this specific application.

**Title:** Network Robustness Learning via Graph Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06913  
**Abstract:** Learning and analysis of network robustness, including controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, is critical for various networked systems against attacks. Traditionally, network robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is very time-consuming and even incapable for large-scale networks. Network Robustness Learning, which is dedicated to learning network robustness with high precision and high speed, provides a powerful tool to analyze network robustness by replacing simulations. In this paper, a novel versatile and unified robustness learning approach via graph transformer (NRL-GT) is proposed, which accomplishes the task of controllability robustness learning and connectivity robustness learning from multiple aspects including robustness curve learning, overall robustness learning, and synthetic network classification. Numerous experiments show that: 1) NRL-GT is a unified learning framework for controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, demonstrating a strong generalization ability to ensure high precision when training and test sets are distributed differently; 2) Compared to the cutting-edge methods, NRL-GT can simultaneously perform network robustness learning from multiple aspects and obtains superior results in less time. NRL-GT is also able to deal with complex networks of different size with low learning error and high efficiency; 3) It is worth mentioning that the backbone of NRL-GT can serve as a transferable feature learning module for complex networks of different size and different downstream tasks.

**Title:** Learning Multilingual Sentence Representations with Cross-lingual  Consistency Regularization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06919  
**Abstract:** Multilingual sentence representations are the foundation for similarity-based bitext mining, which is crucial for scaling multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) system to more languages. In this paper, we introduce MuSR: a one-for-all Multilingual Sentence Representation model that supports more than 220 languages. Leveraging billions of English-centric parallel corpora, we train a multilingual Transformer encoder, coupled with an auxiliary Transformer decoder, by adopting a multilingual NMT framework with CrossConST, a cross-lingual consistency regularization technique proposed in Gao et al. (2023). Experimental results on multilingual similarity search and bitext mining tasks show the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, MuSR achieves superior performance over LASER3 (Heffernan et al., 2022) which consists of 148 independent multilingual sentence encoders.

**Title:** Scale-Rotation-Equivariant Lie Group Convolution Neural Networks (Lie  Group-CNNs)  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06934  
**Abstract:** The weight-sharing mechanism of convolutional kernels ensures translation-equivariance of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Recently, rotation-equivariance has been investigated. However, research on scale-equivariance or simultaneous scale-rotation-equivariance is insufficient. This study proposes a Lie group-CNN, which can keep scale-rotation-equivariance for image classification tasks. The Lie group-CNN includes a lifting module, a series of group convolution modules, a global pooling layer, and a classification layer. The lifting module transfers the input image from Euclidean space to Lie group space, and the group convolution is parameterized through a fully connected network using Lie-algebra of Lie-group elements as inputs to achieve scale-rotation-equivariance. The Lie group SIM(2) is utilized to establish the Lie group-CNN with scale-rotation-equivariance. Scale-rotation-equivariance of Lie group-CNN is verified and achieves the best recognition accuracy on the blood cell dataset (97.50%) and the HAM10000 dataset (77.90%) superior to Lie algebra convolution network, dilation convolution, spatial transformer network, and scale-equivariant steerable network. In addition, the generalization ability of the Lie group-CNN on SIM(2) on rotation-equivariance is verified on rotated-MNIST and rotated-CIFAR10, and the robustness of the network is verified on SO(2) and SE(2). Therefore, the Lie group-CNN can successfully extract geometric features and performs equivariant recognition on images with rotation and scale transformations.

**Title:** The BEA 2023 Shared Task on Generating AI Teacher Responses in  Educational Dialogues  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06941  
**Abstract:** This paper describes the results of the first shared task on the generation of teacher responses in educational dialogues. The goal of the task was to benchmark the ability of generative language models to act as AI teachers, replying to a student in a teacher-student dialogue. Eight teams participated in the competition hosted on CodaLab. They experimented with a wide variety of state-of-the-art models, including Alpaca, Bloom, DialoGPT, DistilGPT-2, Flan-T5, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT- 4, LLaMA, OPT-2.7B, and T5-base. Their submissions were automatically scored using BERTScore and DialogRPT metrics, and the top three among them were further manually evaluated in terms of pedagogical ability based on Tack and Piech (2022). The NAISTeacher system, which ranked first in both automated and human evaluation, generated responses with GPT-3.5 using an ensemble of prompts and a DialogRPT-based ranking of responses for given dialogue contexts. Despite the promising achievements of the participating teams, the results also highlight the need for evaluation metrics better suited to educational contexts.

**Title:** Fast Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06991  
**Abstract:** Despite their success in real data synthesis, diffusion models (DMs) often suffer from slow and costly training and sampling issues, limiting their broader applications. To mitigate this, we propose a Fast Diffusion Model (FDM) which improves the diffusion process of DMs from a stochastic optimization perspective to speed up both training and sampling. Specifically, we first find that the diffusion process of DMs accords with the stochastic optimization process of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a stochastic time-variant problem. Note that momentum SGD uses both the current gradient and an extra momentum, achieving more stable and faster convergence. We are inspired to introduce momentum into the diffusion process to accelerate both training and sampling. However, this comes with the challenge of deriving the noise perturbation kernel from the momentum-based diffusion process. To this end, we frame the momentum-based process as a Damped Oscillation system whose critically damped state -- the kernel solution -- avoids oscillation and thus has a faster convergence speed of the diffusion process. Empirical results show that our FDM can be applied to several popular DM frameworks, e.g. VP, VE, and EDM, and reduces their training cost by about 50% with comparable image synthesis performance on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and AFHQv2 datasets. Moreover, FDM decreases their sampling steps by about $3\times$ to achieve similar performance under the same deterministic samplers. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/FDM.

**Title:** Correlated Time Series Self-Supervised Representation Learning via  Spatiotemporal Bootstrapping  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06994  
**Abstract:** Correlated time series analysis plays an important role in many real-world industries. Learning an efficient representation of this large-scale data for further downstream tasks is necessary but challenging. In this paper, we propose a time-step-level representation learning framework for individual instances via bootstrapped spatiotemporal representation prediction. We evaluated the effectiveness and flexibility of our representation learning framework on correlated time series forecasting and cold-start transferring the forecasting model to new instances with limited data. A linear regression model trained on top of the learned representations demonstrates our model performs best in most cases. Especially compared to representation learning models, we reduce the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 37%, 49%, and 48% on the PeMS-BAY dataset, respectively. Furthermore, in real-world metro passenger flow data, our framework demonstrates the ability to transfer to infer future information of new cold-start instances, with gains of 15%, 19%, and 18%. The source code will be released under the GitHub https://github.com/bonaldli/Spatiotemporal-TS-Representation-Learning

**Title:** Slot-VAE: Object-Centric Scene Generation with Slot Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06997  
**Abstract:** Slot attention has shown remarkable object-centric representation learning performance in computer vision tasks without requiring any supervision. Despite its object-centric binding ability brought by compositional modelling, as a deterministic module, slot attention lacks the ability to generate novel scenes. In this paper, we propose the Slot-VAE, a generative model that integrates slot attention with the hierarchical VAE framework for object-centric structured scene generation. For each image, the model simultaneously infers a global scene representation to capture high-level scene structure and object-centric slot representations to embed individual object components. During generation, slot representations are generated from the global scene representation to ensure coherent scene structures. Our extensive evaluation of the scene generation ability indicates that Slot-VAE outperforms slot representation-based generative baselines in terms of sample quality and scene structure accuracy.

**Title:** Imbalanced Multi-label Classification for Business-related Text with  Moderately Large Label Spaces  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07046  
**Abstract:** In this study, we compared the performance of four different methods for multi label text classification using a specific imbalanced business dataset. The four methods we evaluated were fine tuned BERT, Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, and Label Powerset. The results show that fine tuned BERT outperforms the other three methods by a significant margin, achieving high values of accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, and Recall. Binary Relevance also performs well on this dataset, while Classifier Chains and Label Powerset demonstrate relatively poor performance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of fine tuned BERT for multi label text classification tasks, and suggest that it may be a useful tool for businesses seeking to analyze complex and multifaceted texts.

**Title:** Large Language Models as Tax Attorneys: A Case Study in Legal  Capabilities Emergence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07075  
**Abstract:** Better understanding of Large Language Models' (LLMs) legal analysis abilities can contribute to improving the efficiency of legal services, governing artificial intelligence, and leveraging LLMs to identify inconsistencies in law. This paper explores LLM capabilities in applying tax law. We choose this area of law because it has a structure that allows us to set up automated validation pipelines across thousands of examples, requires logical reasoning and maths skills, and enables us to test LLM capabilities in a manner relevant to real-world economic lives of citizens and companies. Our experiments demonstrate emerging legal understanding capabilities, with improved performance in each subsequent OpenAI model release. We experiment with retrieving and utilising the relevant legal authority to assess the impact of providing additional legal context to LLMs. Few-shot prompting, presenting examples of question-answer pairs, is also found to significantly enhance the performance of the most advanced model, GPT-4. The findings indicate that LLMs, particularly when combined with prompting enhancements and the correct legal texts, can perform at high levels of accuracy but not yet at expert tax lawyer levels. As LLMs continue to advance, their ability to reason about law autonomously could have significant implications for the legal profession and AI governance.

**Title:** Latent Dynamical Implicit Diffusion Processes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07077  
**Abstract:** Latent dynamical models are commonly used to learn the distribution of a latent dynamical process that represents a sequence of noisy data samples. However, producing samples from such models with high fidelity is challenging due to the complexity and variability of latent and observation dynamics. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, such as DDPM and NCSN, have shown promising alternatives to state-of-the-art latent generative models, such as Neural ODEs, RNNs, and Normalizing flow networks, for generating high-quality sequential samples from a prior distribution. However, their application in modeling sequential data with latent dynamical models is yet to be explored. Here, we propose a novel latent variable model named latent dynamical implicit diffusion processes (LDIDPs), which utilizes implicit diffusion processes to sample from dynamical latent processes and generate sequential observation samples accordingly. We tested LDIDPs on synthetic and simulated neural decoding problems. We demonstrate that LDIDPs can accurately learn the dynamics over latent dimensions. Furthermore, the implicit sampling method allows for the computationally efficient generation of high-quality sequential data samples from the latent and observation spaces.

**Title:** Linear Classifier: An Often-Forgotten Baseline for Text Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07111  
**Abstract:** Large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT are popular solutions for text classification. Due to the superior performance of these advanced methods, nowadays, people often directly train them for a few epochs and deploy the obtained model. In this opinion paper, we point out that this way may only sometimes get satisfactory results. We argue the importance of running a simple baseline like linear classifiers on bag-of-words features along with advanced methods. First, for many text data, linear methods show competitive performance, high efficiency, and robustness. Second, advanced models such as BERT may only achieve the best results if properly applied. Simple baselines help to confirm whether the results of advanced models are acceptable. Our experimental results fully support these points.

**Title:** Exploring Attention Mechanisms for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in an  Emergency Call Center Corpus  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07115  
**Abstract:** The emotion detection technology to enhance human decision-making is an important research issue for real-world applications, but real-life emotion datasets are relatively rare and small. The experiments conducted in this paper use the CEMO, which was collected in a French emergency call center. Two pre-trained models based on speech and text were fine-tuned for speech emotion recognition. Using pre-trained Transformer encoders mitigates our data's limited and sparse nature. This paper explores the different fusion strategies of these modality-specific models. In particular, fusions with and without cross-attention mechanisms were tested to gather the most relevant information from both the speech and text encoders. We show that multimodal fusion brings an absolute gain of 4-9% with respect to either single modality and that the Symmetric multi-headed cross-attention mechanism performed better than late classical fusion approaches. Our experiments also suggest that for the real-life CEMO corpus, the audio component encodes more emotive information than the textual one.

**Title:** InstructP2P: Learning to Edit 3D Point Clouds with Text Instructions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07154  
**Abstract:** Enhancing AI systems to perform tasks following human instructions can significantly boost productivity. In this paper, we present InstructP2P, an end-to-end framework for 3D shape editing on point clouds, guided by high-level textual instructions. InstructP2P extends the capabilities of existing methods by synergizing the strengths of a text-conditioned point cloud diffusion model, Point-E, and powerful language models, enabling color and geometry editing using language instructions. To train InstructP2P, we introduce a new shape editing dataset, constructed by integrating a shape segmentation dataset, off-the-shelf shape programs, and diverse edit instructions generated by a large language model, ChatGPT. Our proposed method allows for editing both color and geometry of specific regions in a single forward pass, while leaving other regions unaffected. In our experiments, InstructP2P shows generalization capabilities, adapting to novel shape categories and instructions, despite being trained on a limited amount of data.

**Title:** Looking Around Corners: Generative Methods in Terrain Extension  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07160  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we provide an early look at our model for generating terrain that is occluded in the initial lidar scan or out of range of the sensor. As a proof of concept, we show that a transformer based framework is able to be overfit to predict the geometries of unobserved roads around intersections or corners. We discuss our method for generating training data, as well as a unique loss function for training our terrain extension network. The framework is tested on data from the SemanticKitti [1] dataset. Unlabeled point clouds measured from an onboard lidar are used as input data to generate predicted road points that are out of range or occluded in the original point-cloud scan. Then the input pointcloud and predicted terrain are concatenated to the terrain-extended pointcloud. We show promising qualitative results from these methods, as well as discussion for potential quantitative metrics to evaluate the overall success of our framework. Finally, we discuss improvements that can be made to the framework for successful generalization to test sets.

**Title:** Prompt-based Extraction of Social Determinants of Health Using Few-shot  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07170  
**Abstract:** Social determinants of health (SDOH) documented in the electronic health record through unstructured text are increasingly being studied to understand how SDOH impacts patient health outcomes. In this work, we utilize the Social History Annotation Corpus (SHAC), a multi-institutional corpus of de-identified social history sections annotated for SDOH, including substance use, employment, and living status information. We explore the automatic extraction of SDOH information with SHAC in both standoff and inline annotation formats using GPT-4 in a one-shot prompting setting. We compare GPT-4 extraction performance with a high-performing supervised approach and perform thorough error analyses. Our prompt-based GPT-4 method achieved an overall 0.652 F1 on the SHAC test set, similar to the 7th best-performing system among all teams in the n2c2 challenge with SHAC.

**Title:** Diffusion Models for Black-Box Optimization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07180  
**Abstract:** The goal of offline black-box optimization (BBO) is to optimize an expensive black-box function using a fixed dataset of function evaluations. Prior works consider forward approaches that learn surrogates to the black-box function and inverse approaches that directly map function values to corresponding points in the input domain of the black-box function. These approaches are limited by the quality of the offline dataset and the difficulty in learning one-to-many mappings in high dimensions, respectively. We propose Denoising Diffusion Optimization Models (DDOM), a new inverse approach for offline black-box optimization based on diffusion models. Given an offline dataset, DDOM learns a conditional generative model over the domain of the black-box function conditioned on the function values. We investigate several design choices in DDOM, such as re-weighting the dataset to focus on high function values and the use of classifier-free guidance at test-time to enable generalization to function values that can even exceed the dataset maxima. Empirically, we conduct experiments on the Design-Bench benchmark and show that DDOM achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.

**Title:** CD-CTFM: A Lightweight CNN-Transformer Network for Remote Sensing Cloud  Detection Fusing Multiscale Features  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07186  
**Abstract:** Clouds in remote sensing images inevitably affect information extraction, which hinder the following analysis of satellite images. Hence, cloud detection is a necessary preprocessing procedure. However, the existing methods have numerous calculations and parameters. In this letter, a lightweight CNN-Transformer network, CD-CTFM, is proposed to solve the problem. CD-CTFM is based on encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates the attention mechanism. In the decoder part, we utilize a lightweight network combing CNN and Transformer as backbone, which is conducive to extract local and global features simultaneously. Moreover, a lightweight feature pyramid module is designed to fuse multiscale features with contextual information. In the decoder part, we integrate a lightweight channel-spatial attention module into each skip connection between encoder and decoder, extracting low-level features while suppressing irrelevant information without introducing many parameters. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on two cloud datasets, 38-Cloud and MODIS. The results demonstrate that CD-CTFM achieves comparable accuracy as the state-of-art methods. At the same time, CD-CTFM outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of efficiency.

**Title:** Large language models and (non-)linguistic recursion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07195  
**Abstract:** Recursion is one of the hallmarks of human language. While many design features of language have been shown to exist in animal communication systems, recursion has not. Previous research shows that GPT-4 is the first large language model (LLM) to exhibit metalinguistic abilities (Begu\v{s}, D\k{a}bkowski, and Rhodes 2023). Here, we propose several prompt designs aimed at eliciting and analyzing recursive behavior in LLMs, both linguistic and non-linguistic. We demonstrate that when explicitly prompted, GPT-4 can both produce and analyze recursive structures. Thus, we present one of the first studies investigating whether meta-linguistic awareness of recursion -- a uniquely human cognitive property -- can emerge in transformers with a high number of parameters such as GPT-4.

**Title:** Retrieval-Enhanced Contrastive Vision-Text Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07196  
**Abstract:** Contrastive image-text models such as CLIP form the building blocks of many state-of-the-art systems. While they excel at recognizing common generic concepts, they still struggle on fine-grained entities which are rare, or even absent from the pre-training dataset. Hence, a key ingredient to their success has been the use of large-scale curated pre-training data aiming at expanding the set of concepts that they can memorize during the pre-training stage. In this work, we explore an alternative to encoding fine-grained knowledge directly into the model's parameters: we instead train the model to retrieve this knowledge from an external memory. Specifically, we propose to equip existing vision-text models with the ability to refine their embedding with cross-modal retrieved information from a memory at inference time, which greatly improves their zero-shot predictions. Remarkably, we show that this can be done with a light-weight, single-layer, fusion transformer on top of a frozen CLIP. Our experiments validate that our retrieval-enhanced contrastive (RECO) training improves CLIP performance substantially on several challenging fine-grained tasks: for example +10.9 on Stanford Cars, +10.2 on CUB-2011 and +7.3 on the recent OVEN benchmark.

**Title:** A Survey of Vision-Language Pre-training from the Lens of Multimodal  Machine Translation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07198  
**Abstract:** Large language models such as BERT and the GPT series started a paradigm shift that calls for building general-purpose models via pre-training on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on task-specific datasets. There is now a plethora of large pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Recently, we have seen rapid developments in the joint Vision-Language space as well, where pre-trained models such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) have demonstrated improvements in downstream tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. However, surprisingly there is comparatively little work on exploring these models for the task of multimodal machine translation, where the goal is to leverage image/video modality in text-to-text translation. To fill this gap, this paper surveys the landscape of language-and-vision pre-training from the lens of multimodal machine translation. We summarize the common architectures, pre-training objectives, and datasets from literature and conjecture what further is needed to make progress on multimodal machine translation.

**Abstract:** Endowing chatbots with a consistent persona is essential to an engaging conversation, yet it remains an unresolved challenge. In this work, we propose a new retrieval-enhanced approach for personalized response generation. Specifically, we design a hierarchical transformer retriever trained on dialogue domain data to perform personalized retrieval and a context-aware prefix encoder that fuses the retrieved information to the decoder more effectively. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model at generating more fluent and personalized responses. We quantitatively evaluate our model's performance under a suite of human and automatic metrics and find it to be superior compared to state-of-the-art baselines on English Reddit conversations.

**Title:** Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced abilitY  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07207  
**Abstract:** Recently, several multi-modal models have been developed for joint image and language understanding, which have demonstrated impressive chat abilities by utilizing advanced large language models (LLMs). The process of developing such models is straightforward yet effective. It involves pre-training an adaptation module to align the semantics of the vision encoder and language model, followed by fine-tuning on the instruction-following data. However, despite the success of this pipeline in image and language understanding, its effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been widely explored. In this paper, we aim to develop a novel multi-modal foundation model capable of perceiving video, image, and language within a general framework. To achieve this goal, we introduce Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced ability. Specifically, our proposed Valley model is designed with a simple projection module that bridges video, image, and language modalities, and is further unified with a multi-lingual LLM. We also collect multi-source vision-text pairs and adopt a spatio-temporal pooling strategy to obtain a unified vision encoding of video and image input for pre-training. Furthermore, we generate multi-task instruction-following video data, including multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal relationship inference, etc. To obtain the instruction-following data, we design diverse rounds of task-oriented conversations between humans and videos, facilitated by ChatGPT. Qualitative examples demonstrate that our proposed model has the potential to function as a highly effective multilingual video assistant that can make complex video understanding scenarios easy. Code, data, and models will be available at https://github.com/RupertLuo/Valley.

**Title:** Generic Attacks against Cryptographic Hardware through Long-Range Deep  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07249  
**Abstract:** Hardware-based cryptographic implementations utilize countermeasures to resist side-channel attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning architecture for side-channel analysis called SCANET that generalizes across multiple implementations and algorithms without manual tuning or trace pre-processing. We achieve this by combining a novel input processing technique with several advanced deep learning techniques including transformer blocks and multi-task learning. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by successfully attacking four hardware-accelerated countermeasures for elliptic curve digital signatures in an end-to-end manner without human tuning. Additionally, we showcase SCANET's ability to generalize across multiple algorithms by successfully replicating state-of-the-art attacks against protected AES without the need for trace preprocessing, hand-tuning, or model architectural changes. These results offer promising prospects for generic and automated side-channel leakage evaluation without manual effort.

**Title:** MovieFactory: Automatic Movie Creation from Text using Large Generative  Models for Language and Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07257  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present MovieFactory, a powerful framework to generate cinematic-picture (3072$\times$1280), film-style (multi-scene), and multi-modality (sounding) movies on the demand of natural languages. As the first fully automated movie generation model to the best of our knowledge, our approach empowers users to create captivating movies with smooth transitions using simple text inputs, surpassing existing methods that produce soundless videos limited to a single scene of modest quality. To facilitate this distinctive functionality, we leverage ChatGPT to expand user-provided text into detailed sequential scripts for movie generation. Then we bring scripts to life visually and acoustically through vision generation and audio retrieval. To generate videos, we extend the capabilities of a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model through a two-stage process. Firstly, we employ spatial finetuning to bridge the gap between the pretrained image model and the new video dataset. Subsequently, we introduce temporal learning to capture object motion. In terms of audio, we leverage sophisticated retrieval models to select and align audio elements that correspond to the plot and visual content of the movie. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MovieFactory produces movies with realistic visuals, diverse scenes, and seamlessly fitting audio, offering users a novel and immersive experience. Generated samples can be found in YouTube or Bilibili (1080P).

**Title:** Zero-shot Composed Text-Image Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07272  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we consider the problem of composed image retrieval (CIR), it aims to train a model that can fuse multi-modal information, e.g., text and images, to accurately retrieve images that match the query, extending the user's expression ability. We make the following contributions: (i) we initiate a scalable pipeline to automatically construct datasets for training CIR model, by simply exploiting a large-scale dataset of image-text pairs, e.g., a subset of LAION-5B; (ii) we introduce a transformer-based adaptive aggregation model, TransAgg, which employs a simple yet efficient fusion mechanism, to adaptively combine information from diverse modalities; (iii) we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the usefulness of our proposed data construction procedure, and the effectiveness of core components in TransAgg; (iv) when evaluating on the publicly available benckmarks under the zero-shot scenario, i.e., training on the automatically constructed datasets, then directly conduct inference on target downstream datasets, e.g., CIRR and FashionIQ, our proposed approach either performs on par with or significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07280  
**Abstract:** Large text-to-image diffusion models have impressive capabilities in generating photorealistic images from text prompts. How to effectively guide or control these powerful models to perform different downstream tasks becomes an important open problem. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a principled finetuning method -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT), for adapting text-to-image diffusion models to downstream tasks. Unlike existing methods, OFT can provably preserve hyperspherical energy which characterizes the pairwise neuron relationship on the unit hypersphere. We find that this property is crucial for preserving the semantic generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models. To improve finetuning stability, we further propose Constrained Orthogonal Finetuning (COFT) which imposes an additional radius constraint to the hypersphere. Specifically, we consider two important finetuning text-to-image tasks: subject-driven generation where the goal is to generate subject-specific images given a few images of a subject and a text prompt, and controllable generation where the goal is to enable the model to take in additional control signals. We empirically show that our OFT framework outperforms existing methods in generation quality and convergence speed.

**Title:** Waffling around for Performance: Visual Classification with Random Words  and Broad Concepts  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07282  
**Abstract:** The visual classification performance of vision-language models such as CLIP can benefit from additional semantic knowledge, e.g. via large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3. Further extending classnames with LLM-generated class descriptors, e.g. ``waffle, \textit{which has a round shape}'', or averaging retrieval scores over multiple such descriptors, has been shown to improve generalization performance. In this work, we study this behavior in detail and propose \texttt{Waffle}CLIP, a framework for zero-shot visual classification which achieves similar performance gains on a large number of visual classification tasks by simply replacing LLM-generated descriptors with random character and word descriptors \textbf{without} querying external models. We extend these results with an extensive experimental study on the impact and shortcomings of additional semantics introduced via LLM-generated descriptors, and showcase how semantic context is better leveraged by automatically querying LLMs for high-level concepts, while jointly resolving potential class name ambiguities.

**Title:** Physics-separating artificial neural networks for predicting sputtering  and thin film deposition of AlN in Ar/N$_2$ discharges on experimental  timescales  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03524  
**Abstract:** Understanding and modeling plasma-surface interactions frame a multi-scale as well as multi-physics problem. Scale-bridging machine learning surface surrogate models have been demonstrated to perceive the fundamental atomic fidelity for the physical vapor deposition of pure metals. However, the immense computational cost of the data-generating simulations render a practical application with predictions on relevant timescales impracticable. This issue is resolved in this work for the sputter deposition of AlN in Ar/N$_2$ discharges by developing a scheme that populates the parameter spaces effectively. Hybrid reactive molecular dynamics / time-stamped force-bias Monte Carlo simulations of randomized plasma-surface interactions / diffusion processes are used to setup a physics-separating artificial neural network. The application of this generic machine learning model to a specific experimental reference case study enables the systematic analysis of the particle flux emission as well as underlying system state (e.g., composition, mass density, stress, point defect structure) evolution within process times of up to 45 minutes.

**Title:** Energy-efficient Wearable-to-Mobile Offload of ML Inference for  PPG-based Heart-Rate Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06129  
**Abstract:** Modern smartwatches often include photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensors to measure heartbeats or blood pressure through complex algorithms that fuse PPG data with other signals. In this work, we propose a collaborative inference approach that uses both a smartwatch and a connected smartphone to maximize the performance of heart rate (HR) tracking while also maximizing the smartwatch's battery life. In particular, we first analyze the trade-offs between running on-device HR tracking or offloading the work to the mobile. Then, thanks to an additional step to evaluate the difficulty of the upcoming HR prediction, we demonstrate that we can smartly manage the workload between smartwatch and smartphone, maintaining a low mean absolute error (MAE) while reducing energy consumption. We benchmark our approach on a custom smartwatch prototype, including the STM32WB55 MCU and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) communication, and a Raspberry Pi3 as a proxy for the smartphone. With our Collaborative Heart Rate Inference System (CHRIS), we obtain a set of Pareto-optimal configurations demonstrating the same MAE as State-of-Art (SoA) algorithms while consuming less energy. For instance, we can achieve approximately the same MAE of TimePPG-Small (5.54 BPM MAE vs. 5.60 BPM MAE) while reducing the energy by 2.03x, with a configuration that offloads 80\% of the predictions to the phone. Furthermore, accepting a performance degradation to 7.16 BPM of MAE, we can achieve an energy consumption of 179 uJ per prediction, 3.03x less than running TimePPG-Small on the smartwatch, and 1.82x less than streaming all the input data to the phone.

**Title:** Extraction and Recovery of Spatio-Temporal Structure in Latent Dynamics  Alignment with Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06138  
**Abstract:** In the field of behavior-related brain computation, it is necessary to meaningfully align raw neural population activities against the drastic shift between them. However, the alignment is non-trivial since most neural population activities are in a multivariate time-series manner. An instrumental framework within neuroscience research posits that trial-based neural population activities rely on low-dimensional latent dynamics. Focusing on such latent dynamics greatly facilitates the alignment procedure. Despite the considerable progress we have reached, existing methods usually ignore the intrinsic spatio-temporal structures within latent dynamics. Thus, those solutions lead to poor quality in dynamics structures and overall performance after alignment. To tackle this problem, we propose a method leveraging the expressiveness of diffusion model to relieve such issues. Specifically, the latent dynamics structures of the source domain are first extracted by the diffusion model. Then, such structures are well-recovered through a maximum likelihood alignment procedure on the target domain. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a synthetic dataset. Then, when applied to neural recordings from primate motor cortex, under both cross-day and inter-subject settings, our method consistently manifests its capability of preserving the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics and outperforms existing approaches in alignment quality.

**Title:** PoET: A generative model of protein families as sequences-of-sequences  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06156  
**Abstract:** Generative protein language models are a natural way to design new proteins with desired functions. However, current models are either difficult to direct to produce a protein from a specific family of interest, or must be trained on a large multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from the specific family of interest, making them unable to benefit from transfer learning across families. To address this, we propose $\textbf{P}$r$\textbf{o}$tein $\textbf{E}$volutionary $\textbf{T}$ransformer (PoET), an autoregressive generative model of whole protein families that learns to generate sets of related proteins as sequences-of-sequences across tens of millions of natural protein sequence clusters. PoET can be used as a retrieval-augmented language model to generate and score arbitrary modifications conditioned on any protein family of interest, and can extrapolate from short context lengths to generalize well even for small families. This is enabled by a unique Transformer layer; we model tokens sequentially within sequences while attending between sequences order invariantly, allowing PoET to scale to context lengths beyond those used during training. PoET outperforms existing protein language models and evolutionary sequence models for variant function prediction in extensive experiments on deep mutational scanning datasets, improving variant effect prediction across proteins of all MSA depths.

**Title:** BioGAN: An unpaired GAN-based image to image translation model for  microbiological images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06217  
**Abstract:** A diversified dataset is crucial for training a well-generalized supervised computer vision algorithm. However, in the field of microbiology, generation and annotation of a diverse dataset including field-taken images are time consuming, costly, and in some cases impossible. Image to image translation frameworks allow us to diversify the dataset by transferring images from one domain to another. However, most existing image translation techniques require a paired dataset (original image and its corresponding image in the target domain), which poses a significant challenge in collecting such datasets. In addition, the application of these image translation frameworks in microbiology is rarely discussed. In this study, we aim to develop an unpaired GAN-based (Generative Adversarial Network) image to image translation model for microbiological images, and study how it can improve generalization ability of object detection models. In this paper, we present an unpaired and unsupervised image translation model to translate laboratory-taken microbiological images to field images, building upon the recent advances in GAN networks and Perceptual loss function. We propose a novel design for a GAN model, BioGAN, by utilizing Adversarial and Perceptual loss in order to transform high level features of laboratory-taken images into field images, while keeping their spatial features. The contribution of Adversarial and Perceptual loss in the generation of realistic field images were studied. We used the synthetic field images, generated by BioGAN, to train an object-detection framework, and compared the results with those of an object-detection framework trained with laboratory images; this resulted in up to 68.1% and 75.3% improvement on F1-score and mAP, respectively.

**Title:** Generalized optimal transport and mean field control problems for  reaction-diffusion systems with high-order finite element computation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06287  
**Abstract:** We design and compute a class of optimal control problems for reaction-diffusion systems. They form mean field control problems related to multi-density reaction-diffusion systems. To solve proposed optimal control problems numerically, we first apply high-order finite element methods to discretize the space-time domain and then solve the optimal control problem using augmented Lagrangian methods (ALG2). Numerical examples, including generalized optimal transport and mean field control problems between Gaussian distributions and image densities, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and computational methods for mean field control problems involving reaction-diffusion equations/systems.

**Title:** Response Time Improves Choice Prediction and Function Estimation for  Gaussian Process Models of Perception and Preferences  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06296  
**Abstract:** Models for human choice prediction in preference learning and psychophysics often consider only binary response data, requiring many samples to accurately learn preferences or perceptual detection thresholds. The response time (RT) to make each choice captures additional information about the decision process, however existing models incorporating RTs for choice prediction do so in fully parametric settings or over discrete stimulus sets. This is in part because the de-facto standard model for choice RTs, the diffusion decision model (DDM), does not admit tractable, differentiable inference. The DDM thus cannot be easily integrated with flexible models for continuous, multivariate function approximation, particularly Gaussian process (GP) models. We propose a novel differentiable approximation to the DDM likelihood using a family of known, skewed three-parameter distributions. We then use this new likelihood to incorporate RTs into GP models for binary choices. Our RT-choice GPs enable both better latent value estimation and held-out choice prediction relative to baselines, which we demonstrate on three real-world multivariate datasets covering both human psychophysics and preference learning applications.

**Title:** What Can an Accent Identifier Learn? Probing Phonetic and Prosodic  Information in a Wav2vec2-based Accent Identification Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06524  
**Abstract:** This study is focused on understanding and quantifying the change in phoneme and prosody information encoded in the Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model, brought by an accent identification (AID) fine-tuning task. This problem is addressed based on model probing. Specifically, we conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis of the representations of the Transformer layers on a phoneme correlation task, and a novel word-level prosody prediction task. We compare the probing performance of the pre-trained and fine-tuned SSL models. Results show that the AID fine-tuning task steers the top 2 layers to learn richer phoneme and prosody representation. These changes share some similarities with the effects of fine-tuning with an Automatic Speech Recognition task. In addition, we observe strong accent-specific phoneme representations in layer 9. To sum up, this study provides insights into the understanding of SSL features and their interactions with fine-tuning tasks.

**Title:** TransMRSR: Transformer-based Self-Distilled Generative Prior for Brain  MRI Super-Resolution  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06669  
**Abstract:** Magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired with low through-plane resolution compromise time and cost. The poor resolution in one orientation is insufficient to meet the requirement of high resolution for early diagnosis of brain disease and morphometric study. The common Single image super-resolution (SISR) solutions face two main challenges: (1) local detailed and global anatomical structural information combination; and (2) large-scale restoration when applied for reconstructing thick-slice MRI into high-resolution (HR) iso-tropic data. To address these problems, we propose a novel two-stage network for brain MRI SR named TransMRSR based on the convolutional blocks to extract local information and transformer blocks to capture long-range dependencies. TransMRSR consists of three modules: the shallow local feature extraction, the deep non-local feature capture, and the HR image reconstruction. We perform a generative task to encapsulate diverse priors into a generative network (GAN), which is the decoder sub-module of the deep non-local feature capture part, in the first stage. The pre-trained GAN is used for the second stage of SR task. We further eliminate the potential latent space shift caused by the two-stage training strategy through the self-distilled truncation trick. The extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance to other SSIR methods on both public and private datasets. Code is released at https://github.com/goddesshs/TransMRSR.git .

**Title:** Multimodal Pathology Image Search Between H&E Slides and Multiplexed  Immunofluorescent Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06780  
**Abstract:** We present an approach for multimodal pathology image search, using dynamic time warping (DTW) on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space that is fed into a ranked choice voting scheme to retrieve multiplexed immunofluorescent imaging (mIF) that is most similar to a query H&E slide. Through training the VAE and applying DTW, we align and compare mIF and H&E slides. Our method improves differential diagnosis and therapeutic decisions by integrating morphological H&E data with immunophenotyping from mIF, providing clinicians a rich perspective of disease states. This facilitates an understanding of the spatial relationships in tissue samples and could revolutionize the diagnostic process, enhancing precision and enabling personalized therapy selection. Our technique demonstrates feasibility using colorectal cancer and healthy tonsil samples. An exhaustive ablation study was conducted on a search engine designed to explore the correlation between multiplexed Immunofluorescence (mIF) and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, in order to validate its ability to map these distinct modalities into a unified vector space. Despite extreme class imbalance, the system demonstrated robustness and utility by returning similar results across various data features, which suggests potential for future use in multimodal histopathology data analysis.

**Title:** HiddenSinger: High-Quality Singing Voice Synthesis via Neural Audio  Codec and Latent Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06814  
**Abstract:** Recently, denoising diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance among generative models in various domains. However, in the speech domain, the application of diffusion models for synthesizing time-varying audio faces limitations in terms of complexity and controllability, as speech synthesis requires very high-dimensional samples with long-term acoustic features. To alleviate the challenges posed by model complexity in singing voice synthesis, we propose HiddenSinger, a high-quality singing voice synthesis system using a neural audio codec and latent diffusion models. To ensure high-fidelity audio, we introduce an audio autoencoder that can encode audio into an audio codec as a compressed representation and reconstruct the high-fidelity audio from the low-dimensional compressed latent vector. Subsequently, we use the latent diffusion models to sample a latent representation from a musical score. In addition, our proposed model is extended to an unsupervised singing voice learning framework, HiddenSinger-U, to train the model using an unlabeled singing voice dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models in terms of audio quality. Furthermore, the HiddenSinger-U can synthesize high-quality singing voices of speakers trained solely on unlabeled data.

**Title:** Enhancing COVID-19 Diagnosis through Vision Transformer-Based Analysis  of Chest X-ray Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06914  
**Abstract:** The advent of 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has engendered a momentous global health crisis, necessitating the identification of the ailment in individuals through diverse diagnostic modalities. Radiological imaging, particularly the deployment of X-ray imaging, has been recognized as a pivotal instrument in the detection and characterization of COVID-19. Recent investigations have unveiled invaluable insights pertaining to the virus within X-ray images, instigating the exploration of methodologies aimed at augmenting diagnostic accuracy through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The current research endeavor posits an innovative framework for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, harnessing raw chest X-ray images, specifically by means of fine-tuning pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models. The developed models were appraised in terms of their binary classification performance, discerning COVID-19 from Normal cases, as well as their ternary classification performance, discriminating COVID-19 from Pneumonia and Normal instances, and lastly, their quaternary classification performance, discriminating COVID-19 from Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal conditions, employing distinct datasets. The proposed model evinced extraordinary precision, registering results of 99.92% and 99.84% for binary classification, 0.9795 and 86.48% for ternary classification, and 86.81% for quaternary classification, respectively, on the respective datasets.

**Title:** Multi-View Frequency-Attention Alternative to CNN Frontends for  Automatic Speech Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06954  
**Abstract:** Convolutional frontends are a typical choice for Transformer-based automatic speech recognition to preprocess the spectrogram, reduce its sequence length, and combine local information in time and frequency similarly. However, the width and height of an audio spectrogram denote different information, e.g., due to reverberation as well as the articulatory system, the time axis has a clear left-to-right dependency. On the contrary, vowels and consonants demonstrate very different patterns and occupy almost disjoint frequency ranges. Therefore, we hypothesize, global attention over frequencies is beneficial over local convolution. We obtain 2.4 % relative word error rate reduction (rWERR) on a production scale Conformer transducer replacing its convolutional neural network frontend by the proposed F-Attention module on Alexa traffic. To demonstrate generalizability, we validate this on public LibriSpeech data with a long short term memory-based listen attend and spell architecture obtaining 4.6 % rWERR and demonstrate robustness to (simulated) noisy conditions.
