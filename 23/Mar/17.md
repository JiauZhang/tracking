**Title:** Ask and You Shall Receive (a Graph Drawing): Testing ChatGPT's Potential  to Apply Graph Layout Algorithms  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08819

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently taken the world by storm. They can generate coherent text, hold meaningful conversations, and be taught concepts and basic sets of instructions - such as the steps of an algorithm. In this context, we are interested in exploring the application of LLMs to graph drawing algorithms by performing experiments on ChatGPT. These algorithms are used to improve the readability of graph visualizations. The probabilistic nature of LLMs presents challenges to implementing algorithms correctly, but we believe that LLMs' ability to learn from vast amounts of data and apply complex operations may lead to interesting graph drawing results. For example, we could enable users with limited coding backgrounds to use simple natural language to create effective graph visualizations. Natural language specification would make data visualization more accessible and user-friendly for a wider range of users. Exploring LLMs' capabilities for graph drawing can also help us better understand how to formulate complex algorithms for LLMs; a type of knowledge that could transfer to other areas of computer science. Overall, our goal is to shed light on the exciting possibilities of using LLMs for graph drawing while providing a balanced assessment of the challenges and opportunities they present.

**Title:** Class-Guided Image-to-Image Diffusion: Cell Painting from Brightfield  Images with Class Labels  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08863

**Abstract:** Image-to-image reconstruction problems with free or inexpensive metadata in the form of class labels appear often in biological and medical image domains. Existing text-guided or style-transfer image-to-image approaches do not translate to datasets where additional information is provided as discrete classes. We introduce and implement a model which combines image-to-image and class-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models. We train our model on a real-world dataset of microscopy images used for drug discovery, with and without incorporating metadata labels. By exploring the properties of image-to-image diffusion with relevant labels, we show that class-guided image-to-image diffusion can improve the meaningful content of the reconstructed images and outperform the unguided model in useful downstream tasks. 

**Title:** A Two-level GPU-Accelerated Incomplete LU Preconditioner for General  Sparse Linear Systems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08881

**Abstract:** This paper presents a parallel preconditioning approach based on incomplete LU (ILU) factorizations in the framework of Domain Decomposition (DD) for general sparse linear systems. We focus on distributed memory parallel architectures, specifically, those that are equipped with graphic processing units (GPUs). In addition to block Jacobi, we present general purpose two-level ILU Schur complement-based approaches, where different strategies are presented to solve the coarse-level reduced system. These strategies are combined with modified ILU methods in the construction of the coarse-level operator, in order to effectively remove smooth errors. We leverage available GPU-based sparse matrix kernels to accelerate the setup and the solve phases of the proposed ILU preconditioner. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods as a smoother for algebraic multigrid (AMG) and as a preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods, on challenging anisotropic diffusion problems and a collection of general sparse matrices. 

**Title:** Stochastic Segmentation with Conditional Categorical Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08888

**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation has made significant progress in recent years thanks to deep neural networks, but the common objective of generating a single segmentation output that accurately matches the image's content may not be suitable for safety-critical domains such as medical diagnostics and autonomous driving. Instead, multiple possible correct segmentation maps may be required to reflect the true distribution of annotation maps. In this context, stochastic semantic segmentation methods must learn to predict conditional distributions of labels given the image, but this is challenging due to the typically multimodal distributions, high-dimensional output spaces, and limited annotation data. To address these challenges, we propose a conditional categorical diffusion model (CCDM) for semantic segmentation based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Our model is conditioned to the input image, enabling it to generate multiple segmentation label maps that account for the aleatoric uncertainty arising from divergent ground truth annotations. Our experimental results show that CCDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIDC, a stochastic semantic segmentation dataset, and outperforms established baselines on the classical segmentation dataset Cityscapes. 

**Title:** ViTO: Vision Transformer-Operator  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08891

**Abstract:** We combine vision transformers with operator learning to solve diverse inverse problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach, named ViTO, combines a U-Net based architecture with a vision transformer. We apply ViTO to solve inverse PDE problems of increasing complexity, namely for the wave equation, the Navier-Stokes equations and the Darcy equation. We focus on the more challenging case of super-resolution, where the input dataset for the inverse problem is at a significantly coarser resolution than the output. The results we obtain are comparable or exceed the leading operator network benchmarks in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, ViTO`s architecture has a small number of trainable parameters (less than 10% of the leading competitor), resulting in a performance speed-up of over 5x when averaged over the various test cases. 

**Title:** SelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for  Generative Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08896

**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 are capable of generating highly fluent responses to a wide variety of user prompts. However, LLMs are known to hallucinate facts and make non-factual statements which can undermine trust in their output. Existing fact-checking approaches either require access to token-level output probability distribution (which may not be available for systems such as ChatGPT) or external databases that are interfaced via separate, often complex, modules. In this work, we propose "SelfCheckGPT", a simple sampling-based approach that can be used to fact-check black-box models in a zero-resource fashion, i.e. without an external database. SelfCheckGPT leverages the simple idea that if a LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by using GPT-3 to generate passages about individuals from the WikiBio dataset, and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate that SelfCheckGPT can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii) rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several existing baselines and show that in sentence hallucination detection, our approach has AUC-PR scores comparable to grey-box methods, while SelfCheckGPT is best at passage factuality assessment. 

**Title:** EgoViT: Pyramid Video Transformer for Egocentric Action Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08920

**Abstract:** Capturing interaction of hands with objects is important to autonomously detect human actions from egocentric videos. In this work, we present a pyramid video transformer with a dynamic class token generator for egocentric action recognition. Different from previous video transformers, which use the same static embedding as the class token for diverse inputs, we propose a dynamic class token generator that produces a class token for each input video by analyzing the hand-object interaction and the related motion information. The dynamic class token can diffuse such information to the entire model by communicating with other informative tokens in the subsequent transformer layers. With the dynamic class token, dissimilarity between videos can be more prominent, which helps the model distinguish various inputs. In addition, traditional video transformers explore temporal features globally, which requires large amounts of computation. However, egocentric videos often have a large amount of background scene transition, which causes discontinuities across distant frames. In this case, blindly reducing the temporal sampling rate will risk losing crucial information. Hence, we also propose a pyramid architecture to hierarchically process the video from short-term high rate to long-term low rate. With the proposed architecture, we significantly reduce the computational cost as well as the memory requirement without sacrificing from the model performance. We perform comparisons with different baseline video transformers on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model can efficiently improve the performance for egocentric action recognition. 

**Title:** Applying unsupervised keyphrase methods on concepts extracted from  discharge sheets  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08928

**Abstract:** Clinical notes containing valuable patient information are written by different health care providers with various scientific levels and writing styles. It might be helpful for clinicians and researchers to understand what information is essential when dealing with extensive electronic medical records. Entities recognizing and mapping them to standard terminologies is crucial in reducing ambiguity in processing clinical notes. Although named entity recognition and entity linking are critical steps in clinical natural language processing, they can also result in the production of repetitive and low-value concepts. In other hand, all parts of a clinical text do not share the same importance or content in predicting the patient's condition. As a result, it is necessary to identify the section in which each content is recorded and also to identify key concepts to extract meaning from clinical texts. In this study, these challenges have been addressed by using clinical natural language processing techniques. In addition, in order to identify key concepts, a set of popular unsupervised key phrase extraction methods has been verified and evaluated. Considering that most of the clinical concepts are in the form of multi-word expressions and their accurate identification requires the user to specify n-gram range, we have proposed a shortcut method to preserve the structure of the expression based on TF-IDF. In order to evaluate the pre-processing method and select the concepts, we have designed two types of downstream tasks (multiple and binary classification) using the capabilities of transformer-based models. The obtained results show the superiority of proposed method in combination with SciBERT model, also offer an insight into the efficacy of general extracting essential phrase methods for clinical notes. 

**Title:** Automated Interactive Domain-Specific Conversational Agents that  Understand Human Dialogs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08941

**Abstract:** Achieving human-like communication with machines remains a classic, challenging topic in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and Natural Language Processing. These Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on pattern-matching rather than a true understanding of the semantic meaning of a sentence. As a result, they may generate incorrect responses. To generate an assuredly correct response, one has to "understand" the semantics of a sentence. To achieve this "understanding", logic-based (commonsense) reasoning methods such as Answer Set Programming (ASP) are arguably needed. In this paper, we describe the AutoConcierge system that leverages LLMs and ASP to develop a conversational agent that can truly "understand" human dialogs in restricted domains. AutoConcierge is focused on a specific domain-advising users about restaurants in their local area based on their preferences. AutoConcierge will interactively understand a user's utterances, identify the missing information in them, and request the user via a natural language sentence to provide it. Once AutoConcierge has determined that all the information has been received, it computes a restaurant recommendation based on the user-preferences it has acquired from the human user. AutoConcierge is based on our STAR framework developed earlier, which uses GPT-3 to convert human dialogs into predicates that capture the deep structure of the dialog's sentence. These predicates are then input into the goal-directed s(CASP) ASP system for performing commonsense reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, AutoConcierge is the first automated conversational agent that can realistically converse like a human and provide help to humans based on truly understanding human utterances. 

**Title:** High order spatial discretization for variational time implicit schemes:  Wasserstein gradient flows and reaction-diffusion systems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08950

**Abstract:** We design and compute first-order implicit-in-time variational schemes with high-order spatial discretization for initial value gradient flows in generalized optimal transport metric spaces. We first review some examples of gradient flows in generalized optimal transport spaces from the Onsager principle. We then use a one-step time relaxation optimization problem for time-implicit schemes, namely generalized Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto schemes. Their minimizing systems satisfy implicit-in-time schemes for initial value gradient flows with first-order time accuracy. We adopt the first-order optimization scheme ALG2 (Augmented Lagrangian method) and high-order finite element methods in spatial discretization to compute the one-step optimization problem. This allows us to derive the implicit-in-time update of initial value gradient flows iteratively. We remark that the iteration in ALG2 has a simple-to-implement point-wise update based on optimal transport and Onsager's activation functions. The proposed method is unconditionally stable for convex cases. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods in two-dimensional PDEs, including Wasserstein gradient flows, Fisher--Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation, and two and four species reversible reaction-diffusion systems. 

**Title:** Reinforce Data, Multiply Impact: Improved Model Accuracy and Robustness  with Dataset Reinforcement  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08983

**Abstract:** We propose Dataset Reinforcement, a strategy to improve a dataset once such that the accuracy of any model architecture trained on the reinforced dataset is improved at no additional training cost for users. We propose a Dataset Reinforcement strategy based on data augmentation and knowledge distillation. Our generic strategy is designed based on extensive analysis across CNN- and transformer-based models and performing large-scale study of distillation with state-of-the-art models with various data augmentations. We create a reinforced version of the ImageNet training dataset, called ImageNet+, as well as reinforced datasets CIFAR-100+, Flowers-102+, and Food-101+. Models trained with ImageNet+ are more accurate, robust, and calibrated, and transfer well to downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation and detection). As an example, the accuracy of ResNet-50 improves by 1.7% on the ImageNet validation set, 3.5% on ImageNetV2, and 10.0% on ImageNet-R. Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on the ImageNet validation set is also reduced by 9.9%. Using this backbone with Mask-RCNN for object detection on MS-COCO, the mean average precision improves by 0.8%. We reach similar gains for MobileNets, ViTs, and Swin-Transformers. For MobileNetV3 and Swin-Tiny we observe significant improvements on ImageNet-R/A/C of up to 10% improved robustness. Models pretrained on ImageNet+ and fine-tuned on CIFAR-100+, Flowers-102+, and Food-101+, reach up to 3.4% improved accuracy. 

**Title:** Conditional Synthetic Food Image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09005

**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been widely investigated for image synthesis based on their powerful representation learning ability. In this work, we explore the StyleGAN and its application of synthetic food image generation. Despite the impressive performance of GAN for natural image generation, food images suffer from high intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity, resulting in overfitting and visual artifacts for synthetic images. Therefore, we aim to explore the capability and improve the performance of GAN methods for food image generation. Specifically, we first choose StyleGAN3 as the baseline method to generate synthetic food images and analyze the performance. Then, we identify two issues that can cause performance degradation on food images during the training phase: (1) inter-class feature entanglement during multi-food classes training and (2) loss of high-resolution detail during image downsampling. To address both issues, we propose to train one food category at a time to avoid feature entanglement and leverage image patches cropped from high-resolution datasets to retain fine details. We evaluate our method on the Food-101 dataset and show improved quality of generated synthetic food images compared with the baseline. Finally, we demonstrate the great potential of improving the performance of downstream tasks, such as food image classification by including high-quality synthetic training samples in the data augmentation. 

**Title:** Mimic3D: Thriving 3D-Aware GANs via 3D-to-2D Imitation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09036

**Abstract:** Generating images with both photorealism and multiview 3D consistency is crucial for 3D-aware GANs, yet existing methods struggle to achieve them simultaneously. Improving the photorealism via CNN-based 2D super-resolution can break the strict 3D consistency, while keeping the 3D consistency by learning high-resolution 3D representations for direct rendering often compromises image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel learning strategy, namely 3D-to-2D imitation, which enables a 3D-aware GAN to generate high-quality images while maintaining their strict 3D consistency, by letting the images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic those generated by its 2D super-resolution branch. We also introduce 3D-aware convolutions into the generator for better 3D representation learning, which further improves the image generation quality. With the above strategies, our method reaches FID scores of 5.4 and 4.3 on FFHQ and AFHQ-v2 Cats, respectively, at 512x512 resolution, largely outperforming existing 3D-aware GANs using direct 3D rendering and coming very close to the previous state-of-the-art method that leverages 2D super-resolution.

**Title:** Translating Radiology Reports into Plain Language using ChatGPT and  GPT-4 with Prompt Learning: Promising Results, Limitations, and Potential  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09038

**Abstract:** The large language model called ChatGPT has drawn extensively attention because of its human-like expression and reasoning abilities. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using ChatGPT in experiments on using ChatGPT to translate radiology reports into plain language for patients and healthcare providers so that they are educated for improved healthcare. Radiology reports from 62 low-dose chest CT lung cancer screening scans and 76 brain MRI metastases screening scans were collected in the first half of February for this study. According to the evaluation by radiologists, ChatGPT can successfully translate radiology reports into plain language with an average score of 4.1 in the five-point system with 0.07 places of information missing and 0.11 places of misinformation. In terms of the suggestions provided by ChatGPT, they are general relevant such as keeping following-up with doctors and closely monitoring any symptoms, and for about 37% of 138 cases in total ChatGPT offers specific suggestions based on findings in the report. ChatGPT also presents some randomness in its responses with occasionally over-simplified or neglected information, which can be mitigated using a more detailed prompt. Furthermore, ChatGPT results are compared with a newly released large model GPT-4, showing that GPT-4 can significantly improve the quality of translated reports. Our results show that it is feasible to utilize large language models in clinical education, and further efforts are needed to address limitations and maximize their potential. 

**Title:** Hybrid Spectral Denoising Transformer with Learnable Query  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09040

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a Hybrid Spectral Denoising Transformer (HSDT) for hyperspectral image denoising. Challenges in adapting transformer for HSI arise from the capabilities to tackle existing limitations of CNN-based methods in capturing the global and local spatial-spectral correlations while maintaining efficiency and flexibility. To address these issues, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both models with a Spatial-Spectral Separable Convolution (S3Conv), Guided Spectral Self-Attention (GSSA), and Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (SM-FFN). Our S3Conv works as a lightweight alternative to 3D convolution, which extracts more spatial-spectral correlated features while keeping the flexibility to tackle HSIs with an arbitrary number of bands. These features are then adaptively processed by GSSA which per-forms 3D self-attention across the spectral bands, guided by a set of learnable queries that encode the spectral signatures. This not only enriches our model with powerful capabilities for identifying global spectral correlations but also maintains linear complexity. Moreover, our SM-FFN proposes the self-modulation that intensifies the activations of more informative regions, which further strengthens the aggregated features. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets under both simulated and real-world noise, and it shows that our HSDT significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational overhead. 

**Title:** Robust Evaluation of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09051

**Abstract:** We question the current evaluation practice on diffusion-based purification methods. Diffusion-based purification methods aim to remove adversarial effects from an input data point at test time. The approach gains increasing attention as an alternative to adversarial training due to the disentangling between training and testing. Well-known white-box attacks are often employed to measure the robustness of the purification. However, it is unknown whether these attacks are the most effective for the diffusion-based purification since the attacks are often tailored for adversarial training. We analyze the current practices and provide a new guideline for measuring the robustness of purification methods against adversarial attacks. Based on our analysis, we further propose a new purification strategy showing competitive results against the state-of-the-art adversarial training approaches. 

**Title:** Combined Machine Learning and Physics-Based Forecaster for Intra-day and  1-Week Ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting Under Variable Weather Conditions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09073

**Abstract:** Power systems engineers are actively developing larger power plants out of photovoltaics imposing some major challenges which include its intermittent power generation and its poor dispatchability. The issue is that PV is a variable generation source unless additional planning and system additions for mitigation of generation intermittencies. One underlying factor that can enhance the applications around mitigating distributed energy resource intermittency challenges is forecasting the generation output. This is challenging especially with renewable energy sources which are weather dependent as due to the random nature of weather variance. This work puts forth a forecasting model which uses the solar variables to produce a PV generation forecast and evaluates a set of machine learning models for this task. In this paper, a forecaster for irradiance prediction for intra-day is proposed. This forecaster is capable of forecasting 15 minutes and hourly irradiance up to one week ahead. The paper performed a correlation and sensitivity analysis of the strength of the relationship between local weather parameters and system generation. In this study performance of SVM, CART, ANN, and Ensemble learning were analyzed for the prediction of 15-minute intraday and day-ahead irradiance. The results show that SVM and Ensemble learning yielded the lowest MAE for 15-minute intraday and day-ahead irradiance, respectively. 

**Title:** Taming Diffusion Models for Audio-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09119

**Abstract:** Animating virtual avatars to make co-speech gestures facilitates various applications in human-machine interaction. The existing methods mainly rely on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which typically suffer from notorious mode collapse and unstable training, thus making it difficult to learn accurate audio-gesture joint distributions. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework, named Diffusion Co-Speech Gesture (DiffGesture), to effectively capture the cross-modal audio-to-gesture associations and preserve temporal coherence for high-fidelity audio-driven co-speech gesture generation. Specifically, we first establish the diffusion-conditional generation process on clips of skeleton sequences and audio to enable the whole framework. Then, a novel Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer is devised to better attend to the information from multiple modalities and model the long-term temporal dependency. Moreover, to eliminate temporal inconsistency, we propose an effective Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer with an annealed noise sampling strategy. Benefiting from the architectural advantages of diffusion models, we further incorporate implicit classifier-free guidance to trade off between diversity and gesture quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffGesture achieves state-of-theart performance, which renders coherent gestures with better mode coverage and stronger audio correlations. Code is available at https://github.com/Advocate99/DiffGesture. 

**Title:** Fiber Tract Shape Measures Inform Prediction of Non-Imaging Phenotypes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09124

**Abstract:** Neuroimaging measures of the brain's white matter connections can enable the prediction of non-imaging phenotypes, such as demographic and cognitive measures. Existing works have investigated traditional microstructure and connectivity measures from diffusion MRI tractography, without considering the shape of the connections reconstructed by tractography. In this paper, we investigate the potential of fiber tract shape features for predicting non-imaging phenotypes, both individually and in combination with traditional features. We focus on three basic shape features: length, diameter, and elongation. Two different prediction methods are used, including a traditional regression method and a deep-learning-based prediction method. Experiments use an efficient two-stage fusion strategy for prediction using microstructure, connectivity, and shape measures. To reduce predictive bias due to brain size, normalized shape features are also investigated. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) young adult dataset (n=1065) demonstrate that individual shape features are predictive of non-imaging phenotypes. When combined with microstructure and connectivity features, shape features significantly improve performance for predicting the cognitive score TPVT (NIH Toolbox picture vocabulary test). Overall, this study demonstrates that the shape of fiber tracts contains useful information for the description and study of the living human brain using machine learning. 

**Title:** Facial Affect Recognition based on Transformer Encoder and Audiovisual  Fusion for the ABAW5 Challenge  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09158

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present our solutions for the 5th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW), which includes four sub-challenges of Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation, Expression (Expr) Classification, Action Unit (AU) Detection and Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation. The 5th ABAW competition focuses on facial affect recognition utilizing different modalities and datasets. In our work, we extract powerful audio and visual features using a large number of sota models. These features are fused by Transformer Encoder and TEMMA. Besides, to avoid the possible impact of large dimensional differences between various features, we design an Affine Module to align different features to the same dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed method. For the VA Estimation sub-challenge, our method obtains the mean Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.6066. For the Expression Classification sub-challenge, the average F1 Score is 0.4055. For the AU Detection sub-challenge, the average F1 Score is 0.5296. For the Emotional Reaction Intensity Estimation sub-challenge, the average pearson's correlations coefficient on the validation set is 0.3968. All of the results of four sub-challenges outperform the baseline with a large margin. 

**Title:** Emotional Reaction Intensity Estimation Based on Multimodal Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09167

**Abstract:** This paper introduces our method for the Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation Challenge, in CVPR 2023: 5th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW). Based on the multimodal data provided by the originazers, we extract acoustic and visual features with different pretrained models. The multimodal features are mixed together by Transformer Encoders with cross-modal attention mechnism. In this paper, 1. better features are extracted with the SOTA pretrained models. 2. Compared with the baseline, we improve the Pearson's Correlations Coefficient a lot. 3. We process the data with some special skills to enhance performance ability of our model. 

**Title:** Global Knowledge Calibration for Fast Open-Vocabulary Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09181

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain. 

**Title:** Block-wise Bit-Compression of Transformer-based Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09184

**Abstract:** With the popularity of the recent Transformer-based models represented by BERT, GPT-3 and ChatGPT, there has been state-of-the-art performance in a range of natural language processing tasks. However, the massive computations, huge memory footprint, and thus high latency of Transformer-based models is an inevitable challenge for the cloud with high real-time requirement. To tackle the issue, we propose BBCT, a method of block-wise bit-compression for transformer without retraining. Our method achieves more fine-grained compression of the whole transformer, including embedding, matrix multiplication, GELU, softmax, layer normalization, and all the intermediate results. As a case, we compress an efficient BERT with the method of BBCT. Our benchmark test results on General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) show that BBCT can achieve less than 1% accuracy drop in most tasks. 

**Title:** PSVT: End-to-End Multi-person 3D Pose and Shape Estimation with  Progressive Video Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09187

**Abstract:** Existing methods of multi-person video 3D human Pose and Shape Estimation (PSE) typically adopt a two-stage strategy, which first detects human instances in each frame and then performs single-person PSE with temporal model. However, the global spatio-temporal context among spatial instances can not be captured. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end multi-person 3D Pose and Shape estimation framework with progressive Video Transformer, termed PSVT. In PSVT, a spatio-temporal encoder (STE) captures the global feature dependencies among spatial objects. Then, spatio-temporal pose decoder (STPD) and shape decoder (STSD) capture the global dependencies between pose queries and feature tokens, shape queries and feature tokens, respectively. To handle the variances of objects as time proceeds, a novel scheme of progressive decoding is used to update pose and shape queries at each frame. Besides, we propose a novel pose-guided attention (PGA) for shape decoder to better predict shape parameters. The two components strengthen the decoder of PSVT to improve performance. Extensive experiments on the four datasets show that PSVT achieves stage-of-the-art results. 

**Title:** A Framework for Real-time Object Detection and Image Restoration  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09190

**Abstract:** Object detection and single image super-resolution are classic problems in computer vision (CV). The object detection task aims to recognize the objects in input images, while the image restoration task aims to reconstruct high quality images from given low quality images. In this paper, a two-stage framework for object detection and image restoration is proposed. The first stage uses YOLO series algorithms to complete the object detection and then performs image cropping. In the second stage, this work improves Swin Transformer and uses the new proposed algorithm to connect the Swin Transformer layer to design a new neural network architecture. We name the newly proposed network for image restoration SwinOIR. This work compares the model performance of different versions of YOLO detection algorithms on MS COCO dataset and Pascal VOC dataset, demonstrating the suitability of different YOLO network models for the first stage of the framework in different scenarios. For image super-resolution task, it compares the model performance of using different methods of connecting Swin Transformer layers and design different sizes of SwinOIR for use in different life scenarios. Our implementation code is released at https://github.com/Rubbbbbbbbby/SwinOIR. 

**Title:** Cross-head Supervision for Crowd Counting with Noisy Annotations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09245

**Abstract:** Noisy annotations such as missing annotations and location shifts often exist in crowd counting datasets due to multi-scale head sizes, high occlusion, etc. These noisy annotations severely affect the model training, especially for density map-based methods. To alleviate the negative impact of noisy annotations, we propose a novel crowd counting model with one convolution head and one transformer head, in which these two heads can supervise each other in noisy areas, called Cross-Head Supervision. The resultant model, CHS-Net, can synergize different types of inductive biases for better counting. In addition, we develop a progressive cross-head supervision learning strategy to stabilize the training process and provide more reliable supervision. Extensive experimental results on ShanghaiTech and QNRF datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/RaccoonDML/CHSNet. 

**Title:** GridCLIP: One-Stage Object Detection by Grid-Level CLIP Representation  Learning

**Abstract:** A vision-language foundation model pretrained on very large-scale image-text paired data has the potential to provide generalizable knowledge representation for downstream visual recognition and detection tasks, especially on supplementing the undersampled categories in downstream model training. Recent studies utilizing CLIP for object detection have shown that a two-stage detector design typically outperforms a one-stage detector, while requiring more expensive training resources and longer inference time. In this work, we propose a one-stage detector GridCLIP that narrows its performance gap to those of two-stage detectors, with approximately 43 and 5 times faster than its two-stage counterpart (ViLD) in the training and test process respectively. GridCLIP learns grid-level representations to adapt to the intrinsic principle of one-stage detection learning by expanding the conventional CLIP image-text holistic mapping to a more fine-grained, grid-text alignment. This differs from the region-text mapping in two-stage detectors that apply CLIP directly by treating regions as images. Specifically, GridCLIP performs Grid-level Alignment to adapt the CLIP image-level representations to grid-level representations by aligning to CLIP category representations to learn the annotated (especially frequent) categories. To learn generalizable visual representations of broader categories, especially undersampled ones, we perform Image-level Alignment during training to propagate broad pre-learned categories in the CLIP image encoder from the image-level to the grid-level representations. Experiments show that the learned CLIP-based grid-level representations boost the performance of undersampled (infrequent and novel) categories, reaching comparable detection performance on the LVIS benchmark. 

**Title:** SmartBERT: A Promotion of Dynamic Early Exiting Mechanism for  Accelerating BERT Inference  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09266

**Abstract:** Dynamic early exiting has been proven to improve the inference speed of the pre-trained language model like BERT. However, all samples must go through all consecutive layers before early exiting and more complex samples usually go through more layers, which still exists redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic early exiting combined with layer skipping for BERT inference named SmartBERT, which adds a skipping gate and an exiting operator into each layer of BERT. SmartBERT can adaptively skip some layers and adaptively choose whether to exit. Besides, we propose cross-layer contrastive learning and combine it into our training phases to boost the intermediate layers and classifiers which would be beneficial for early exiting. To keep the consistent usage of skipping gates between training and inference phases, we propose a hard weight mechanism during training phase. We conduct experiments on eight classification datasets of the GLUE benchmark. Experimental results show that SmartBERT achieves 2-3x computation reduction with minimal accuracy drops compared with BERT and our method outperforms previous methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, in some complex datasets like RTE and WNLI, we prove that the early exiting based on entropy hardly works, and the skipping mechanism is essential for reducing computation. 

**Title:** StylerDALLE: Language-Guided Style Transfer Using a Vector-Quantized  Tokenizer of a Large-Scale Generative Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09268

**Abstract:** Despite the progress made in the style transfer task, most previous work focus on transferring only relatively simple features like color or texture, while missing more abstract concepts such as overall art expression or painter-specific traits. However, these abstract semantics can be captured by models like DALL-E or CLIP, which have been trained using huge datasets of images and textual documents. In this paper, we propose StylerDALLE, a style transfer method that exploits both of these models and uses natural language to describe abstract art styles. Specifically, we formulate the language-guided style transfer task as a non-autoregressive token sequence translation, i.e., from input content image to output stylized image, in the discrete latent space of a large-scale pretrained vector-quantized tokenizer. To incorporate style information, we propose a Reinforcement Learning strategy with CLIP-based language supervision that ensures stylization and content preservation simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which can effectively transfer art styles using language instructions at different granularities. Code is available at https://github.com/zipengxuc/StylerDALLE. 

**Title:** ELFIS: Expert Learning for Fine-grained Image Recognition Using Subsets  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09269

**Abstract:** Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) tackles the problem of distinguishing highly similar categories. One of the main approaches to FGVR, namely subset learning, tries to leverage information from existing class taxonomies to improve the performance of deep neural networks. However, these methods rely on the existence of handcrafted hierarchies that are not necessarily optimal for the models. In this paper, we propose ELFIS, an expert learning framework for FGVR that clusters categories of the dataset into meta-categories using both dataset-inherent lexical and model-specific information. A set of neural networks-based experts are trained focusing on the meta-categories and are integrated into a multi-task framework. Extensive experimentation shows improvements in the SoTA FGVR benchmarks of up to +1.3% of accuracy using both CNNs and transformer-based networks. Overall, the obtained results evidence that ELFIS can be applied on top of any classification model, enabling the obtention of SoTA results. The source code will be made public soon. 

**Title:** SpectralCLIP: Preventing Artifacts in Text-Guided Style Transfer from a  Spectral Perspective  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09270

**Abstract:** Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) has refreshed the state of the art for a broad range of vision-language cross-modal tasks. Particularly, it has created an intriguing research line of text-guided image style transfer, dispensing with the need for style reference images as in traditional style transfer methods. However, directly using CLIP to guide the transfer of style leads to undesirable artifacts (mainly written words and unrelated visual entities) spread over the image, partly due to the entanglement of visual and written concepts inherent in CLIP. Inspired by the use of spectral analysis in filtering linguistic information at different granular levels, we analyse the patch embeddings from the last layer of the CLIP vision encoder from the perspective of spectral analysis and find that the presence of undesirable artifacts is highly correlated to some certain frequency components. We propose SpectralCLIP, which implements a spectral filtering layer on top of the CLIP vision encoder, to alleviate the artifact issue. Experimental results show that SpectralCLIP prevents the generation of artifacts effectively in quantitative and qualitative terms, without impairing the stylisation quality. We further apply SpectralCLIP to text-conditioned image generation and show that it prevents written words in the generated images. Code is available at https://github.com/zipengxuc/SpectralCLIP. 

**Title:** Copyright Protection and Accountability of Generative AI:Attack,  Watermarking and Attribution  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09272

**Abstract:** Generative AI (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs) has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, Generative AI introduces significant concerns regarding the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (resp. model accountability) pertaining to images (resp. toxic images) and models (resp. poisoned models) generated. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the copyright protection measures for GANs, evaluate their performance across a diverse range of GAN architectures, and identify the factors that affect their performance and future research directions. Our findings indicate that the current IPR protection methods for input images, model watermarking, and attribution networks are largely satisfactory for a wide range of GANs. We highlight that further attention must be directed towards protecting training sets, as the current approaches fail to provide robust IPR protection and provenance tracing on training sets. 

**Title:** SpatialFormer: Semantic and Target Aware Attentions for Few-Shot  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09281

**Abstract:** Recent Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods put emphasis on generating a discriminative embedding features to precisely measure the similarity between support and query sets. Current CNN-based cross-attention approaches generate discriminative representations via enhancing the mutually semantic similar regions of support and query pairs. However, it suffers from two problems: CNN structure produces inaccurate attention map based on local features, and mutually similar backgrounds cause distraction. To alleviate these problems, we design a novel SpatialFormer structure to generate more accurate attention regions based on global features. Different from the traditional Transformer modeling intrinsic instance-level similarity which causes accuracy degradation in FSL, our SpatialFormer explores the semantic-level similarity between pair inputs to boost the performance. Then we derive two specific attention modules, named SpatialFormer Semantic Attention (SFSA) and SpatialFormer Target Attention (SFTA), to enhance the target object regions while reduce the background distraction. Particularly, SFSA highlights the regions with same semantic information between pair features, and SFTA finds potential foreground object regions of novel feature that are similar to base categories. Extensive experiments show that our methods are effective and achieve new state-of-the-art results on few-shot classification benchmarks. 

**Title:** A transformer-based approach to video frame-level prediction in  Affective Behaviour Analysis In-the-wild  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09293

**Abstract:** In recent years, transformer architecture has been a dominating paradigm in many applications, including affective computing. In this report, we propose our transformer-based model to handle Emotion Classification Task in the 5th Affective Behavior Analysis In-the-wild Competition. By leveraging the attentive model and the synthetic dataset, we attain a score of 0.4775 on the validation set of Aff-Wild2, the dataset provided by the organizer. 

**Title:** DIRE for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09295

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual synthesis, but have also raised concerns about potential abuse for malicious purposes. In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/DIRE. 

**Title:** Towards Robust Bangla Complex Named Entity Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09306

**Abstract:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text. But much work hasn't been done for complex named entity recognition in Bangla, despite being the seventh most spoken language globally. CNER is a more challenging task than traditional NER as it involves identifying and classifying complex and compound entities, which are not common in Bangla language. In this paper, we present the winning solution of Bangla Complex Named Entity Recognition Challenge - addressing the CNER task on BanglaCoNER dataset using two different approaches, namely Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and finetuning transformer based Deep Learning models such as BanglaBERT. 

**Title:** Depth Super-Resolution from Explicit and Implicit High-Frequency  Features  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09307

**Abstract:** We propose a novel multi-stage depth super-resolution network, which progressively reconstructs high-resolution depth maps from explicit and implicit high-frequency features. The former are extracted by an efficient transformer processing both local and global contexts, while the latter are obtained by projecting color images into the frequency domain. Both are combined together with depth features by means of a fusion strategy within a multi-stage and multi-scale framework. Experiments on the main benchmarks, such as NYUv2, Middlebury, DIML and RGBDD, show that our approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin (~20% on NYUv2 and DIML against the contemporary work DADA, with 16x upsampling), establishing a new state-of-the-art in the guided depth super-resolution task. 

**Title:** Unified Multi-Modal Latent Diffusion for Joint Subject and Text  Conditional Image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09319

**Abstract:** Language-guided image generation has achieved great success nowadays by using diffusion models. However, texts can be less detailed to describe highly-specific subjects such as a particular dog or a certain car, which makes pure text-to-image generation not accurate enough to satisfy user requirements. In this work, we present a novel Unified Multi-Modal Latent Diffusion (UMM-Diffusion) which takes joint texts and images containing specified subjects as input sequences and generates customized images with the subjects. To be more specific, both input texts and images are encoded into one unified multi-modal latent space, in which the input images are learned to be projected to pseudo word embedding and can be further combined with text to guide image generation. Besides, to eliminate the irrelevant parts of the input images such as background or illumination, we propose a novel sampling technique of diffusion models used by the image generator which fuses the results guided by multi-modal input and pure text input. By leveraging the large-scale pre-trained text-to-image generator and the designed image encoder, our method is able to generate high-quality images with complex semantics from both aspects of input texts and images. 

**Title:** Can Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) Pass Assessments in Higher  Education Programming Courses?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09325

**Abstract:** We evaluated the capability of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), to pass assessments in introductory and intermediate Python programming courses at the postsecondary level. Discussions of potential uses (e.g., exercise generation, code explanation) and misuses (e.g., cheating) of this emerging technology in programming education have intensified, but to date there has not been a rigorous analysis of the models' capabilities in the realistic context of a full-fledged programming course with diverse set of assessment instruments. We evaluated GPT on three Python courses that employ assessments ranging from simple multiple-choice questions (no code involved) to complex programming projects with code bases distributed into multiple files (599 exercises overall). Further, we studied if and how successfully GPT models leverage feedback provided by an auto-grader. We found that the current models are not capable of passing the full spectrum of assessments typically involved in a Python programming course (<70% on even entry-level modules). Yet, it is clear that a straightforward application of these easily accessible models could enable a learner to obtain a non-trivial portion of the overall available score (>55%) in introductory and intermediate courses alike. While the models exhibit remarkable capabilities, including correcting solutions based on auto-grader's feedback, some limitations exist (e.g., poor handling of exercises requiring complex chains of reasoning steps). These findings can be leveraged by instructors wishing to adapt their assessments so that GPT becomes a valuable assistant for a learner as opposed to an end-to-end solution. 

**Title:** DINAR: Diffusion Inpainting of Neural Textures for One-Shot Human  Avatars  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09375

**Abstract:** We present DINAR, an approach for creating realistic rigged fullbody avatars from single RGB images. Similarly to previous works, our method uses neural textures combined with the SMPL-X body model to achieve photo-realistic quality of avatars while keeping them easy to animate and fast to infer. To restore the texture, we use a latent diffusion model and show how such model can be trained in the neural texture space. The use of the diffusion model allows us to realistically reconstruct large unseen regions such as the back of a person given the frontal view. The models in our pipeline are trained using 2D images and videos only. In the experiments, our approach achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and good generalization to new poses and viewpoints. In particular, the approach improves state-of-the-art on the SnapshotPeople public benchmark. 

**Title:** Predicting Human Attention using Computational Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09383

**Abstract:** Most models of visual attention are aimed at predicting either top-down or bottom-up control, as studied using different visual search and free-viewing tasks. We propose Human Attention Transformer (HAT), a single model predicting both forms of attention control. HAT is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in predicting the scanpath of fixations made during target-present and target-absent search, and matches or exceeds SOTA in the prediction of taskless free-viewing fixation scanpaths. HAT achieves this new SOTA by using a novel transformer-based architecture and a simplified foveated retina that collectively create a spatio-temporal awareness akin to the dynamic visual working memory of humans. Unlike previous methods that rely on a coarse grid of fixation cells and experience information loss due to fixation discretization, HAT features a dense-prediction architecture and outputs a dense heatmap for each fixation, thus avoiding discretizing fixations. HAT sets a new standard in computational attention, which emphasizes both effectiveness and generality. HAT's demonstrated scope and applicability will likely inspire the development of new attention models that can better predict human behavior in various attention-demanding scenarios. 

**Title:** Text-to-ECG: 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Synthesis conditioned on Clinical  Text Reports  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09395

**Abstract:** Electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis is the area of research focused on generating realistic synthetic ECG signals for medical use without concerns over annotation costs or clinical data privacy restrictions. Traditional ECG generation models consider a single ECG lead and utilize GAN-based generative models. These models can only generate single lead samples and require separate training for each diagnosis class. The diagnosis classes of ECGs are insufficient to capture the intricate differences between ECGs depending on various features (e.g. patient demographic details, co-existing diagnosis classes, etc.). To alleviate these challenges, we present a text-to-ECG task, in which textual inputs are used to produce ECG outputs. Then we propose Auto-TTE, an autoregressive generative model conditioned on clinical text reports to synthesize 12-lead ECGs, for the first time to our knowledge. We compare the performance of our model with other representative models in text-to-speech and text-to-image. Experimental results show the superiority of our model in various quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis. Finally, we conduct a user study with three board-certified cardiologists to confirm the fidelity and semantic alignment of generated samples. our code will be available at https://github.com/TClife/text_to_ecg 

**Title:** ToxVis: Enabling Interpretability of Implicit vs. Explicit Toxicity  Detection Models with Interactive Visualization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09402

**Abstract:** The rise of hate speech on online platforms has led to an urgent need for effective content moderation. However, the subjective and multi-faceted nature of hateful online content, including implicit hate speech, poses significant challenges to human moderators and content moderation systems. To address this issue, we developed ToxVis, a visually interactive and explainable tool for classifying hate speech into three categories: implicit, explicit, and non-hateful. We fine-tuned two transformer-based models using RoBERTa, XLNET, and GPT-3 and used deep learning interpretation techniques to provide explanations for the classification results. ToxVis enables users to input potentially hateful text and receive a classification result along with a visual explanation of which words contributed most to the decision. By making the classification process explainable, ToxVis provides a valuable tool for understanding the nuances of hateful content and supporting more effective content moderation. Our research contributes to the growing body of work aimed at mitigating the harms caused by online hate speech and demonstrates the potential for combining state-of-the-art natural language processing models with interpretable deep learning techniques to address this critical issue. Finally, ToxVis can serve as a resource for content moderators, social media platforms, and researchers working to combat the spread of hate speech online. 

**Title:** NeRFtrinsic Four: An End-To-End Trainable NeRF Jointly Optimizing  Diverse Intrinsic and Extrinsic Camera Parameters  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09412

**Abstract:** Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRF) is the state-of-the-art technique for generating high-quality images from novel viewpoints. Existing methods require a priori knowledge about extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. This limits their applicability to synthetic scenes, or real-world scenarios with the necessity of a preprocessing step. Current research on the joint optimization of camera parameters and NeRF focuses on refining noisy extrinsic camera parameters and often relies on the preprocessing of intrinsic camera parameters. Further approaches are limited to cover only one single camera intrinsic. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable approach called NeRFtrinsic Four. We utilize Gaussian Fourier features to estimate extrinsic camera parameters and dynamically predict varying intrinsic camera parameters through the supervision of the projection error. Our approach outperforms existing joint optimization methods on LLFF and BLEFF. In addition to these existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset called iFF with varying intrinsic camera parameters. NeRFtrinsic Four is a step forward in joint optimization NeRF-based view synthesis and enables more realistic and flexible rendering in real-world scenarios with varying camera parameters. 

**Title:** NeRFMeshing: Distilling Neural Radiance Fields into  Geometrically-Accurate 3D Meshes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09431

**Abstract:** With the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), novel view synthesis has recently made a big leap forward. At the core, NeRF proposes that each 3D point can emit radiance, allowing to conduct view synthesis using differentiable volumetric rendering. While neural radiance fields can accurately represent 3D scenes for computing the image rendering, 3D meshes are still the main scene representation supported by most computer graphics and simulation pipelines, enabling tasks such as real time rendering and physics-based simulations. Obtaining 3D meshes from neural radiance fields still remains an open challenge since NeRFs are optimized for view synthesis, not enforcing an accurate underlying geometry on the radiance field. We thus propose a novel compact and flexible architecture that enables easy 3D surface reconstruction from any NeRF-driven approach. Upon having trained the radiance field, we distill the volumetric 3D representation into a Signed Surface Approximation Network, allowing easy extraction of the 3D mesh and appearance. Our final 3D mesh is physically accurate and can be rendered in real time on an array of devices. 

**Title:** Jump to Conclusions: Short-Cutting Transformers With Linear  Transformations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09435

**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) create hidden representations of their inputs at every layer, but only use final-layer representations for prediction. This obscures the internal decision-making process of the model and the utility of its intermediate representations. One way to elucidate this is to cast the hidden representations as final representations, bypassing the transformer computation in-between. In this work, we suggest a simple method for such casting, by using linear transformations. We show that our approach produces more accurate approximations than the prevailing practice of inspecting hidden representations from all layers in the space of the final layer. Moreover, in the context of language modeling, our method allows "peeking" into early layer representations of GPT-2 and BERT, showing that often LMs already predict the final output in early layers. We then demonstrate the practicality of our method to recent early exit strategies, showing that when aiming, for example, at retention of 95% accuracy, our approach saves additional 7.9% layers for GPT-2 and 5.4% layers for BERT, on top of the savings of the original approach. Last, we extend our method to linearly approximate sub-modules, finding that attention is most tolerant to this change. 

**Title:** Steering Prototype with Prompt-tuning for Rehearsal-free Continual  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09447

**Abstract:** Prototype, as a representation of class embeddings, has been explored to reduce memory footprint or mitigate forgetting for continual learning scenarios. However, prototype-based methods still suffer from abrupt performance deterioration due to semantic drift and prototype interference. In this study, we propose Contrastive Prototypical Prompt (CPP) and show that task-specific prompt-tuning, when optimized over a contrastive learning objective, can effectively address both obstacles and significantly improve the potency of prototypes. Our experiments demonstrate that CPP excels in four challenging class-incremental learning benchmarks, resulting in 4% to 6% absolute improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, CPP does not require a rehearsal buffer and it largely bridges the performance gap between continual learning and offline joint-learning, showcasing a promising design scheme for continual learning systems under a Transformer architecture. 

**Title:** ChatGPT Participates in a Computer Science Exam  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09461

**Abstract:** We asked ChatGPT to participate in an undergraduate computer science exam on ''Algorithms and Data Structures''. We evaluated the program on the entire exam as posed to the students. We hand-copied its answers onto an exam sheet, which was subsequently graded in a blind setup alongside those of 200 participating students. We find that ChatGPT narrowly passed the exam, obtaining 20.5 out of 40 points. This impressive performance indicates that ChatGPT can indeed succeed in challenging tasks like university exams. At the same time, the tasks in our exam are structurally similar to those on other exams, solved homework problems, and teaching materials that can be found online. Therefore, it would be premature to conclude from this experiment that ChatGPT has any understanding of computer science. The transcript of our conversation with ChatGPT is available at \url{https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/chatgpt-algorithm-exam}, and the entire graded exam is in the appendix of this paper. 

**Title:** DiffIR: Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09472

**Abstract:** Diffusion model (DM) has achieved SOTA performance by modeling the image synthesis process into a sequential application of a denoising network. However, different from image synthesis generating each pixel from scratch, most pixels of image restoration (IR) are given. Thus, for IR, traditional DMs running massive iterations on a large model to estimate whole images or feature maps is inefficient. To address this issue, we propose an efficient DM for IR (DiffIR), which consists of a compact IR prior extraction network (CPEN), dynamic IR transformer (DIRformer), and denoising network. Specifically, DiffIR has two training stages: pretraining and training DM. In pretraining, we input ground-truth images into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact IR prior representation (IPR) to guide DIRformer. In the second stage, we train the DM to directly estimate the same IRP as pretrained CPEN$_{S1}$ only using LQ images. We observe that since the IPR is only a compact vector, DiffIR can use fewer iterations than traditional DM to obtain accurate estimations and generate more stable and realistic results. Since the iterations are few, our DiffIR can adopt a joint optimization of CPEN$_{S2}$, DIRformer, and denoising network, which can further reduce the estimation error influence. We conduct extensive experiments on several IR tasks and achieve SOTA performance while consuming less computational costs. 

**Title:** A Novel Autoencoders-LSTM Model for Stroke Outcome Prediction using  Multimodal MRI Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09484

**Abstract:** Patient outcome prediction is critical in management of ischemic stroke. In this paper, a novel machine learning model is proposed for stroke outcome prediction using multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The proposed model consists of two serial levels of Autoencoders (AEs), where different AEs at level 1 are used for learning unimodal features from different MRI modalities and a AE at level 2 is used to combine the unimodal features into compressed multimodal features. The sequences of multimodal features of a given patient are then used by an LSTM network for predicting outcome score. The proposed AE2-LSTM model is proved to be an effective approach for better addressing the multimodality and volumetric nature of MRI data. Experimental results show that the proposed AE2-LSTM outperforms the existing state-of-the art models by achieving highest AUC=0.71 and lowest MAE=0.34. 

**Title:** MATIS: Masked-Attention Transformers for Surgical Instrument  Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09514

**Abstract:** We propose Masked-Attention Transformers for Surgical Instrument Segmentation (MATIS), a two-stage, fully transformer-based method that leverages modern pixel-wise attention mechanisms for instrument segmentation. MATIS exploits the instance-level nature of the task by employing a masked attention module that generates and classifies a set of fine instrument region proposals. Our method incorporates long-term video-level information through video transformers to improve temporal consistency and enhance mask classification. We validate our approach in the two standard public benchmarks, Endovis 2017 and Endovis 2018. Our experiments demonstrate that MATIS' per-frame baseline outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and that including our temporal consistency module boosts our model's performance further. 

**Title:** $P+$: Extended Textual Conditioning in Text-to-Image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09522

**Abstract:** We introduce an Extended Textual Conditioning space in text-to-image models, referred to as $P+$. This space consists of multiple textual conditions, derived from per-layer prompts, each corresponding to a layer of the denoising U-net of the diffusion model. 

**Title:** InCrowdFormer: On-Ground Pedestrian World Model From Egocentric Views  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09534

**Abstract:** We introduce an on-ground Pedestrian World Model, a computational model that can predict how pedestrians move around an observer in the crowd on the ground plane, but from just the egocentric-views of the observer. Our model, InCrowdFormer, fully leverages the Transformer architecture by modeling pedestrian interaction and egocentric to top-down view transformation with attention, and autoregressively predicts on-ground positions of a variable number of people with an encoder-decoder architecture. We encode the uncertainties arising from unknown pedestrian heights with latent codes to predict the posterior distributions of pedestrian positions. We validate the effectiveness of InCrowdFormer on a novel prediction benchmark of real movements. The results show that InCrowdFormer accurately predicts the future coordination of pedestrians. To the best of our knowledge, InCrowdFormer is the first-of-its-kind pedestrian world model which we believe will benefit a wide range of egocentric-view applications including crowd navigation, tracking, and synthesis. 

**Title:** FateZero: Fusing Attentions for Zero-shot Text-based Video Editing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09535

**Abstract:** The diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in text-based image generation. However, since it contains enormous randomness in generation progress, it is still challenging to apply such models for real-world visual content editing, especially in videos. In this paper, we propose FateZero, a zero-shot text-based editing method on real-world videos without per-prompt training or use-specific mask. To edit videos consistently, we propose several techniques based on the pre-trained models. Firstly, in contrast to the straightforward DDIM inversion technique, our approach captures intermediate attention maps during inversion, which effectively retain both structural and motion information. These maps are directly fused in the editing process rather than generated during denoising. To further minimize semantic leakage of the source video, we then fuse self-attentions with a blending mask obtained by cross-attention features from the source prompt. Furthermore, we have implemented a reform of the self-attention mechanism in denoising UNet by introducing spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency. Yet succinct, our method is the first one to show the ability of zero-shot text-driven video style and local attribute editing from the trained text-to-image model. We also have a better zero-shot shape-aware editing ability based on the text-to-video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior temporal consistency and editing capability than previous works. 

**Title:** Diffusion-HPC: Generating Synthetic Images with Realistic Humans  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09541

**Abstract:** Recent text-to-image generative models have exhibited remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity and photo-realistic images. However, despite the visually impressive results, these models often struggle to preserve plausible human structure in the generations. Due to this reason, while generative models have shown promising results in aiding downstream image recognition tasks by generating large volumes of synthetic data, they remain infeasible for improving downstream human pose perception and understanding. In this work, we propose Diffusion model with Human Pose Correction (Diffusion HPC), a text-conditioned method that generates photo-realistic images with plausible posed humans by injecting prior knowledge about human body structure. We show that Diffusion HPC effectively improves the realism of human generations. Furthermore, as the generations are accompanied by 3D meshes that serve as ground truths, Diffusion HPC's generated image-mesh pairs are well-suited for downstream human mesh recovery task, where a shortage of 3D training data has long been an issue. 

**Title:** LERF: Language Embedded Radiance Fields  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09553

**Abstract:** Humans describe the physical world using natural language to refer to specific 3D locations based on a vast range of properties: visual appearance, semantics, abstract associations, or actionable affordances. In this work we propose Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERFs), a method for grounding language embeddings from off-the-shelf models like CLIP into NeRF, which enable these types of open-ended language queries in 3D. LERF learns a dense, multi-scale language field inside NeRF by volume rendering CLIP embeddings along training rays, supervising these embeddings across training views to provide multi-view consistency and smooth the underlying language field. After optimization, LERF can extract 3D relevancy maps for a broad range of language prompts interactively in real-time, which has potential use cases in robotics, understanding vision-language models, and interacting with 3D scenes. LERF enables pixel-aligned, zero-shot queries on the distilled 3D CLIP embeddings without relying on region proposals or masks, supporting long-tail open-vocabulary queries hierarchically across the volume.

**Title:** PartNeRF: Generating Part-Aware Editable 3D Shapes without 3D  Supervision  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09554

**Abstract:** Impressive progress in generative models and implicit representations gave rise to methods that can generate 3D shapes of high quality. However, being able to locally control and edit shapes is another essential property that can unlock several content creation applications. Local control can be achieved with part-aware models, but existing methods require 3D supervision and cannot produce textures. In this work, we devise PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis that does not require any explicit 3D supervision. Our model generates objects as a set of locally defined NeRFs, augmented with an affine transformation. This enables several editing operations such as applying transformations on parts, mixing parts from different objects etc. To ensure distinct, manipulable parts we enforce a hard assignment of rays to parts that makes sure that the color of each ray is only determined by a single NeRF. As a result, altering one part does not affect the appearance of the others. Evaluations on various ShapeNet categories demonstrate the ability of our model to generate editable 3D objects of improved fidelity, compared to previous part-based generative approaches that require 3D supervision or models relying on NeRFs. 

**Title:** Efficient Diffusion Training via Min-SNR Weighting Strategy  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09556

**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion models have been a mainstream approach for image generation, however, training these models often suffers from slow convergence. In this paper, we discovered that the slow convergence is partly due to conflicting optimization directions between timesteps. To address this issue, we treat the diffusion training as a multi-task learning problem, and introduce a simple yet effective approach referred to as Min-SNR-$\gamma$. This method adapts loss weights of timesteps based on clamped signal-to-noise ratios, which effectively balances the conflicts among timesteps. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in converging speed, 3.4$\times$ faster than previous weighting strategies. It is also more effective, achieving a new record FID score of 2.06 on the ImageNet $256\times256$ benchmark using smaller architectures than that employed in previous state-of-the-art. 

**Title:** The Tiny Time-series Transformer: Low-latency High-throughput  Classification of Astronomical Transients using Deep Model Compression  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08951

**Abstract:** A new golden age in astronomy is upon us, dominated by data. Large astronomical surveys are broadcasting unprecedented rates of information, demanding machine learning as a critical component in modern scientific pipelines to handle the deluge of data. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will raise the big-data bar for time-domain astronomy, with an expected 10 million alerts per-night, and generating many petabytes of data over the lifetime of the survey. Fast and efficient classification algorithms that can operate in real-time, yet robustly and accurately, are needed for time-critical events where additional resources can be sought for follow-up analyses. In order to handle such data, state-of-the-art deep learning architectures coupled with tools that leverage modern hardware accelerators are essential. We showcase how the use of modern deep compression methods can achieve a $18\times$ reduction in model size, whilst preserving classification performance. We also show that in addition to the deep compression techniques, careful choice of file formats can improve inference latency, and thereby throughput of alerts, on the order of $8\times$ for local processing, and $5\times$ in a live production setting. To test this in a live setting, we deploy this optimised version of the original time-series transformer, t2, into the community alert broking system of FINK on real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert data, and compare throughput performance with other science modules that exist in FINK. The results shown herein emphasise the time-series transformer's suitability for real-time classification at LSST scale, and beyond, and introduce deep model compression as a fundamental tool for improving deploy-ability and scalable inference of deep learning models for transient classification. 

**Title:** SwinVFTR: A Novel Volumetric Feature-learning Transformer for 3D OCT  Fluid Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09233

**Abstract:** Accurately segmenting fluid in 3D volumetric optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is a crucial yet challenging task for detecting eye diseases. Traditional autoencoding-based segmentation approaches have limitations in extracting fluid regions due to successive resolution loss in the encoding phase and the inability to recover lost information in the decoding phase. Although current transformer-based models for medical image segmentation addresses this limitation, they are not designed to be applied out-of-the-box for 3D OCT volumes, which have a wide-ranging channel-axis size based on different vendor device and extraction technique. To address these issues, we propose SwinVFTR, a new transformer-based architecture designed for precise fluid segmentation in 3D volumetric OCT images. We first utilize a channel-wise volumetric sampling for training on OCT volumes with varying depths (B-scans). Next, the model uses a novel shifted window transformer block in the encoder to achieve better localization and segmentation of fluid regions. Additionally, we propose a new volumetric attention block for spatial and depth-wise attention, which improves upon traditional residual skip connections. Consequently, utilizing multi-class dice loss, the proposed architecture outperforms other existing architectures on the three publicly available vendor-specific OCT datasets, namely Spectralis, Cirrus, and Topcon, with mean dice scores of 0.72, 0.59, and 0.68, respectively. Additionally, SwinVFTR outperforms other architectures in two additional relevant metrics, mean intersection-over-union (Mean-IOU) and structural similarity measure (SSIM). 

**Title:** Speech Modeling with a Hierarchical Transformer Dynamical VAE  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09404

**Abstract:** The dynamical variational autoencoders (DVAEs) are a family of latent-variable deep generative models that extends the VAE to model a sequence of observed data and a corresponding sequence of latent vectors. In almost all the DVAEs of the literature, the temporal dependencies within each sequence and across the two sequences are modeled with recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we propose to model speech signals with the Hierarchical Transformer DVAE (HiT-DVAE), which is a DVAE with two levels of latent variable (sequence-wise and frame-wise) and in which the temporal dependencies are implemented with the Transformer architecture. We show that HiT-DVAE outperforms several other DVAEs for speech spectrogram modeling, while enabling a simpler training procedure, revealing its high potential for downstream low-level speech processing tasks such as speech enhancement. 

**Title:** LDMVFI: Video Frame Interpolation with Latent Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09508

**Abstract:** Existing works on video frame interpolation (VFI) mostly employ deep neural networks trained to minimize the L1 or L2 distance between their outputs and ground-truth frames. Despite recent advances, existing VFI methods tend to produce perceptually inferior results, particularly for challenging scenarios including large motions and dynamic textures. Towards developing perceptually-oriented VFI methods, we propose latent diffusion model-based VFI, LDMVFI. This approaches the VFI problem from a generative perspective by formulating it as a conditional generation problem. As the first effort to address VFI using latent diffusion models, we rigorously benchmark our method following the common evaluation protocol adopted in the existing VFI literature. Our quantitative experiments and user study indicate that LDMVFI is able to interpolate video content with superior perceptual quality compared to the state of the art, even in the high-resolution regime. Our source code will be made available here.
