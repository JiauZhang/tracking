**Title:** Time Series as Images: Vision Transformer for Irregularly Sampled Time  Series  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12799

**Abstract:** Irregularly sampled time series are becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, especially in medical applications. Although different highly-customized methods have been proposed to tackle irregularity, how to effectively model their complicated dynamics and high sparsity is still an open problem. This paper studies the problem from a whole new perspective: transforming irregularly sampled time series into line graph images and adapting powerful vision transformers to perform time series classification in the same way as image classification. Our approach largely simplifies algorithm designs without assuming prior knowledge and can be potentially extended as a general-purpose framework. Despite its simplicity, we show that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art specialized algorithms on several popular healthcare and human activity datasets. Especially in the challenging leave-sensors-out setting where a subset of variables is masked during testing, the performance improvement is up to 54.0\% in absolute F1 score points.

**Title:** Features matching using natural language processing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12804

**Abstract:** The feature matching is a basic step in matching different datasets. This article proposes shows a new hybrid model of a pretrained Natural Language Processing (NLP) based model called BERT used in parallel with a statistical model based on Jaccard similarity to measure the similarity between list of features from two different datasets. This reduces the time required to search for correlations or manually match each feature from one dataset to another. 

**Title:** Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis using Discrete Gesture Token Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12822

**Abstract:** Synthesizing realistic co-speech gestures is an important and yet unsolved problem for creating believable motions that can drive a humanoid robot to interact and communicate with human users. Such capability will improve the impressions of the robots by human users and will find applications in education, training, and medical services. One challenge in learning the co-speech gesture model is that there may be multiple viable gesture motions for the same speech utterance. The deterministic regression methods can not resolve the conflicting samples and may produce over-smoothed or damped motions. We proposed a two-stage model to address this uncertainty issue in gesture synthesis by modeling the gesture segments as discrete latent codes. Our method utilizes RQ-VAE in the first stage to learn a discrete codebook consisting of gesture tokens from training data. In the second stage, a two-level autoregressive transformer model is used to learn the prior distribution of residual codes conditioned on input speech context. Since the inference is formulated as token sampling, multiple gesture sequences could be generated given the same speech input using top-k sampling. The quantitative results and the user study showed the proposed method outperforms the previous methods and is able to generate realistic and diverse gesture motions. 

**Title:** Test-time Defense against Adversarial Attacks: Detection and  Reconstruction of Adversarial Examples via Masked Autoencoder  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12848

**Abstract:** Existing defense methods against adversarial attacks can be categorized into training time and test time defenses. Training time defense, i.e., adversarial training, requires a significant amount of extra time for training and is often not able to be generalized to unseen attacks. On the other hand, test time defense by test time weight adaptation requires access to perform gradient descent on (part of) the model weights, which could be infeasible for models with frozen weights. To address these challenges, we propose DRAM, a novel defense method to Detect and Reconstruct multiple types of Adversarial attacks via Masked autoencoder (MAE). We demonstrate how to use MAE losses to build a KS-test to detect adversarial attacks. Moreover, the MAE losses can be used to repair adversarial samples from unseen attack types. In this sense, DRAM neither requires model weight updates in test time nor augments the training set with more adversarial samples. Evaluating DRAM on the large-scale ImageNet data, we achieve the best detection rate of 82% on average on eight types of adversarial attacks compared with other detection baselines. For reconstruction, DRAM improves the robust accuracy by 6% ~ 41% for Standard ResNet50 and 3% ~ 8% for Robust ResNet50 compared with other self-supervision tasks, such as rotation prediction and contrastive learning. 

**Title:** LP-IOANet: Efficient High Resolution Document Shadow Removal  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12862

**Abstract:** Document shadow removal is an integral task in document enhancement pipelines, as it improves visibility, readability and thus the overall quality. Assuming that the majority of practical document shadow removal scenarios require real-time, accurate models that can produce high-resolution outputs in-the-wild, we propose Laplacian Pyramid with Input/Output Attention Network (LP-IOANet), a novel pipeline with a lightweight architecture and an upsampling module. Furthermore, we propose three new datasets which cover a wide range of lighting conditions, images, shadow shapes and viewpoints. Our results show that we outperform the state-of-the-art by a 35% relative improvement in mean average error (MAE), while running real-time in four times the resolution (of the state-of-the-art method) on a mobile device. 

**Title:** NeRF-GAN Distillation for Efficient 3D-Aware Generation with  Convolutions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12865

**Abstract:** Pose-conditioned convolutional generative models struggle with high-quality 3D-consistent image generation from single-view datasets, due to their lack of sufficient 3D priors. Recently, the integration of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has transformed 3D-aware generation from single-view images. NeRF-GANs exploit the strong inductive bias of 3D neural representations and volumetric rendering at the cost of higher computational complexity. This study aims at revisiting pose-conditioned 2D GANs for efficient 3D-aware generation at inference time by distilling 3D knowledge from pretrained NeRF-GANS. We propose a simple and effective method, based on re-using the well-disentangled latent space of a pre-trained NeRF-GAN in a pose-conditioned convolutional network to directly generate 3D-consistent images corresponding to the underlying 3D representations. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains results comparable with volumetric rendering in terms of quality and 3D consistency while benefiting from the superior computational advantage of convolutional networks. The code will be available at: https://github.com/mshahbazi72/NeRF-GAN-Distillation 

**Title:** JaCoText: A Pretrained Model for Java Code-Text Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12869

**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based models have shown high performance in natural language generation task. However, a new wave of interest has surged: automatic programming language generation. This task consists of translating natural language instructions to a programming code. Despite the fact that well-known pretrained models on language generation have achieved good performance in learning programming languages, effort is still needed in automatic code generation. In this paper, we introduce JaCoText, a model based on Transformers neural network. It aims to generate java source code from natural language text. JaCoText leverages advantages of both natural language and code generation models. More specifically, we study some findings from the state of the art and use them to (1) initialize our model from powerful pretrained models, (2) explore additional pretraining on our java dataset, (3) carry out experiments combining the unimodal and bimodal data in the training, and (4) scale the input and output length during the fine-tuning of the model. Conducted experiments on CONCODE dataset show that JaCoText achieves new state-of-the-art results. 

**Title:** A Small-Scale Switch Transformer and NLP-based Model for Clinical  Narratives Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12892

**Abstract:** In recent years, Transformer-based models such as the Switch Transformer have achieved remarkable results in natural language processing tasks. However, these models are often too complex and require extensive pre-training, which limits their effectiveness for small clinical text classification tasks with limited data. In this study, we propose a simplified Switch Transformer framework and train it from scratch on a small French clinical text classification dataset at CHU Sainte-Justine hospital. Our results demonstrate that the simplified small-scale Transformer models outperform pre-trained BERT-based models, including DistillBERT, CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and FrALBERT. Additionally, using a mixture of expert mechanisms from the Switch Transformer helps capture diverse patterns; hence, the proposed approach achieves better results than a conventional Transformer with the self-attention mechanism. Finally, our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 87\%, precision at 87\%, and recall at 85\%, compared to the third-best pre-trained BERT-based model, FlauBERT, which achieved an accuracy of 84\%, precision at 84\%, and recall at 84\%. However, Switch Transformers have limitations, including a generalization gap and sharp minima. We compare it with a multi-layer perceptron neural network for small French clinical narratives classification and show that the latter outperforms all other models. 

**Title:** Cross-Layer Design for AI Acceleration with Non-Coherent Optical  Computing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12910

**Abstract:** Emerging AI applications such as ChatGPT, graph convolutional networks, and other deep neural networks require massive computational resources for training and inference. Contemporary computing platforms such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs are struggling to keep up with the demands of these AI applications. Non-coherent optical computing represents a promising approach for light-speed acceleration of AI workloads. In this paper, we show how cross-layer design can overcome challenges in non-coherent optical computing platforms. We describe approaches for optical device engineering, tuning circuit enhancements, and architectural innovations to adapt optical computing to a variety of AI workloads. We also discuss techniques for hardware/software co-design that can intelligently map and adapt AI software to improve its performance on non-coherent optical computing platforms. 

**Title:** TRON: Transformer Neural Network Acceleration with Non-Coherent Silicon  Photonics  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12914

**Abstract:** Transformer neural networks are rapidly being integrated into state-of-the-art solutions for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. However, the complex structure of these models creates challenges for accelerating their execution on conventional electronic platforms. We propose the first silicon photonic hardware neural network accelerator called TRON for transformer-based models such as BERT, and Vision Transformers. Our analysis demonstrates that TRON exhibits at least 14x better throughput and 8x better energy efficiency, in comparison to state-of-the-art transformer accelerators. 

**Title:** TSI-GAN: Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection using Convolutional  Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12952

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection is widely used in network intrusion detection, autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, credit card frauds, etc. However, several key challenges remain open, such as lack of ground truth labels, presence of complex temporal patterns, and generalizing over different datasets. This paper proposes TSI-GAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection model for time-series that can learn complex temporal patterns automatically and generalize well, i.e., no need for choosing dataset-specific parameters, making statistical assumptions about underlying data, or changing model architectures. To achieve these goals, we convert each input time-series into a sequence of 2D images using two encoding techniques with the intent of capturing temporal patterns and various types of deviance. Moreover, we design a reconstructive GAN that uses convolutional layers in an encoder-decoder network and employs cycle-consistency loss during training to ensure that inverse mappings are accurate as well. In addition, we also instrument a Hodrick-Prescott filter in post-processing to mitigate false positives. We evaluate TSI-GAN using 250 well-curated and harder-than-usual datasets and compare with 8 state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of TSI-GAN to all the baselines, offering an overall performance improvement of 13% and 31% over the second-best performer MERLIN and the third-best performer LSTM-AE, respectively. 

**Title:** Variantional autoencoder with decremental information bottleneck for  disentanglement  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12959

**Abstract:** One major challenge of disentanglement learning with variational autoencoders is the trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction fidelity. Previous incremental methods with only on latent space cannot optimize these two targets simultaneously, so they expand the Information Bottleneck while training to {optimize from disentanglement to reconstruction. However, a large bottleneck will lose the constraint of disentanglement, causing the information diffusion problem. To tackle this issue, we present a novel decremental variational autoencoder with disentanglement-invariant transformations to optimize multiple objectives in different layers, termed DeVAE, for balancing disentanglement and reconstruction fidelity by decreasing the information bottleneck of diverse latent spaces gradually. Benefiting from the multiple latent spaces, DeVAE allows simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives to optimize reconstruction while keeping the constraint of disentanglement, avoiding information diffusion. DeVAE is also compatible with large models with high-dimension latent space. Experimental results on dSprites and Shapes3D that DeVAE achieves \fix{R2q6}{a good balance between disentanglement and reconstruction.DeVAE shows high tolerant of hyperparameters and on high-dimensional latent spaces. 

**Title:** The Shaky Foundations of Clinical Foundation Models: A Survey of Large  Language Models and Foundation Models for EMRs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12961

**Abstract:** The successes of foundation models such as ChatGPT and AlphaFold have spurred significant interest in building similar models for electronic medical records (EMRs) to improve patient care and hospital operations. However, recent hype has obscured critical gaps in our understanding of these models' capabilities. We review over 80 foundation models trained on non-imaging EMR data (i.e. clinical text and/or structured data) and create a taxonomy delineating their architectures, training data, and potential use cases. We find that most models are trained on small, narrowly-scoped clinical datasets (e.g. MIMIC-III) or broad, public biomedical corpora (e.g. PubMed) and are evaluated on tasks that do not provide meaningful insights on their usefulness to health systems. In light of these findings, we propose an improved evaluation framework for measuring the benefits of clinical foundation models that is more closely grounded to metrics that matter in healthcare. 

**Title:** LMCodec: A Low Bitrate Speech Codec With Causal Transformer Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12984

**Abstract:** We introduce LMCodec, a causal neural speech codec that provides high quality audio at very low bitrates. The backbone of the system is a causal convolutional codec that encodes audio into a hierarchy of coarse-to-fine tokens using residual vector quantization. LMCodec trains a Transformer language model to predict the fine tokens from the coarse ones in a generative fashion, allowing for the transmission of fewer codes. A second Transformer predicts the uncertainty of the next codes given the past transmitted codes, and is used to perform conditional entropy coding. A MUSHRA subjective test was conducted and shows that the quality is comparable to reference codecs at higher bitrates. Example audio is available at https://mjenrungrot.github.io/chrome-media-audio-papers/publications/lmcodec. 

**Title:** FER-former: Multi-modal Transformer for Facial Expression Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12997

**Abstract:** The ever-increasing demands for intuitive interactions in Virtual Reality has triggered a boom in the realm of Facial Expression Recognition (FER). To address the limitations in existing approaches (e.g., narrow receptive fields and homogenous supervisory signals) and further cement the capacity of FER tools, a novel multifarious supervision-steering Transformer for FER in the wild is proposed in this paper. Referred as FER-former, our approach features multi-granularity embedding integration, hybrid self-attention scheme, and heterogeneous domain-steering supervision. In specific, to dig deep into the merits of the combination of features provided by prevailing CNNs and Transformers, a hybrid stem is designed to cascade two types of learning paradigms simultaneously. Wherein, a FER-specific transformer mechanism is devised to characterize conventional hard one-hot label-focusing and CLIP-based text-oriented tokens in parallel for final classification. To ease the issue of annotation ambiguity, a heterogeneous domains-steering supervision module is proposed to make image features also have text-space semantic correlations by supervising the similarity between image features and text features. On top of the collaboration of multifarious token heads, diverse global receptive fields with multi-modal semantic cues are captured, thereby delivering superb learning capability. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FER-former over the existing state-of-the-arts. 

**Title:** Is ChatGPT A Good Keyphrase Generator? A Preliminary Study  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13001

**Abstract:** The emergence of ChatGPT has recently garnered significant attention from the computational linguistics community. To demonstrate its capabilities as a keyphrase generator, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for the keyphrase generation task. We evaluate its performance in various aspects, including keyphrase generation prompts, keyphrase generation diversity, multi-domain keyphrase generation, and long document understanding. Our evaluation is based on six benchmark datasets, and we adopt the prompt suggested by OpenAI while extending it to six candidate prompts. We find that ChatGPT performs exceptionally well on all six candidate prompts, with minor performance differences observed across the datasets. Based on our findings, we conclude that ChatGPT has great potential for keyphrase generation. Moreover, we discover that ChatGPT still faces challenges when it comes to generating absent keyphrases. Meanwhile, in the final section, we also present some limitations and future expansions of this report. 

**Title:** Controllable Inversion of Black-Box Face-Recognition Models via  Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13006

**Abstract:** Face recognition models embed a face image into a low-dimensional identity vector containing abstract encodings of identity-specific facial features that allow individuals to be distinguished from one another. We tackle the challenging task of inverting the latent space of pre-trained face recognition models without full model access (i.e. black-box setting). A variety of methods have been proposed in literature for this task, but they have serious shortcomings such as a lack of realistic outputs, long inference times, and strong requirements for the data set and accessibility of the face recognition model. Through an analysis of the black-box inversion problem, we show that the conditional diffusion model loss naturally emerges and that we can effectively sample from the inverse distribution even without an identity-specific loss. Our method, named identity denoising diffusion probabilistic model (ID3PM), leverages the stochastic nature of the denoising diffusion process to produce high-quality, identity-preserving face images with various backgrounds, lighting, poses, and expressions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of identity preservation and diversity both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our method is the first black-box face recognition model inversion method that offers intuitive control over the generation process and does not suffer from any of the common shortcomings from competing methods. 

**Title:** MELTR: Meta Loss Transformer for Learning to Fine-tune Video Foundation  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13009

**Abstract:** Foundation models have shown outstanding performance and generalization capabilities across domains. Since most studies on foundation models mainly focus on the pretraining phase, a naive strategy to minimize a single task-specific loss is adopted for fine-tuning. However, such fine-tuning methods do not fully leverage other losses that are potentially beneficial for the target task. Therefore, we propose MEta Loss TRansformer (MELTR), a plug-in module that automatically and non-linearly combines various loss functions to aid learning the target task via auxiliary learning. We formulate the auxiliary learning as a bi-level optimization problem and present an efficient optimization algorithm based on Approximate Implicit Differentiation (AID). For evaluation, we apply our framework to various video foundation models (UniVL, Violet and All-in-one), and show significant performance gain on all four downstream tasks: text-to-video retrieval, video question answering, video captioning, and multi-modal sentiment analysis. Our qualitative analyses demonstrate that MELTR adequately `transforms' individual loss functions and `melts' them into an effective unified loss. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/MELTR. 

**Title:** GesGPT: Speech Gesture Synthesis With Text Parsing from GPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13013

**Abstract:** Gesture synthesis has gained significant attention as a critical research area, focusing on producing contextually appropriate and natural gestures corresponding to speech or textual input. Although deep learning-based approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they often overlook the rich semantic information present in the text, leading to less expressive and meaningful gestures. We propose GesGPT, a novel approach to gesture generation that leverages the semantic analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT. By capitalizing on the strengths of LLMs for text analysis, we design prompts to extract gesture-related information from textual input. Our method entails developing prompt principles that transform gesture generation into an intention classification problem based on GPT, and utilizing a curated gesture library and integration module to produce semantically rich co-speech gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that GesGPT effectively generates contextually appropriate and expressive gestures, offering a new perspective on semantic co-speech gesture generation. 

**Title:** Semantic Ray: Learning a Generalizable Semantic Field with  Cross-Reprojection Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13014

**Abstract:** In this paper, we aim to learn a semantic radiance field from multiple scenes that is accurate, efficient and generalizable. While most existing NeRFs target at the tasks of neural scene rendering, image synthesis and multi-view reconstruction, there are a few attempts such as Semantic-NeRF that explore to learn high-level semantic understanding with the NeRF structure. However, Semantic-NeRF simultaneously learns color and semantic label from a single ray with multiple heads, where the single ray fails to provide rich semantic information. As a result, Semantic NeRF relies on positional encoding and needs to train one specific model for each scene. To address this, we propose Semantic Ray (S-Ray) to fully exploit semantic information along the ray direction from its multi-view reprojections. As directly performing dense attention over multi-view reprojected rays would suffer from heavy computational cost, we design a Cross-Reprojection Attention module with consecutive intra-view radial and cross-view sparse attentions, which decomposes contextual information along reprojected rays and cross multiple views and then collects dense connections by stacking the modules. Experiments show that our S-Ray is able to learn from multiple scenes, and it presents strong generalization ability to adapt to unseen scenes. 

**Title:** MonoATT: Online Monocular 3D Object Detection with Adaptive Token  Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13018

**Abstract:** Mobile monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) (e.g., on a vehicle, a drone, or a robot) is an important yet challenging task. Existing transformer-based offline Mono3D models adopt grid-based vision tokens, which is suboptimal when using coarse tokens due to the limited available computational power. In this paper, we propose an online Mono3D framework, called MonoATT, which leverages a novel vision transformer with heterogeneous tokens of varying shapes and sizes to facilitate mobile Mono3D. The core idea of MonoATT is to adaptively assign finer tokens to areas of more significance before utilizing a transformer to enhance Mono3D. To this end, we first use prior knowledge to design a scoring network for selecting the most important areas of the image, and then propose a token clustering and merging network with an attention mechanism to gradually merge tokens around the selected areas in multiple stages. Finally, a pixel-level feature map is reconstructed from heterogeneous tokens before employing a SOTA Mono3D detector as the underlying detection core. Experiment results on the real-world KITTI dataset demonstrate that MonoATT can effectively improve the Mono3D accuracy for both near and far objects and guarantee low latency. MonoATT yields the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin and is ranked number one on the KITTI 3D benchmark. 

**Title:** Learning a Practical SDR-to-HDRTV Up-conversion using New Dataset and  Degradation Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13031

**Abstract:** In media industry, the demand of SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion arises when users possess HDR-WCG (high dynamic range-wide color gamut) TVs while most off-the-shelf footage is still in SDR (standard dynamic range). The research community has started tackling this low-level vision task by learning-based approaches. When applied to real SDR, yet, current methods tend to produce dim and desaturated result, making nearly no improvement on viewing experience. Different from other network-oriented methods, we attribute such deficiency to training set (HDR-SDR pair). Consequently, we propose new HDRTV dataset (dubbed HDRTV4K) and new HDR-to-SDR degradation models. Then, it's used to train a luminance-segmented network (LSN) consisting of a global mapping trunk, and two Transformer branches on bright and dark luminance range. We also update assessment criteria by tailored metrics and subjective experiment. Finally, ablation studies are conducted to prove the effectiveness. Our work is available at: https://github.com/AndreGuo/HDRTVDM. 

**Title:** Top-Down Visual Attention from Analysis by Synthesis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13043

**Abstract:** Current attention algorithms (e.g., self-attention) are stimulus-driven and highlight all the salient objects in an image. However, intelligent agents like humans often guide their attention based on the high-level task at hand, focusing only on task-related objects. This ability of task-guided top-down attention provides task-adaptive representation and helps the model generalize to various tasks. In this paper, we consider top-down attention from a classic Analysis-by-Synthesis (AbS) perspective of vision. Prior work indicates a functional equivalence between visual attention and sparse reconstruction; we show that an AbS visual system that optimizes a similar sparse reconstruction objective modulated by a goal-directed top-down signal naturally simulates top-down attention. We further propose Analysis-by-Synthesis Vision Transformer (AbSViT), which is a top-down modulated ViT model that variationally approximates AbS, and achieves controllable top-down attention. For real-world applications, AbSViT consistently improves over baselines on Vision-Language tasks such as VQA and zero-shot retrieval where language guides the top-down attention. AbSViT can also serve as a general backbone, improving performance on classification, semantic segmentation, and model robustness. 

**Title:** Towards Better Dynamic Graph Learning: New Architecture and Unified  Library  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13047

**Abstract:** We propose DyGFormer, a new Transformer-based architecture for dynamic graph learning that solely learns from the sequences of nodes' historical first-hop interactions. DyGFormer incorporates two distinct designs: a neighbor co-occurrence encoding scheme that explores the correlations of the source node and destination node based on their sequences; a patching technique that divides each sequence into multiple patches and feeds them to Transformer, allowing the model to effectively and efficiently benefit from longer histories. We also introduce DyGLib, a unified library with standard training pipelines, extensible coding interfaces, and comprehensive evaluating protocols to promote reproducible, scalable, and credible dynamic graph learning research. By performing extensive experiments on thirteen datasets from various domains for transductive/inductive dynamic link prediction and dynamic node classification tasks, we observe that: DyGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of the datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of capturing nodes' correlations and long-term temporal dependencies; the results of baselines vary across different datasets and some findings are inconsistent with previous reports, which may be caused by their diverse pipelines and problematic implementations. We hope our work can provide new insights and facilitate the development of the dynamic graph learning field. All the resources including datasets, data loaders, algorithms, and executing scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/yule-BUAA/DyGLib. 

**Title:** Generative AI-aided Optimization for AI-Generated Content (AIGC)  Services in Edge Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13052

**Abstract:** As Metaverse emerges as the next-generation Internet paradigm, the ability to efficiently generate content is paramount. AI-Generated Content (AIGC) offers a promising solution to this challenge. However, the training and deployment of large AI models necessitate significant resources. To address this issue, we introduce an AIGC-as-a-Service (AaaS) architecture, which deploys AIGC models in wireless edge networks, ensuring ubiquitous access to AIGC services for Metaverse users. Nonetheless, a key aspect of providing personalized user experiences requires the careful selection of AIGC service providers (ASPs) capable of effectively executing user tasks. This selection process is complicated by environmental uncertainty and variability, a challenge not yet addressed well in existing literature. Therefore, we first propose a diffusion model-based AI-generated optimal decision (AGOD) algorithm, which can generate the optimal ASP selection decisions. We then apply AGOD to deep reinforcement learning (DRL), resulting in the Deep Diffusion Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm, which achieves efficient and effective ASP selection. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D2SAC outperforms seven leading DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed AGOD algorithm has the potential for extension to various optimization problems in wireless networks, positioning it a promising approach for the future research on AIGC-driven services in Metaverse. The implementation of our proposed method is available at: https://github.com/Lizonghang/AGOD. 

**Title:** DiffPattern: Layout Pattern Generation via Discrete Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13060

**Abstract:** Deep generative models dominate the existing literature in layout pattern generation. However, leaving the guarantee of legality to an inexplicable neural network could be problematic in several applications. In this paper, we propose \tool{DiffPattern} to generate reliable layout patterns. \tool{DiffPattern} introduces a novel diverse topology generation method via a discrete diffusion model with compute-efficiently lossless layout pattern representation. Then a white-box pattern assessment is utilized to generate legal patterns given desired design rules. Our experiments on several benchmark settings show that \tool{DiffPattern} significantly outperforms existing baselines and is capable of synthesizing reliable layout patterns. 

**Title:** Retrieval-Augmented Classification with Decoupled Representation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13065

**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown marvelous improvements across various NLP tasks. Most Chinese PLMs simply treat an input text as a sequence of characters, and completely ignore word information. Although Whole Word Masking can alleviate this, the semantics in words is still not well represented. In this paper, we revisit the segmentation granularity of Chinese PLMs. We propose a mixed-granularity Chinese BERT (MigBERT) by considering both characters and words. To achieve this, we design objective functions for learning both character and word-level representations. We conduct extensive experiments on various Chinese NLP tasks to evaluate existing PLMs as well as the proposed MigBERT. Experimental results show that MigBERT achieves new SOTA performance on all these tasks. Further analysis demonstrates that words are semantically richer than characters. More interestingly, we show that MigBERT also works with Japanese. Our code has been released here~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/xnliang98/MigBERT}} and you can download our model here~\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/xnliang/MigBERT-large/}}. 

**Title:** PanoHead: Geometry-Aware 3D Full-Head Synthesis in 360$^{\circ}$  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13071

**Abstract:** Synthesis and reconstruction of 3D human head has gained increasing interests in computer vision and computer graphics recently. Existing state-of-the-art 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs) for 3D human head synthesis are either limited to near-frontal views or hard to preserve 3D consistency in large view angles. We propose PanoHead, the first 3D-aware generative model that enables high-quality view-consistent image synthesis of full heads in $360^\circ$ with diverse appearance and detailed geometry using only in-the-wild unstructured images for training. At its core, we lift up the representation power of recent 3D GANs and bridge the data alignment gap when training from in-the-wild images with widely distributed views. Specifically, we propose a novel two-stage self-adaptive image alignment for robust 3D GAN training. We further introduce a tri-grid neural volume representation that effectively addresses front-face and back-head feature entanglement rooted in the widely-adopted tri-plane formulation. Our method instills prior knowledge of 2D image segmentation in adversarial learning of 3D neural scene structures, enabling compositable head synthesis in diverse backgrounds. Benefiting from these designs, our method significantly outperforms previous 3D GANs, generating high-quality 3D heads with accurate geometry and diverse appearances, even with long wavy and afro hairstyles, renderable from arbitrary poses. Furthermore, we show that our system can reconstruct full 3D heads from single input images for personalized realistic 3D avatars. 

**Title:** Beyond Universal Transformer: block reusing with adaptor in Transformer  for automatic speech recognit  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13072

**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have recently made significant achievements in the application of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is possible to deploy the E2E ASR system on smart devices with the help of Transformer-based models. While these models still have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of model parameters. To overcome the drawback of universal Transformer models for the application of ASR on edge devices, we propose a solution that can reuse the block in Transformer models for the occasion of the small footprint ASR system, which meets the objective of accommodating resource limitations without compromising recognition accuracy. Specifically, we design a novel block-reusing strategy for speech Transformer (BRST) to enhance the effectiveness of parameters and propose an adapter module (ADM) that can produce a compact and adaptable model with only a few additional trainable parameters accompanying each reusing block. We conducted an experiment with the proposed method on the public AISHELL-1 corpus, and the results show that the proposed approach achieves the character error rate (CER) of 9.3%/6.63% with only 7.6M/8.3M parameters without and with the ADM, respectively. In addition, we also make a deeper analysis to show the effect of ADM in the general block-reusing method. 

**Title:** CORA: Adapting CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Detection with Region Prompting  and Anchor Pre-Matching  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13076

**Abstract:** Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) is an object detection task aiming at detecting objects from novel categories beyond the base categories on which the detector is trained. Recent OVD methods rely on large-scale visual-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, for recognizing novel objects. We identify the two core obstacles that need to be tackled when incorporating these models into detector training: (1) the distribution mismatch that happens when applying a VL-model trained on whole images to region recognition tasks; (2) the difficulty of localizing objects of unseen classes. To overcome these obstacles, we propose CORA, a DETR-style framework that adapts CLIP for Open-vocabulary detection by Region prompting and Anchor pre-matching. Region prompting mitigates the whole-to-region distribution gap by prompting the region features of the CLIP-based region classifier. Anchor pre-matching helps learning generalizable object localization by a class-aware matching mechanism. We evaluate CORA on the COCO OVD benchmark, where we achieve 41.7 AP50 on novel classes, which outperforms the previous SOTA by 2.4 AP50 even without resorting to extra training data. When extra training data is available, we train CORA$^+$ on both ground-truth base-category annotations and additional pseudo bounding box labels computed by CORA. CORA$^+$ achieves 43.1 AP50 on the COCO OVD benchmark and 28.1 box APr on the LVIS OVD benchmark. 

**Title:** PointGame: Geometrically and Adaptively Masked Auto-Encoder on Point  Clouds  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13100

**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning is attracting large attention in point cloud understanding. However, exploring discriminative and transferable features still remains challenging due to their nature of irregularity and sparsity. We propose a geometrically and adaptively masked auto-encoder for self-supervised learning on point clouds, termed \textit{PointGame}. PointGame contains two core components: GATE and EAT. GATE stands for the geometrical and adaptive token embedding module; it not only absorbs the conventional wisdom of geometric descriptors that captures the surface shape effectively, but also exploits adaptive saliency to focus on the salient part of a point cloud. EAT stands for the external attention-based Transformer encoder with linear computational complexity, which increases the efficiency of the whole pipeline. Unlike cutting-edge unsupervised learning models, PointGame leverages geometric descriptors to perceive surface shapes and adaptively mines discriminative features from training data. PointGame showcases clear advantages over its competitors on various downstream tasks under both global and local fine-tuning strategies. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available. 

**Title:** MMFormer: Multimodal Transformer Using Multiscale Self-Attention for  Remote Sensing Image Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13101

**Abstract:** To benefit the complementary information between heterogeneous data, we introduce a new Multimodal Transformer (MMFormer) for Remote Sensing (RS) image classification using Hyperspectral Image (HSI) accompanied by another source of data such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Compared with traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) lacking inductive biases of convolutions, we first introduce convolutional layers to our MMFormer to tokenize patches from multimodal data of HSI and LiDAR. Then we propose a Multi-scale Multi-head Self-Attention (MSMHSA) module to address the problem of compatibility which often limits to fuse HSI with high spectral resolution and LiDAR with relatively low spatial resolution. The proposed MSMHSA module can incorporate HSI to LiDAR data in a coarse-to-fine manner enabling us to learn a fine-grained representation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks (e.g., Trento and MUUFL) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed MMFormer for RS image classification. 

**Title:** MagicFusion: Boosting Text-to-Image Generation Performance by Fusing  Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13126

**Abstract:** The advent of open-source AI communities has produced a cornucopia of powerful text-guided diffusion models that are trained on various datasets. While few explorations have been conducted on ensembling such models to combine their strengths. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Saliency-aware Noise Blending (SNB) that can empower the fused text-guided diffusion models to achieve more controllable generation. Specifically, we experimentally find that the responses of classifier-free guidance are highly related to the saliency of generated images. Thus we propose to trust different models in their areas of expertise by blending the predicted noises of two diffusion models in a saliency-aware manner. SNB is training-free and can be completed within a DDIM sampling process. Additionally, it can automatically align the semantics of two noise spaces without requiring additional annotations such as masks. Extensive experiments show the impressive effectiveness of SNB in various applications. Project page is available at https://magicfusion.github.io/. 

**Title:** Masked Image Training for Generalizable Deep Image Denoising  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13132

**Abstract:** When capturing and storing images, devices inevitably introduce noise. Reducing this noise is a critical task called image denoising. Deep learning has become the de facto method for image denoising, especially with the emergence of Transformer-based models that have achieved notable state-of-the-art results on various image tasks. However, deep learning-based methods often suffer from a lack of generalization ability. For example, deep models trained on Gaussian noise may perform poorly when tested on other noise distributions. To address this issue, we present a novel approach to enhance the generalization performance of denoising networks, known as masked training. Our method involves masking random pixels of the input image and reconstructing the missing information during training. We also mask out the features in the self-attention layers to avoid the impact of training-testing inconsistency. Our approach exhibits better generalization ability than other deep learning models and is directly applicable to real-world scenarios. Additionally, our interpretability analysis demonstrates the superiority of our method. 

**Title:** Online search is more likely to lead students to validate true news than  to refute false ones  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13138

**Abstract:** With the spread of high-speed Internet and portable smart devices, the way people access and consume information has drastically changed. However, this presents many challenges, including information overload, personal data leakage, and misinformation diffusion. Across the spectrum of risks that Internet users can face nowadays, this work focuses on understanding how young people perceive and deal with false information. Within an experimental campaign involving 261 students, we presented to the participants six different news items and invited them to browse the Internet to assess the veracity of the presented information. Our results suggest that online search is more likely to lead students to validate true news than to refute false ones. We found that students change their opinion related to a specific piece of information more often than their global idea about a broader topic. Also, our experiment reflected that the majority of participants rely on online sources to obtain information and access the news, and those getting information from books and Internet browsing are the most accurate in assessing the veracity of a news item. This work provides a principled understanding of how young people perceive and distinguish true and false pieces of information, identifying strengths and weaknesses amidst young subjects and contributing to build tailored digital information literacy strategies for youth. 

**Title:** It is all Connected: A New Graph Formulation for Spatio-Temporal  Forecasting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13177

**Abstract:** With an ever-increasing number of sensors in modern society, spatio-temporal time series forecasting has become a de facto tool to make informed decisions about the future. Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions. 

**Title:** VADER: Video Alignment Differencing and Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13193

**Abstract:** We propose VADER, a spatio-temporal matching, alignment, and change summarization method to help fight misinformation spread via manipulated videos. VADER matches and coarsely aligns partial video fragments to candidate videos using a robust visual descriptor and scalable search over adaptively chunked video content. A transformer-based alignment module then refines the temporal localization of the query fragment within the matched video. A space-time comparator module identifies regions of manipulation between aligned content, invariant to any changes due to any residual temporal misalignments or artifacts arising from non-editorial changes of the content. Robustly matching video to a trusted source enables conclusions to be drawn on video provenance, enabling informed trust decisions on content encountered. 

**Title:** Fairness-guided Few-shot Prompting for Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13217

**Abstract:** Large language models have demonstrated surprising ability to perform in-context learning, i.e., these models can be directly applied to solve numerous downstream tasks by conditioning on a prompt constructed by a few input-output examples. However, prior research has shown that in-context learning can suffer from high instability due to variations in training examples, example order, and prompt formats. Therefore, the construction of an appropriate prompt is essential for improving the performance of in-context learning. In this paper, we revisit this problem from the view of predictive bias. Specifically, we introduce a metric to evaluate the predictive bias of a fixed prompt against labels or a given attributes. Then we empirically show that prompts with higher bias always lead to unsatisfactory predictive quality. Based on this observation, we propose a novel search strategy based on the greedy search to identify the near-optimal prompt for improving the performance of in-context learning. We perform comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art mainstream models such as GPT-3 on various downstream tasks. Our results indicate that our method can enhance the model's in-context learning performance in an effective and interpretable manner. 

**Title:** Parameter-Efficient Sparse Retrievers and Rerankers using Adapters  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13220

**Abstract:** Parameter-Efficient transfer learning with Adapters have been studied in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an alternative to full fine-tuning. Adapters are memory-efficient and scale well with downstream tasks by training small bottle-neck layers added between transformer layers while keeping the large pretrained language model (PLMs) frozen. In spite of showing promising results in NLP, these methods are under-explored in Information Retrieval. While previous studies have only experimented with dense retriever or in a cross lingual retrieval scenario, in this paper we aim to complete the picture on the use of adapters in IR. First, we study adapters for SPLADE, a sparse retriever, for which adapters not only retain the efficiency and effectiveness otherwise achieved by finetuning, but are memory-efficient and orders of magnitude lighter to train. We observe that Adapters-SPLADE not only optimizes just 2\% of training parameters, but outperforms fully fine-tuned counterpart and existing parameter-efficient dense IR models on IR benchmark datasets. Secondly, we address domain adaptation of neural retrieval thanks to adapters on cross-domain BEIR datasets and TripClick. Finally, we also consider knowledge sharing between rerankers and first stage rankers. Overall, our study complete the examination of adapters for neural IR 

**Title:** Explore the Power of Synthetic Data on Few-shot Object Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13221

**Abstract:** Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to expand an object detector for novel categories given only a few instances for training. The few training samples restrict the performance of FSOD model. Recent text-to-image generation models have shown promising results in generating high-quality images. How applicable these synthetic images are for FSOD tasks remains under-explored. This work extensively studies how synthetic images generated from state-of-the-art text-to-image generators benefit FSOD tasks. We focus on two perspectives: (1) How to use synthetic data for FSOD? (2) How to find representative samples from the large-scale synthetic dataset? We design a copy-paste-based pipeline for using synthetic data. Specifically, saliency object detection is applied to the original generated image, and the minimum enclosing box is used for cropping the main object based on the saliency map. After that, the cropped object is randomly pasted on the image, which comes from the base dataset. We also study the influence of the input text of text-to-image generator and the number of synthetic images used. To construct a representative synthetic training dataset, we maximize the diversity of the selected images via a sample-based and cluster-based method. However, the severe problem of high false positives (FP) ratio of novel categories in FSOD can not be solved by using synthetic data. We propose integrating CLIP, a zero-shot recognition model, into the FSOD pipeline, which can filter 90% of FP by defining a threshold for the similarity score between the detected object and the text of the predicted category. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of our method, in which performance gain is up to 21.9% compared to the few-shot baseline. 

**Title:** Exploring Structured Semantic Prior for Multi Label Recognition with  Incomplete Labels  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13223

**Abstract:** Multi-label recognition (MLR) with incomplete labels is very challenging. Recent works strive to explore the image-to-label correspondence in the vision-language model, \ie, CLIP~\cite{radford2021clip}, to compensate for insufficient annotations. In spite of promising performance, they generally overlook the valuable prior about the label-to-label correspondence. In this paper, we advocate remedying the deficiency of label supervision for the MLR with incomplete labels by deriving a structured semantic prior about the label-to-label correspondence via a semantic prior prompter. We then present a novel Semantic Correspondence Prompt Network (SCPNet), which can thoroughly explore the structured semantic prior. A Prior-Enhanced Self-Supervised Learning method is further introduced to enhance the use of the prior. Comprehensive experiments and analyses on several widely used benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods on all datasets, well demonstrating the effectiveness and the superiority of our method. Our code will be available at https://github.com/jameslahm/SCPNet. 

**Title:** Transforming Radiance Field with Lipschitz Network for Photorealistic 3D  Scene Stylization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13232

**Abstract:** Recent advances in 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis have witnessed the rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit NeRF for the photorealistic 3D scene stylization task, which aims to generate visually consistent and photorealistic stylized scenes from novel views. Simply coupling NeRF with photorealistic style transfer (PST) will result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses. Through a thorough analysis, we demonstrate that this non-trivial task can be simplified in a new light: When transforming the appearance representation of a pre-trained NeRF with Lipschitz mapping, the consistency and photorealism across source views will be seamlessly encoded into the syntheses. That motivates us to build a concise and flexible learning framework namely LipRF, which upgrades arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the 3D scene. Technically, LipRF first pre-trains a radiance field to reconstruct the 3D scene, and then emulates the style on each view by 2D PST as the prior to learn a Lipschitz network to stylize the pre-trained appearance. In view of that Lipschitz condition highly impacts the expressivity of the neural network, we devise an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and stylization. A gradual gradient aggregation strategy is further introduced to optimize LipRF in a cost-efficient manner. We conduct extensive experiments to show the high quality and robust performance of LipRF on both photorealistic 3D stylization and object appearance editing. 

**Title:** TAPS3D: Text-Guided 3D Textured Shape Generation from Pseudo Supervision  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13273

**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate an open research task of generating controllable 3D textured shapes from the given textual descriptions. Previous works either require ground truth caption labeling or extensive optimization time. To resolve these issues, we present a novel framework, TAPS3D, to train a text-guided 3D shape generator with pseudo captions. Specifically, based on rendered 2D images, we retrieve relevant words from the CLIP vocabulary and construct pseudo captions using templates. Our constructed captions provide high-level semantic supervision for generated 3D shapes. Further, in order to produce fine-grained textures and increase geometry diversity, we propose to adopt low-level image regularization to enable fake-rendered images to align with the real ones. During the inference phase, our proposed model can generate 3D textured shapes from the given text without any additional optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze each of our proposed components and show the efficacy of our framework in generating high-fidelity 3D textured and text-relevant shapes. 

**Title:** SINE: Semantic-driven Image-based NeRF Editing with Prior-guided Editing  Field  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13277

**Abstract:** Despite the great success in 2D editing using user-friendly tools, such as Photoshop, semantic strokes, or even text prompts, similar capabilities in 3D areas are still limited, either relying on 3D modeling skills or allowing editing within only a few categories.In this paper, we present a novel semantic-driven NeRF editing approach, which enables users to edit a neural radiance field with a single image, and faithfully delivers edited novel views with high fidelity and multi-view consistency.To achieve this goal, we propose a prior-guided editing field to encode fine-grained geometric and texture editing in 3D space, and develop a series of techniques to aid the editing process, including cyclic constraints with a proxy mesh to facilitate geometric supervision, a color compositing mechanism to stabilize semantic-driven texture editing, and a feature-cluster-based regularization to preserve the irrelevant content unchanged.Extensive experiments and editing examples on both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that our method achieves photo-realistic 3D editing using only a single edited image, pushing the bound of semantic-driven editing in 3D real-world scenes.

**Title:** GETT-QA: Graph Embedding based T2T Transformer for Knowledge Graph  Question Answering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13284

**Abstract:** In this work, we present an end-to-end Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) system named GETT-QA. GETT-QA uses T5, a popular text-to-text pre-trained language model. The model takes a question in natural language as input and produces a simpler form of the intended SPARQL query. In the simpler form, the model does not directly produce entity and relation IDs. Instead, it produces corresponding entity and relation labels. The labels are grounded to KG entity and relation IDs in a subsequent step. To further improve the results, we instruct the model to produce a truncated version of the KG embedding for each entity. The truncated KG embedding enables a finer search for disambiguation purposes. We find that T5 is able to learn the truncated KG embeddings without any change of loss function, improving KGQA performance. As a result, we report strong results for LC-QuAD 2.0 and SimpleQuestions-Wikidata datasets on end-to-end KGQA over Wikidata. 

**Title:** Leveraging Foundation Models for Clinical Text Analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13314

**Abstract:** Infectious diseases are a significant public health concern globally, and extracting relevant information from scientific literature can facilitate the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. However, the large amount of clinical data available presents a challenge for information extraction. To address this challenge, this study proposes a natural language processing (NLP) framework that uses a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on task-specific data to extract key information related to infectious diseases from free-text clinical data. The proposed framework includes three components: a data layer for preparing datasets from clinical texts, a foundation model layer for entity extraction, and an assessment layer for performance analysis. The results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed method outperforms standard methods, and leveraging prior knowledge through the pre-trained transformer model makes it useful for investigating other infectious diseases in the future. 

**Title:** Decentralized Adversarial Training over Graphs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13326

**Abstract:** The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of diffusion learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed scheme for both convex and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks. 

**Title:** Audio Diffusion Model for Speech Synthesis: A Survey on Text To Speech  and Speech Enhancement in Generative AI  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13336

**Abstract:** Generative AI has demonstrated impressive performance in various fields, among which speech synthesis is an interesting direction. With the diffusion model as the most popular generative model, numerous works have attempted two active tasks: text to speech and speech enhancement. This work conducts a survey on audio diffusion model, which is complementary to existing surveys that either lack the recent progress of diffusion-based speech synthesis or highlight an overall picture of applying diffusion model in multiple fields. Specifically, this work first briefly introduces the background of audio and diffusion model. As for the text-to-speech task, we divide the methods into three categories based on the stage where diffusion model is adopted: acoustic model, vocoder and end-to-end framework. Moreover, we categorize various speech enhancement tasks by either certain signals are removed or added into the input speech. Comparisons of experimental results and discussions are also covered in this survey. 

**Title:** Increasing Textual Context Size Boosts Medical Image-Text Matching  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13340

**Abstract:** This short technical report demonstrates a simple technique that yields state of the art results in medical image-text matching tasks. We analyze the use of OpenAI's CLIP, a general image-text matching model, and observe that CLIP's limited textual input size has negative impact on downstream performance in the medical domain where encoding longer textual contexts is often required. We thus train and release ClipMD, which is trained with a simple sliding window technique to encode textual captions. ClipMD was tested on two medical image-text datasets and compared with other image-text matching models. The results show that ClipMD outperforms other models on both datasets by a large margin. We make our code and pretrained model publicly available. 

**Title:** POTTER: Pooling Attention Transformer for Efficient Human Mesh Recovery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13357

**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved SOTA performance on the human mesh recovery (HMR) from monocular images. However, the performance gain has come at the cost of substantial memory and computational overhead. A lightweight and efficient model to reconstruct accurate human mesh is needed for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a pure transformer architecture named POoling aTtention TransformER (POTTER) for the HMR task from single images. Observing that the conventional attention module is memory and computationally expensive, we propose an efficient pooling attention module, which significantly reduces the memory and computational cost without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, we design a new transformer architecture by integrating a High-Resolution (HR) stream for the HMR task. The high-resolution local and global features from the HR stream can be utilized for recovering more accurate human mesh. Our POTTER outperforms the SOTA method METRO by only requiring 7% of total parameters and 14% of the Multiply-Accumulate Operations on the Human3.6M (PA-MPJPE metric) and 3DPW (all three metrics) datasets.

**Title:** Towards the Scalable Evaluation of Cooperativeness in Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13360

**Abstract:** It is likely that AI systems driven by pre-trained language models (PLMs) will increasingly be used to assist humans in high-stakes interactions with other agents, such as negotiation or conflict resolution. Consistent with the goals of Cooperative AI \citep{dafoe_open_2020}, we wish to understand and shape the multi-agent behaviors of PLMs in a pro-social manner. An important first step is the evaluation of model behaviour across diverse cooperation problems. Since desired behaviour in an interaction depends upon precise game-theoretic structure, we focus on generating scenarios with particular structures with both crowdworkers and a language model. Our work proceeds as follows. First, we discuss key methodological issues in the generation of scenarios corresponding to particular game-theoretic structures. Second, we employ both crowdworkers and a language model to generate such scenarios. We find that the quality of generations tends to be mediocre in both cases. We additionally get both crowdworkers and a language model to judge whether given scenarios align with their intended game-theoretic structure, finding mixed results depending on the game. Third, we provide a dataset of scenario based on our data generated. We provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of UnifiedQA and GPT-3 on this dataset. We find that instruct-tuned models tend to act in a way that could be perceived as cooperative when scaled up, while other models seemed to have flat scaling trends. 

**Title:** ChatGPT and a New Academic Reality: AI-Written Research Papers and the  Ethics of the Large Language Models in Scholarly Publishing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13367

**Abstract:** This paper discusses OpenAIs ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer, which uses natural language processing to fulfill text-based user requests (i.e., a chatbot). The history and principles behind ChatGPT and similar models are discussed. This technology is then discussed in relation to its potential impact on academia and scholarly research and publishing. ChatGPT is seen as a potential model for the automated preparation of essays and other types of scholarly manuscripts. Potential ethical issues that could arise with the emergence of large language models like GPT-3, the underlying technology behind ChatGPT, and its usage by academics and researchers, are discussed and situated within the context of broader advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing for research and scholarly publishing. 

**Title:** Fine-tuning ClimateBert transformer with ClimaText for the disclosure  analysis of climate-related financial risks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13373

**Abstract:** In recent years there has been a growing demand from financial agents, especially from particular and institutional investors, for companies to report on climate-related financial risks. A vast amount of information, in text format, can be expected to be disclosed in the short term by firms in order to identify these types of risks in their financial and non financial reports, particularly in response to the growing regulation that is being passed on the matter. To this end, this paper applies state-of-the-art NLP techniques to achieve the detection of climate change in text corpora. We use transfer learning to fine-tune two transformer models, BERT and ClimateBert -a recently published DistillRoBERTa-based model that has been specifically tailored for climate text classification-. These two algorithms are based on the transformer architecture which enables learning the contextual relationships between words in a text. We carry out the fine-tuning process of both models on the novel Clima-Text database, consisting of data collected from Wikipedia, 10K Files Reports and web-based claims. Our text classification model obtained from the ClimateBert fine-tuning process on ClimaText, outperforms the models created with BERT and the current state-of-the-art transformer in this particular problem. Our study is the first one to implement on the ClimaText database the recently published ClimateBert algorithm. Based on our results, it can be said that ClimateBert fine-tuned on ClimaText is an outstanding tool within the NLP pre-trained transformer models that may and should be used by investors, institutional agents and companies themselves to monitor the disclosure of climate risk in financial reports. In addition, our transfer learning methodology is cheap in computational terms, thus allowing any organization to perform it. 

**Title:** Capabilities of GPT-4 on Medical Challenge Problems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13375

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety. 

**Title:** Practical and Ethical Challenges of Large Language Models in Education:  A Systematic Literature Review  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13379

**Abstract:** Educational technology innovations that have been developed based on large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (e.g., question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The practical and ethical challenges of LLMs-based innovations were also identified by assessing their technological readiness, model performance, replicability, system transparency, privacy, equality, and beneficence. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-3), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. These recommendations could support future research to develop practical and ethical innovations for supporting diverse educational tasks and benefiting students, teachers, and institutions. 

**Title:** Zero-guidance Segmentation Using Zero Segment Labels  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13396

**Abstract:** CLIP has enabled new and exciting joint vision-language applications, one of which is open-vocabulary segmentation, which can locate any segment given an arbitrary text query. In our research, we ask whether it is possible to discover semantic segments without any user guidance in the form of text queries or predefined classes, and label them using natural language automatically? We propose a novel problem zero-guidance segmentation and the first baseline that leverages two pre-trained generalist models, DINO and CLIP, to solve this problem without any fine-tuning or segmentation dataset. The general idea is to first segment an image into small over-segments, encode them into CLIP's visual-language space, translate them into text labels, and merge semantically similar segments together. The key challenge, however, is how to encode a visual segment into a segment-specific embedding that balances global and local context information, both useful for recognition. Our main contribution is a novel attention-masking technique that balances the two contexts by analyzing the attention layers inside CLIP. We also introduce several metrics for the evaluation of this new task. With CLIP's innate knowledge, our method can precisely locate the Mona Lisa painting among a museum crowd.

**Title:** DDT: A Diffusion-Driven Transformer-based Framework for Human Mesh  Recovery from a Video  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13397

**Abstract:** Human mesh recovery (HMR) provides rich human body information for various real-world applications such as gaming, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. Compared to single image-based methods, video-based methods can utilize temporal information to further improve performance by incorporating human body motion priors. However, many-to-many approaches such as VIBE suffer from motion smoothness and temporal inconsistency. While many-to-one approaches such as TCMR and MPS-Net rely on the future frames, which is non-causal and time inefficient during inference. To address these challenges, a novel Diffusion-Driven Transformer-based framework (DDT) for video-based HMR is presented. DDT is designed to decode specific motion patterns from the input sequence, enhancing motion smoothness and temporal consistency. As a many-to-many approach, the decoder of our DDT outputs the human mesh of all the frames, making DDT more viable for real-world applications where time efficiency is crucial and a causal model is desired. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW), which demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our DDT. 

**Title:** Paraphrasing evades detectors of AI-generated text, but retrieval is an  effective defense  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13408

**Abstract:** To detect the deployment of large language models for malicious use cases (e.g., fake content creation or academic plagiarism), several approaches have recently been proposed for identifying AI-generated text via watermarks or statistical irregularities. How robust are these detection algorithms to paraphrases of AI-generated text? To stress test these detectors, we first train an 11B parameter paraphrase generation model (DIPPER) that can paraphrase paragraphs, optionally leveraging surrounding text (e.g., user-written prompts) as context. DIPPER also uses scalar knobs to control the amount of lexical diversity and reordering in the paraphrases. Paraphrasing text generated by three large language models (including GPT3.5-davinci-003) with DIPPER successfully evades several detectors, including watermarking, GPTZero, DetectGPT, and OpenAI's text classifier. For example, DIPPER drops the detection accuracy of DetectGPT from 70.3% to 4.6% (at a constant false positive rate of 1%), without appreciably modifying the input semantics. To increase the robustness of AI-generated text detection to paraphrase attacks, we introduce a simple defense that relies on retrieving semantically-similar generations and must be maintained by a language model API provider. Given a candidate text, our algorithm searches a database of sequences previously generated by the API, looking for sequences that match the candidate text within a certain threshold. We empirically verify our defense using a database of 15M generations from a fine-tuned T5-XXL model and find that it can detect 80% to 97% of paraphrased generations across different settings, while only classifying 1% of human-written sequences as AI-generated. We will open source our code, model and data for future research. 

**Title:** Medical diffusion on a budget: textual inversion for medical image  generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13430

**Abstract:** Diffusion-based models for text-to-image generation have gained immense popularity due to recent advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and quality. Although it is becoming increasingly feasible to perform inference with these systems using consumer-grade GPUs, training them from scratch still requires access to large datasets and significant computational resources. In the case of medical image generation, the availability of large, publicly accessible datasets that include text reports is limited due to legal and ethical concerns. While training a diffusion model on a private dataset may address this issue, it is not always feasible for institutions lacking the necessary computational resources. This work demonstrates that pre-trained Stable Diffusion models, originally trained on natural images, can be adapted to various medical imaging modalities by training text embeddings with textual inversion. In this study, we conducted experiments using medical datasets comprising only 100 samples from three medical modalities. Embeddings were trained in a matter of hours, while still retaining diagnostic relevance in image generation. Experiments were designed to achieve several objectives. Firstly, we fine-tuned the training and inference processes of textual inversion, revealing that larger embeddings and more examples are required. Secondly, we validated our approach by demonstrating a 2\% increase in the diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, which is a challenging multi-modal imaging modality, from 0.78 to 0.80. Thirdly, we performed simulations by interpolating between healthy and diseased states, combining multiple pathologies, and inpainting to show embedding flexibility and control of disease appearance. Finally, the embeddings trained in this study are small (less than 1 MB), which facilitates easy sharing of medical data with reduced privacy concerns. 

**Title:** Patch-Mix Transformer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: A Game  Perspective  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13434

**Abstract:** Endeavors have been recently made to leverage the vision transformer (ViT) for the challenging unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task. They typically adopt the cross-attention in ViT for direct domain alignment. However, as the performance of cross-attention highly relies on the quality of pseudo labels for targeted samples, it becomes less effective when the domain gap becomes large. We solve this problem from a game theory's perspective with the proposed model dubbed as PMTrans, which bridges source and target domains with an intermediate domain. Specifically, we propose a novel ViT-based module called PatchMix that effectively builds up the intermediate domain, i.e., probability distribution, by learning to sample patches from both domains based on the game-theoretical models. This way, it learns to mix the patches from the source and target domains to maximize the cross entropy (CE), while exploiting two semi-supervised mixup losses in the feature and label spaces to minimize it. As such, we interpret the process of UDA as a min-max CE game with three players, including the feature extractor, classifier, and PatchMix, to find the Nash Equilibria. Moreover, we leverage attention maps from ViT to re-weight the label of each patch by its importance, making it possible to obtain more domain-discriminative feature representations. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results show that PMTrans significantly surpasses the ViT-based and CNN-based SoTA methods by +3.6% on Office-Home, +1.4% on Office-31, and +17.7% on DomainNet, respectively. 

**Title:** Text2Video-Zero: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Zero-Shot Video  Generators  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13439

**Abstract:** Recent text-to-video generation approaches rely on computationally heavy training and require large-scale video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new task of zero-shot text-to-video generation and propose a low-cost approach (without any training or optimization) by leveraging the power of existing text-to-image synthesis methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion), making them suitable for the video domain. 

**Title:** CLIP for All Things Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval, Fine-Grained  or Not  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13440

**Abstract:** In this paper, we leverage CLIP for zero-shot sketch based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR). We are largely inspired by recent advances on foundation models and the unparalleled generalisation ability they seem to offer, but for the first time tailor it to benefit the sketch community. We put forward novel designs on how best to achieve this synergy, for both the category setting and the fine-grained setting ("all"). At the very core of our solution is a prompt learning setup. First we show just via factoring in sketch-specific prompts, we already have a category-level ZS-SBIR system that overshoots all prior arts, by a large margin (24.8%) - a great testimony on studying the CLIP and ZS-SBIR synergy. Moving onto the fine-grained setup is however trickier, and requires a deeper dive into this synergy. For that, we come up with two specific designs to tackle the fine-grained matching nature of the problem: (i) an additional regularisation loss to ensure the relative separation between sketches and photos is uniform across categories, which is not the case for the gold standard standalone triplet loss, and (ii) a clever patch shuffling technique to help establishing instance-level structural correspondences between sketch-photo pairs. With these designs, we again observe significant performance gains in the region of 26.9% over previous state-of-the-art. The take-home message, if any, is the proposed CLIP and prompt learning paradigm carries great promise in tackling other sketch-related tasks (not limited to ZS-SBIR) where data scarcity remains a great challenge. Code and models will be made available. 

**Title:** Set-the-Scene: Global-Local Training for Generating Controllable NeRF  Scenes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13450

**Abstract:** Recent breakthroughs in text-guided image generation have led to remarkable progress in the field of 3D synthesis from text. By optimizing neural radiance fields (NeRF) directly from text, recent methods are able to produce remarkable results. Yet, these methods are limited in their control of each object's placement or appearance, as they represent the scene as a whole. This can be a major issue in scenarios that require refining or manipulating objects in the scene. To remedy this deficit, we propose a novel GlobalLocal training framework for synthesizing a 3D scene using object proxies. A proxy represents the object's placement in the generated scene and optionally defines its coarse geometry. The key to our approach is to represent each object as an independent NeRF. We alternate between optimizing each NeRF on its own and as part of the full scene. Thus, a complete representation of each object can be learned, while also creating a harmonious scene with style and lighting match. We show that using proxies allows a wide variety of editing options, such as adjusting the placement of each independent object, removing objects from a scene, or refining an object. Our results show that Set-the-Scene offers a powerful solution for scene synthesis and manipulation, filling a crucial gap in controllable text-to-3D synthesis. 

**Title:** CoBIT: A Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text Generation Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13455

**Abstract:** The field of vision and language has witnessed a proliferation of pre-trained foundation models. Most existing methods are independently pre-trained with contrastive objective like CLIP, image-to-text generative objective like PaLI, or text-to-image generative objective like Parti. However, the three objectives can be pre-trained on the same data, image-text pairs, and intuitively they complement each other as contrasting provides global alignment capacity and generation grants fine-grained understanding. In this work, we present a Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT), which attempts to unify the three pre-training objectives in one framework. Specifically, CoBIT employs a novel unicoder-decoder structure, consisting of an image unicoder, a text unicoder and a cross-modal decoder. The image/text unicoders can switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge that benefits both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. CoBIT achieves superior performance in image understanding, image-text understanding (Retrieval, Captioning, VQA, SNLI-VE) and text-based content creation, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. For instance, 82.7% in zero-shot ImageNet classification, 9.37 FID score in zero-shot text-to-image generation and 44.8 CIDEr in zero-shot captioning. 

**Title:** Plotting Behind the Scenes: Towards Learnable Game Engines  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13472

**Abstract:** Game engines are powerful tools in computer graphics. Their power comes at the immense cost of their development. In this work, we present a framework to train game-engine-like neural models, solely from monocular annotated videos. The result-a Learnable Game Engine (LGE)-maintains states of the scene, objects and agents in it, and enables rendering the environment from a controllable viewpoint. Similarly to a game engine, it models the logic of the game and the underlying rules of physics, to make it possible for a user to play the game by specifying both high- and low-level action sequences. Most captivatingly, our LGE unlocks the director's mode, where the game is played by plotting behind the scenes, specifying high-level actions and goals for the agents in the form of language and desired states. This requires learning "game AI", encapsulated by our animation model, to navigate the scene using high-level constraints, play against an adversary, devise the strategy to win a point. The key to learning such game AI is the exploitation of a large and diverse text corpus, collected in this work, describing detailed actions in a game and used to train our animation model. To render the resulting state of the environment and its agents, we use a compositional NeRF representation used in our synthesis model. To foster future research, we present newly collected, annotated and calibrated large-scale Tennis and Minecraft datasets. Our method significantly outperforms existing neural video game simulators in terms of rendering quality. Besides, our LGEs unlock applications beyond capabilities of the current state of the art. Our framework, data, and models are available at https://learnable-game-engines.github.io/lge-website. 

**Title:** TransPoser: Transformer as an Optimizer for Joint Object Shape and Pose  Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13477

**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for joint estimation of shape and pose of rigid objects from their sequentially observed RGB-D images. In sharp contrast to past approaches that rely on complex non-linear optimization, we propose to formulate it as a neural optimization that learns to efficiently estimate the shape and pose. We introduce Deep Directional Distance Function (DeepDDF), a neural network that directly outputs the depth image of an object given the camera viewpoint and viewing direction, for efficient error computation in 2D image space. We formulate the joint estimation itself as a Transformer which we refer to as TransPoser. We fully leverage the tokenization and multi-head attention to sequentially process the growing set of observations and to efficiently update the shape and pose with a learned momentum, respectively. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that DeepDDF achieves high accuracy as a category-level object shape representation and TransPoser achieves state-of-the-art accuracy efficiently for joint shape and pose estimation. 

**Title:** ReVersion: Diffusion-Based Relation Inversion from Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13495

**Abstract:** Diffusion models gain increasing popularity for their generative capabilities. Recently, there have been surging needs to generate customized images by inverting diffusion models from exemplar images. However, existing inversion methods mainly focus on capturing object appearances. How to invert object relations, another important pillar in the visual world, remains unexplored. In this work, we propose ReVersion for the Relation Inversion task, which aims to learn a specific relation (represented as "relation prompt") from exemplar images. Specifically, we learn a relation prompt from a frozen pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The learned relation prompt can then be applied to generate relation-specific images with new objects, backgrounds, and styles. Our key insight is the "preposition prior" - real-world relation prompts can be sparsely activated upon a set of basis prepositional words. Specifically, we propose a novel relation-steering contrastive learning scheme to impose two critical properties of the relation prompt: 1) The relation prompt should capture the interaction between objects, enforced by the preposition prior. 2) The relation prompt should be disentangled away from object appearances. We further devise relation-focal importance sampling to emphasize high-level interactions over low-level appearances (e.g., texture, color). To comprehensively evaluate this new task, we contribute ReVersion Benchmark, which provides various exemplar images with diverse relations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach over existing methods across a wide range of visual relations. 

**Title:** The effectiveness of MAE pre-pretraining for billion-scale pretraining  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13496

**Abstract:** This paper revisits the standard pretrain-then-finetune paradigm used in computer vision for visual recognition tasks. Typically, state-of-the-art foundation models are pretrained using large scale (weakly) supervised datasets with billions of images. We introduce an additional pre-pretraining stage that is simple and uses the self-supervised MAE technique to initialize the model. While MAE has only been shown to scale with the size of models, we find that it scales with the size of the training dataset as well. Thus, our MAE-based pre-pretraining scales with both model and data size making it applicable for training foundation models. Pre-pretraining consistently improves both the model convergence and the downstream transfer performance across a range of model scales (millions to billions of parameters), and dataset sizes (millions to billions of images). We measure the effectiveness of pre-pretraining on 10 different visual recognition tasks spanning image classification, video recognition, object detection, low-shot classification and zero-shot recognition. Our largest model achieves new state-of-the-art results on iNaturalist-18 (91.3%), 1-shot ImageNet-1k (62.1%), and zero-shot transfer on Food-101 (96.0%). Our study reveals that model initialization plays a significant role, even for web-scale pretraining with billions of images. 

**Title:** TriPlaneNet: An Encoder for EG3D Inversion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13497

**Abstract:** Recent progress in NeRF-based GANs has introduced a number of approaches for high-resolution and high-fidelity generative modeling of human heads with a possibility for novel view rendering. At the same time, one must solve an inverse problem to be able to re-render or modify an existing image or video. Despite the success of universal optimization-based methods for 2D GAN inversion, those, applied to 3D GANs, may fail to produce 3D-consistent renderings. Fast encoder-based techniques, such as those developed for StyleGAN, may also be less appealing due to the lack of identity preservation. In our work, we introduce a real-time method that bridges the gap between the two approaches by directly utilizing the tri-plane representation introduced for EG3D generative model. In particular, we build upon a feed-forward convolutional encoder for the latent code and extend it with a fully-convolutional predictor of tri-plane numerical offsets. As shown in our work, the renderings are similar in quality to optimization-based techniques and significantly outperform the baselines for novel view. As we empirically prove, this is a consequence of directly operating in the tri-plane space, not in the GAN parameter space, while making use of an encoder-based trainable approach. 

**Title:** Ablating Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13516

**Abstract:** Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models can generate high-fidelity images with powerful compositional ability. However, these models are typically trained on an enormous amount of Internet data, often containing copyrighted material, licensed images, and personal photos. Furthermore, they have been found to replicate the style of various living artists or memorize exact training samples. How can we remove such copyrighted concepts or images without retraining the model from scratch? To achieve this goal, we propose an efficient method of ablating concepts in the pretrained model, i.e., preventing the generation of a target concept. Our algorithm learns to match the image distribution for a target style, instance, or text prompt we wish to ablate to the distribution corresponding to an anchor concept. This prevents the model from generating target concepts given its text condition. Extensive experiments show that our method can successfully prevent the generation of the ablated concept while preserving closely related concepts in the model. 

**Title:** Artificial diffusion for convective and acoustic low Mach number flows  I: Analysis of the modified equations, and application to Roe-type schemes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08977

**Abstract:** Three asymptotic limits exist for the Euler equations at low Mach number - purely convective, purely acoustic, and mixed convective-acoustic. Standard collocated density-based numerical schemes for compressible flow are known to fail at low Mach number due to the incorrect asymptotic scaling of the artificial diffusion. Previous studies of this class of schemes have shown a variety of behaviours across the different limits and proposed guidelines for the design of low-Mach schemes. However, these studies have primarily focused on specific discretisations and/or only the convective limit. 

**Title:** Artificial diffusion for convective and acoustic low Mach number flows  II: Application to Liou-Steffen, Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez  convection-pressure flux splittings  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10740

**Abstract:** Liou-Steffen splitting (AUSM) schemes are popular for low Mach number simulations, however, like many numerical schemes for compressible flow they require careful modification to accurately resolve convective features in this regime. Previous analyses of these schemes usually focus only on a single discrete scheme at the convective limit, only considering flow with acoustic effects empirically, if at all. In our recent paper Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023 we derived constraints on the artificial diffusion scaling of low Mach number schemes for flows both with and without acoustic effects, and applied this analysis to Roe-type finite-volume schemes. In this paper we form approximate diffusion matrices for the Liou-Steffen splitting, as well as the closely related Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez splittings. We use the constraints found in Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023 to derive and analyse the required scaling of each splitting at low Mach number. By transforming the diffusion matrices to the entropy variables we can identify erroneous diffusion terms compared to the ideal form used in Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023. These terms vanish asymptotically for the Liou-Steffen splitting, but result in spurious entropy generation for the Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez splittings unless a particular form of the interface pressure is used. Numerical examples for acoustic and convective flow verify the results of the analysis, and show the importance of considering the resolution of the entropy field when assessing schemes of this type. 

**Title:** A Data Augmentation Method and the Embedding Mechanism for Detection and  Classification of Pulmonary Nodules on Small Samples  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12801

**Abstract:** Detection of pulmonary nodules by CT is used for screening lung cancer in early stages.omputer aided diagnosis (CAD) based on deep-learning method can identify the suspected areas of pulmonary nodules in CT images, thus improving the accuracy and efficiency of CT diagnosis. The accuracy and robustness of deep learning models. Method:In this paper, we explore (1) the data augmentation method based on the generation model and (2) the model structure improvement method based on the embedding mechanism. Two strategies have been introduced in this study: a new data augmentation method and a embedding mechanism. In the augmentation method, a 3D pixel-level statistics algorithm is proposed to generate pulmonary nodule and by combing the faked pulmonary nodule and healthy lung, we generate new pulmonary nodule samples. The embedding mechanism are designed to better understand the meaning of pixels of the pulmonary nodule samples by introducing hidden variables. Result: The result of the 3DVNET model with the augmentation method for pulmonary nodule detection shows that the proposed data augmentation method outperforms the method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, training accuracy improved by 1.5%, and with embedding mechanism for pulmonary nodules classification shows that the embedding mechanism improves the accuracy and robustness for the classification of pulmonary nodules obviously, the model training accuracy is close to 1 and the model testing F1-score is 0.90.Conclusion:he proposed data augmentation method and embedding mechanism are beneficial to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model, and can be further applied in other common diagnostic imaging tasks. 

**Title:** Cube-Based 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Cone Beam  Computed Tomography Reconstruction with Incomplete Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12861

**Abstract:** Deep learning (DL) has been extensively researched in the field of computed tomography (CT) reconstruction with incomplete data, particularly in sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, applying DL to sparse-view cone beam CT (CBCT) remains challenging. Many models learn the mapping from sparse-view CT images to ground truth but struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in terms of global artifact removal. Incorporating sinogram data and utilizing dual-domain information can enhance anti-artifact performance, but this requires storing the entire sinogram in memory. This presents a memory issue for high-resolution CBCT sinograms, limiting further research and application. In this paper, we propose a cube-based 3D denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for CBCT reconstruction using down-sampled data. A DDPM network, trained on cubes extracted from paired fully sampled sinograms and down-sampled sinograms, is employed to inpaint down-sampled sinograms. Our method divides the entire sinogram into overlapping cubes and processes these cubes in parallel using multiple GPUs, overcoming memory limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively suppresses few-view artifacts while preserving textural details faithfully. 

**Title:** A Permutable Hybrid Network for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13111

**Abstract:** The advent of Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought substantial advancements in 3D volumetric benchmarks, particularly in 3D medical image segmentation. Concurrently, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks have regained popularity among researchers due to their comparable results to ViT, albeit with the exclusion of the heavy self-attention module. This paper introduces a permutable hybrid network for volumetric medical image segmentation, named PHNet, which exploits the advantages of convolution neural network (CNN) and MLP. PHNet addresses the intrinsic isotropy problem of 3D volumetric data by utilizing both 2D and 3D CNN to extract local information. Besides, we propose an efficient Multi-Layer Permute Perceptron module, named MLPP, which enhances the original MLP by obtaining long-range dependence while retaining positional information. Extensive experimental results validate that PHNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, namely, COVID-19-20 and Synapse. Moreover, the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of PHNet in harnessing the strengths of both CNN and MLP. The code will be accessible to the public upon acceptance. 

**Title:** Numerical Bifurcation Analysis of Turing and Symmetry Broken Patterns of  a Vegetation PDE Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13248

**Abstract:** We study the mechanisms of pattern formation for vegetation dynamics in water-limited regions. Our analysis is based on a set of two partial differential equations (PDEs) of reaction-diffusion type for the biomass and water and one ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing the dependence of the toxicity on the biomass. We perform a linear stability analysis in the one-dimensional finite space, we derive analytically the conditions for the appearance of Turing instability that gives rise to spatio-temporal patterns emanating from the homogeneous solution, and provide its dependence with respect to the size of the domain. Furthermore, we perform a numerical bifurcation analysis in order to study the pattern formation of the inhomogeneous solution, with respect to the precipitation rate, thus analyzing the stability and symmetry properties of the emanating patterns. Based on the numerical bifurcation analysis, we have found new patterns, which form due to the onset of secondary bifurcations from the primary Turing instability, thus giving rise to a multistability of asymmetric solutions. 

**Title:** Clinically Relevant Latent Space Embedding of Cancer Histopathology  Slides through Variational Autoencoder Based Image Compression  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13332

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based training approach that can compress and decompress cancer pathology slides at a compression ratio of 1:512, which is better than the previously reported state of the art (SOTA) in the literature, while still maintaining accuracy in clinical validation tasks. The compression approach was tested on more common computer vision datasets such as CIFAR10, and we explore which image characteristics enable this compression ratio on cancer imaging data but not generic images. We generate and visualize embeddings from the compressed latent space and demonstrate how they are useful for clinical interpretation of data, and how in the future such latent embeddings can be used to accelerate search of clinical imaging data. 

**Title:** MSFA-Frequency-Aware Transformer for Hyperspectral Images Demosaicing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13404

**Abstract:** Hyperspectral imaging systems that use multispectral filter arrays (MSFA) capture only one spectral component in each pixel. Hyperspectral demosaicing is used to recover the non-measured components. While deep learning methods have shown promise in this area, they still suffer from several challenges, including limited modeling of non-local dependencies, lack of consideration of the periodic MSFA pattern that could be linked to periodic artifacts, and difficulty in recovering high-frequency details. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel de-mosaicing framework, the MSFA-frequency-aware Transformer network (FDM-Net). FDM-Net integrates a novel MSFA-frequency-aware multi-head self-attention mechanism (MaFormer) and a filter-based Fourier zero-padding method to reconstruct high pass components with greater difficulty and low pass components with relative ease, separately. The advantage of Maformer is that it can leverage the MSFA information and non-local dependencies present in the data. Additionally, we introduce a joint spatial and frequency loss to transfer MSFA information and enhance training on frequency components that are hard to recover. Our experimental results demonstrate that FDM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 6dB PSNR, and reconstructs high-fidelity details successfully.
