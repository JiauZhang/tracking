**Title:** Judgments of research co-created by generative AI: experimental evidence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11873  
**Abstract:** The introduction of ChatGPT has fuelled a public debate on the use of generative AI (large language models; LLMs), including its use by researchers. In the current work, we test whether delegating parts of the research process to LLMs leads people to distrust and devalue researchers and scientific output. Participants (N=402) considered a researcher who delegates elements of the research process to a PhD student or LLM, and rated (1) moral acceptability, (2) trust in the scientist to oversee future projects, and (3) the accuracy and quality of the output. People judged delegating to an LLM as less acceptable than delegating to a human (d = -0.78). Delegation to an LLM also decreased trust to oversee future research projects (d = -0.80), and people thought the results would be less accurate and of lower quality (d = -0.85). We discuss how this devaluation might transfer into the underreporting of generative AI use.

**Title:** Exploring the Efficacy of ChatGPT in Analyzing Student Teamwork Feedback  with an Existing Taxonomy  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11882  
**Abstract:** Teamwork is a critical component of many academic and professional settings. In those contexts, feedback between team members is an important element to facilitate successful and sustainable teamwork. However, in the classroom, as the number of teams and team members and frequency of evaluation increase, the volume of comments can become overwhelming for an instructor to read and track, making it difficult to identify patterns and areas for student improvement. To address this challenge, we explored the use of generative AI models, specifically ChatGPT, to analyze student comments in team based learning contexts. Our study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to accurately identify topics in student comments based on an existing framework consisting of positive and negative comments. Our results suggest that ChatGPT can achieve over 90\% accuracy in labeling student comments, providing a potentially valuable tool for analyzing feedback in team projects. This study contributes to the growing body of research on the use of AI models in educational contexts and highlights the potential of ChatGPT for facilitating analysis of student comments.

**Title:** Taking Advice from ChatGPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11888  
**Abstract:** A growing literature studies how humans incorporate advice from algorithms. This study examines an algorithm with millions of daily users: ChatGPT. We conduct a lab experiment in which 188 student participants answer 2,828 multiple-choice questions across 25 academic subjects. We present participants with answers from a GPT model and allow them to update their initial responses. We find that the advisor's identity ("AI chatbot" versus a human "expert"), presence of written justification, and advice correctness do not significant affect weight on advice. Instead, we show that participants weigh advice more heavily if they (1) are unfamiliar with the topic, (2) used ChatGPT in the past, or (3) received more accurate advice previously. These three effects -- task difficulty, algorithm familiarity, and experience, respectively -- appear to be stronger with an AI chatbot as the advisor. Moreover, we find that participants are able to place greater weight on correct advice only when written justifications are provided. In a parallel analysis, we find that the student participants are miscalibrated and significantly underestimate the accuracy of ChatGPT on 10 of 25 topics. Students under-weigh advice by over 50% and would have scored better if they trusted ChatGPT more.

**Title:** Enhancing Chemistry Learning with ChatGPT and Bing Chat as Agents to  Think With: A Comparative Case Study  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11890  
**Abstract:** This study explores the potential of Generative AI chatbots (GenAIbots) such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat, in Chemistry education, within a constructionist theoretical framework. A single-case study methodology was used to analyse extensive interaction logs between students and both AI systems in simulated Chemistry learning experiences. The results highlight the ability of ChatGPT and Bing Chat to act as 'agents-to-think-with', fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, concept comprehension, creativity, and personalised learning experiences. By employing a Socratic-like questioning approach, GenAIbots nurture students' curiosity and promote active learning. The study emphasises the significance of prompt crafting, a technique to elicit desired responses from GenAIbots, fostering iterative reflections and interactions. It underlines the need for comprehensive educator training to effectively integrate these tools into classrooms. The study concludes that while ChatGPT and Bing Chat as agents-to-think-with offer promising avenues to revolutionise STEM education through a constructionist lens, fostering a more interactive, inclusive learning environment and promoting deeper comprehension and critical thinking in students across diverse Chemistry topics, ChatGPT consistently outperformed Bing Chat, providing more comprehensive, detailed, and accurate responses and skillfully addressing nuances and context.

**Title:** A Unified Framework for Integrating Semantic Communication and  AI-Generated Content in Metaverse  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11911  
**Abstract:** As the Metaverse continues to grow, the need for efficient communication and intelligent content generation becomes increasingly important. Semantic communication focuses on conveying meaning and understanding from user inputs, while AI-Generated Content utilizes artificial intelligence to create digital content and experiences. Integrated Semantic Communication and AI-Generated Content (ISGC) has attracted a lot of attentions recently, which transfers semantic information from user inputs, generates digital content, and renders graphics for Metaverse. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that captures ISGC two primary benefits, including integration gain for optimized resource allocation and coordination gain for goal-oriented high-quality content generation to improve immersion from both communication and content perspectives. We also classify existing ISGC solutions, analyze the major components of ISGC, and present several use cases. We then construct a case study based on the diffusion model to identify an optimal resource allocation strategy for performing semantic extraction, content generation, and graphic rendering in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss several open research issues, encouraging further exploring the potential of ISGC and its related applications in the Metaverse.

**Title:** F-PABEE: Flexible-patience-based Early Exiting for Single-label and  Multi-label text Classification Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11916  
**Abstract:** Computational complexity and overthinking problems have become the bottlenecks for pre-training language models (PLMs) with millions or even trillions of parameters. A Flexible-Patience-Based Early Exiting method (F-PABEE) has been proposed to alleviate the problems mentioned above for single-label classification (SLC) and multi-label classification (MLC) tasks. F-PABEE makes predictions at the classifier and will exit early if predicted distributions of cross-layer are consecutively similar. It is more flexible than the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) early exiting method PABEE because it can simultaneously adjust the similarity score thresholds and the patience parameters. Extensive experiments show that: (1) F-PABEE makes a better speedup-accuracy balance than existing early exiting strategies on both SLC and MLC tasks. (2) F-PABEE achieves faster inference and better performances on different PLMs such as BERT and ALBERT. (3) F-PABEE-JSKD performs best for F-PABEE with different similarity measures.

**Title:** PASTS: Progress-Aware Spatio-Temporal Transformer Speaker For  Vision-and-Language Navigation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11918  
**Abstract:** Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a crucial but challenging cross-modal navigation task. One powerful technique to enhance the generalization performance in VLN is the use of an independent speaker model to provide pseudo instructions for data augmentation. However, current speaker models based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) lack the ability to attend to features relevant at different locations and time steps. To address this, we propose a novel progress-aware spatio-temporal transformer speaker (PASTS) model that uses the transformer as the core of the network. PASTS uses a spatio-temporal encoder to fuse panoramic representations and encode intermediate connections through steps. Besides, to avoid the misalignment problem that could result in incorrect supervision, a speaker progress monitor (SPM) is proposed to enable the model to estimate the progress of instruction generation and facilitate more fine-grained caption results. Additionally, a multifeature dropout (MFD) strategy is introduced to alleviate overfitting. The proposed PASTS is flexible to be combined with existing VLN models. The experimental results demonstrate that PASTS outperforms all existing speaker models and successfully improves the performance of previous VLN models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the standard Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset.

**Title:** Exploring the Viability of Synthetic Query Generation for Relevance  Prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11944  
**Abstract:** Query-document relevance prediction is a critical problem in Information Retrieval systems. This problem has increasingly been tackled using (pretrained) transformer-based models which are finetuned using large collections of labeled data. However, in specialized domains such as e-commerce and healthcare, the viability of this approach is limited by the dearth of large in-domain data. To address this paucity, recent methods leverage these powerful models to generate high-quality task and domain-specific synthetic data. Prior work has largely explored synthetic data generation or query generation (QGen) for Question-Answering (QA) and binary (yes/no) relevance prediction, where for instance, the QGen models are given a document, and trained to generate a query relevant to that document. However in many problems, we have a more fine-grained notion of relevance than a simple yes/no label. Thus, in this work, we conduct a detailed study into how QGen approaches can be leveraged for nuanced relevance prediction. We demonstrate that -- contrary to claims from prior works -- current QGen approaches fall short of the more conventional cross-domain transfer-learning approaches. Via empirical studies spanning 3 public e-commerce benchmarks, we identify new shortcomings of existing QGen approaches -- including their inability to distinguish between different grades of relevance. To address this, we introduce label-conditioned QGen models which incorporates knowledge about the different relevance. While our experiments demonstrate that these modifications help improve performance of QGen techniques, we also find that QGen approaches struggle to capture the full nuance of the relevance label space and as a result the generated queries are not faithful to the desired relevance label.

**Title:** Eye-SpatialNet: Spatial Information Extraction from Ophthalmology Notes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11948  
**Abstract:** We introduce an annotated corpus of 600 ophthalmology notes labeled with detailed spatial and contextual information of ophthalmic entities. We extend our previously proposed frame semantics-based spatial representation schema, Rad-SpatialNet, to represent spatial language in ophthalmology text, resulting in the Eye-SpatialNet schema. The spatially-grounded entities are findings, procedures, and drugs. To accurately capture all spatial details, we add some domain-specific elements in Eye-SpatialNet. The annotated corpus contains 1715 spatial triggers, 7308 findings, 2424 anatomies, and 9914 descriptors. To automatically extract the spatial information, we employ a two-turn question answering approach based on the transformer language model BERT. The results are promising, with F1 scores of 89.31, 74.86, and 88.47 for spatial triggers, Figure, and Ground frame elements, respectively. This is the first work to represent and extract a wide variety of clinical information in ophthalmology. Extracting detailed information can benefit ophthalmology applications and research targeted toward disease progression and screening.

**Title:** Self-QA: Unsupervised Knowledge Guided Language Model Alignment  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11952  
**Abstract:** Large-scale language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have gained attention for their impressive conversational and generative capabilities. However, the creation of supervised paired question-answering data for instruction tuning presents formidable challenges. This endeavor necessitates substantial human effort for data annotation and wrestles with issues concerning data quality, diversity, accuracy, and other related factors. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce an innovative framework named Self-QA, which replaces the traditional practice of human-written instruction seeds with a vast amount of unsupervised knowledge, enabling the model to generate a larger quantity of correct and domain-specific instruction data. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through experiments conducted on unsupervised corpora from various domains.

**Title:** Not All Semantics are Created Equal: Contrastive Self-supervised  Learning with Automatic Temperature Individualization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11965  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we aim to optimize a contrastive loss with individualized temperatures in a principled and systematic manner for self-supervised learning. The common practice of using a global temperature parameter $\tau$ ignores the fact that ``not all semantics are created equal", meaning that different anchor data may have different numbers of samples with similar semantics, especially when data exhibits long-tails. First, we propose a new robust contrastive loss inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), providing us an intuition about the effect of $\tau$ and a mechanism for automatic temperature individualization. Then, we propose an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimizing the robust contrastive loss with a provable convergence guarantee without using large mini-batch sizes. Theoretical and experimental results show that our algorithm automatically learns a suitable $\tau$ for each sample. Specifically, samples with frequent semantics use large temperatures to keep local semantic structures, while samples with rare semantics use small temperatures to induce more separable features. Our method not only outperforms prior strong baselines (e.g., SimCLR, CLIP) on unimodal and bimodal datasets with larger improvements on imbalanced data but also is less sensitive to hyper-parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first methodical approach to optimizing a contrastive loss with individualized temperatures.

**Title:** OL-Transformer: A Fast and Universal Surrogate Simulator for Optical  Multilayer Thin Film Structures  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11984  
**Abstract:** Deep learning-based methods have recently been established as fast and accurate surrogate simulators for optical multilayer thin film structures. However, existing methods only work for limited types of structures with different material arrangements, preventing their applications towards diverse and universal structures. Here, we propose the Opto-Layer (OL) Transformer to act as a universal surrogate simulator for enormous types of structures. Combined with the technique of structure serialization, our model can predict accurate reflection and transmission spectra for up to $10^{25}$ different multilayer structures, while still achieving a six-fold time speedup compared to physical solvers. Further investigation reveals that the general learning ability comes from the fact that our model first learns the physical embeddings and then uses the self-attention mechanism to capture the hidden relationship of light-matter interaction between each layer.

**Title:** Evaluation of medium-large Language Models at zero-shot closed book  generative question answering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11991  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention, but the definition of "large" lacks clarity. This paper focuses on medium-sized lan-guage models (MLMs), defined as having at least six billion parameters but less than 100 billion. The study evaluates MLMs regarding zero-shot genera-tive question answering, which requires models to provide elaborate answers without external document retrieval. The paper introduces an own test da-taset and presents results from human evaluation. Results show that combin-ing the best answers from different MLMs yielded an overall correct answer rate of 82.7% which is better than the 60.9% of ChatGPT. The best MLM achieved 46.4% and has 7B parameters, which highlights the importance of using appropriate training data for fine-tuning rather than solely relying on the number of parameters. More fine-grained feedback should be used to further improve the quality of answers.

**Title:** Advising OpenMP Parallelization via a Graph-Based Approach with  Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11999  
**Abstract:** There is an ever-present need for shared memory parallelization schemes to exploit the full potential of multi-core architectures. The most common parallelization API addressing this need today is OpenMP. Nevertheless, writing parallel code manually is complex and effort-intensive. Thus, many deterministic source-to-source (S2S) compilers have emerged, intending to automate the process of translating serial to parallel code. However, recent studies have shown that these compilers are impractical in many scenarios. In this work, we combine the latest advancements in the field of AI and natural language processing (NLP) with the vast amount of open-source code to address the problem of automatic parallelization. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, called OMPify, to detect and predict the OpenMP pragmas and shared-memory attributes in parallel code, given its serial version. OMPify is based on a Transformer-based model that leverages a graph-based representation of source code that exploits the inherent structure of code. We evaluated our tool by predicting the parallelization pragmas and attributes of a large corpus of (over 54,000) snippets of serial code written in C and C++ languages (Open-OMP-Plus). Our results demonstrate that OMPify outperforms existing approaches, the general-purposed and popular ChatGPT and targeted PragFormer models, in terms of F1 score and accuracy. Specifically, OMPify achieves up to 90% accuracy on commonly-used OpenMP benchmark tests such as NAS, SPEC, and PolyBench. Additionally, we performed an ablation study to assess the impact of different model components and present interesting insights derived from the study. Lastly, we also explored the potential of using data augmentation and curriculum learning techniques to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

**Title:** Clinical Camel: An Open-Source Expert-Level Medical Language Model with  Dialogue-Based Knowledge Encoding  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12031  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) present immense potential in the medical field, yet concerns over data privacy, regulatory compliance, and model stability restrict their widespread adoption. Although the distillation of high-performing closed-source LLMs has proven effective for general tasks, their application in healthcare is limited due to reduced domain knowledge and remnants of alignment behavior hindering clinical tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Dialogue-Based Knowledge Encoding (DBKE). DBKE enhances models' implicit knowledge base and primes them for conversational recall, augmenting their conversational capabilities and enabling a soft alignment for subsequent use cases. By transforming dense academic source text into synthetic dialogue, DBKE broadens the model's knowledge base and enables a soft alignment that guides downstream behaviours. We present Clinical Camel, an open-source, healthcare-focused conversational model, to showcase the effectiveness of DBKE. Clinical Camel outperforms GPT-3.5 on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 3 with scores of 53.2 % and 58.2 %, respectively, compared to GPT-3.5's scores of 36.1 % and 55.7 %. Clinical Camel adeptly handles multi-stage clinical case problems, provides adaptive counseling, and generates clinical notes. However, it is prone to hallucinations, which pose a significant obstacle in safety-critical settings. The performance of Clinical Camel underscores the importance of continued research and development of open-source models for the safe and effective integration of LLMs in healthcare settings.

**Title:** Stabilized finite element methods for the time-spectral  convection-diffusion equation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12038  
**Abstract:** Discretizing a solution in the Fourier domain rather than the time domain presents a significant advantage in solving transport problems that vary smoothly and periodically in time, such as cardiorespiratory flows. The finite element solution of the resulting time-spectral formulation is investigated here for the convection-diffusion equations. In addition to the baseline Galerkin's method, we consider stabilized approaches inspired by the streamline upwind Petrov/Galerkin (SUPG), least square (LSQ), and variational multiscale (VMS) methods. We also introduce a new augmented SUPG (ASU) method that, by design, produces a nodally exact solution in one dimension for piecewise linear interpolation functions. Comparing these five methods using 1D, 2D, and 3D canonical test cases shows while the ASU is most accurate overall, it exhibits convergence issues in extremely oscillatory flows with a high Womersley number in 3D. The VMS method presents an attractive alternative due to its excellent convergence characteristics and reasonable accuracy.

**Title:** Deep Learning Hydrodynamic Forecasting for Flooded Region Assessment in  Near-Real-Time (DL Hydro-FRAN)  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12052  
**Abstract:** Hydrodynamic flood modeling improves hydrologic and hydraulic prediction of storm events. However, the computationally intensive numerical solutions required for high-resolution hydrodynamics have historically prevented their implementation in near-real-time flood forecasting. This study examines whether several Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures are suitable for optimizing hydrodynamic flood models. Several pluvial flooding events were simulated in a low-relief high-resolution urban environment using a 2D HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model. These simulations were assembled into a training set for the DNNs, which were then used to forecast flooding depths and velocities. The DNNs' forecasts were compared to the hydrodynamic flood models, and showed good agreement, with a median RMSE of around 2 mm for cell flooding depths in the study area. The DNNs also improved forecast computation time significantly, with the DNNs providing forecasts between 34.2 and 72.4 times faster than conventional hydrodynamic models. The study area showed little change between HEC-RAS' Full Momentum Equations and Diffusion Equations, however, important numerical stability considerations were discovered that impact equation selection and DNN architecture configuration. Overall, the results from this study show that DNNs can greatly optimize hydrodynamic flood modeling, and enable near-real-time hydrodynamic flood forecasting.

**Title:** SneakyPrompt: Evaluating Robustness of Text-to-image Generative Models'  Safety Filters  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12082  
**Abstract:** Text-to-image generative models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL$\cdot$E 2 have attracted much attention since their publication due to their wide application in the real world. One challenging problem of text-to-image generative models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content, e.g., those related to violence and adult. Therefore, a common practice is to deploy a so-called safety filter, which blocks NSFW content based on either text or image features. Prior works have studied the possible bypass of such safety filters. However, existing works are largely manual and specific to Stable Diffusion's official safety filter. Moreover, the bypass ratio of Stable Diffusion's safety filter is as low as 23.51% based on our evaluation.

**Title:** Make Transformer Great Again for Time Series Forecasting: Channel  Aligned Robust Dual Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12095  
**Abstract:** Recent studies have demonstrated the great power of deep learning methods, particularly Transformer and MLP, for time series forecasting. Despite its success in NLP and CV, many studies found that Transformer is less effective than MLP for time series forecasting. In this work, we design a special Transformer, i.e., channel-aligned robust dual Transformer (CARD for short), that addresses key shortcomings of Transformer in time series forecasting. First, CARD introduces a dual Transformer structure that allows it to capture both temporal correlations among signals and dynamical dependence among multiple variables over time. Second, we introduce a robust loss function for time series forecasting to alleviate the potential overfitting issue. This new loss function weights the importance of forecasting over a finite horizon based on prediction uncertainties. Our evaluation of multiple long-term and short-term forecasting datasets demonstrates that CARD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods, including both Transformer and MLP-based models.

**Title:** The BEM and DRBEM schemes for the numerical solution of the  two-dimensional time-fractional diffusion-wave equations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12117  
**Abstract:** In this paper we apply the boundary elements method (BEM) and the dual reciprocity boundary elements method (DRBEM) for the numerical solution of two-dimensional time-fractional partial differential equations (TFPDEs). The fractional derivative of problem is described in the Caputo sense. In BEM, the main equation deduces to solving the Helmholtz equation in each time step. Therefore, we should compute the domain integral in each time step. So, we presented an approach to compute the domain integral with no singularity. On the other hand the DRBEM has the flexibility of discretizing only the boundary of the computational domain and evaluates the solution at any required interior point. We employ the radial basis functions (RBFs) for interpolation of the inhomogeneous and time derivative terms. The proposed method is employed for solving some problems in two--dimensions on unit square and some other complex regions to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

**Title:** The Scope of ChatGPT in Software Engineering: A Thorough Investigation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12138  
**Abstract:** ChatGPT demonstrates immense potential to transform software engineering (SE) by exhibiting outstanding performance in tasks such as code and document generation. However, the high reliability and risk control requirements of SE make the lack of interpretability for ChatGPT a concern. To address this issue, we carried out a study evaluating ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations in SE. We broke down the abilities needed for AI models to tackle SE tasks into three categories: 1) syntax understanding, 2) static behavior understanding, and 3) dynamic behavior understanding. Our investigation focused on ChatGPT's ability to comprehend code syntax and semantic structures, including abstract syntax trees (AST), control flow graphs (CFG), and call graphs (CG). We assessed ChatGPT's performance on cross-language tasks involving C, Java, Python, and Solidity. Our findings revealed that while ChatGPT excels at understanding code syntax (AST), it struggles with comprehending code semantics, particularly dynamic semantics. We conclude that ChatGPT possesses capabilities akin to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser, demonstrating initial competencies in static code analysis. Additionally, our study highlights that ChatGPT is susceptible to hallucination when interpreting code semantic structures and fabricating non-existent facts. These results underscore the need to explore methods for verifying the correctness of ChatGPT's outputs to ensure its dependability in SE. More importantly, our study provide an iniital answer why the generated codes from LLMs are usually synatx correct but vulnerabale.

**Title:** DiffCap: Exploring Continuous Diffusion on Image Captioning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12144  
**Abstract:** Current image captioning works usually focus on generating descriptions in an autoregressive manner. However, there are limited works that focus on generating descriptions non-autoregressively, which brings more decoding diversity. Inspired by the success of diffusion models on generating natural-looking images, we propose a novel method DiffCap to apply continuous diffusions on image captioning. Unlike image generation where the output is fixed-size and continuous, image description length varies with discrete tokens. Our method transforms discrete tokens in a natural way and applies continuous diffusion on them to successfully fuse extracted image features for diffusion caption generation. Our experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate that our method uses a much simpler structure to achieve comparable results to the previous non-autoregressive works. Apart from quality, an intriguing property of DiffCap is its high diversity during generation, which is missing from many autoregressive models. We believe our method on fusing multimodal features in diffusion language generation will inspire more researches on multimodal language generation tasks for its simplicity and decoding flexibility.

**Title:** LogiCoT: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction-Tuning Data Collection  with GPT-4  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12147  
**Abstract:** Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) demonstrates impressive chain-of-thought reasoning ability. Recent work on self-instruction tuning, such as Alpaca, has focused on enhancing the general proficiency of models. These instructions enable the model to achieve performance comparable to GPT-3.5 on general tasks like open-domain text generation and paraphrasing. However, they fall short of helping the model handle complex reasoning tasks. To bridge the gap, this paper presents LogiCoT, a new instruction-tuning dataset for Logical Chain-of-Thought reasoning with GPT-4. We elaborate on the process of harvesting instructions for prompting GPT-4 to generate chain-of-thought rationales. LogiCoT serves as an instruction set for teaching models of logical reasoning and elicits general reasoning skills.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12171  
**Abstract:** Modeling multimodal human behavior accurately has been a key barrier to increasing the level of interaction between human and robot, particularly for collaborative tasks. Our key insight is that the predictive accuracy of human behaviors on physical tasks is bottlenecked by the model for methods involving human behavior prediction. We present a method for training denoising diffusion probabilistic models on a dataset of collaborative human-human demonstrations and conditioning on past human partner actions to plan sequences of robot actions that synergize well with humans during test time. We demonstrate the method outperforms other state-of-art learning methods on human-robot table-carrying, a continuous state-action task, in both simulation and real settings with a human in the loop. Moreover, we qualitatively highlight compelling robot behaviors that arise during evaluations that demonstrate evidence of true human-robot collaboration, including mutual adaptation, shared task understanding, leadership switching, learned partner behaviors, and low levels of wasteful interaction forces arising from dissent.

**Abstract:** Can large language models be used to complete mathematical tasks that are traditionally performed either manually or with the aid of theorem provers? To answer this question, a state-of-the-art system, GPT-4, was provided with a concise natural language specification for a previously unpublished formal system and asked to complete a number of tasks, from stating function and type definitions to proving simple theorems and verifying user-supplied proofs. The system completed all tasks successfully, showed extensive domain knowledge, invented helpful new syntax and semantics, and exhibited generalization and inference abilities. So the answer seems to be: yes.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12199  
**Abstract:** The VNHSGE (VietNamese High School Graduation Examination) dataset, developed exclusively for evaluating large language models (LLMs), is introduced in this article. The dataset, which covers nine subjects, was generated from the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination and comparable tests. 300 literary essays have been included, and there are over 19,000 multiple-choice questions on a range of topics. The dataset assesses LLMs in multitasking situations such as question answering, text generation, reading comprehension, visual question answering, and more by including both textual data and accompanying images. Using ChatGPT and BingChat, we evaluated LLMs on the VNHSGE dataset and contrasted their performance with that of Vietnamese students to see how well they performed. The results show that ChatGPT and BingChat both perform at a human level in a number of areas, including literature, English, history, geography, and civics education. They still have space to grow, though, especially in the areas of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. The VNHSGE dataset seeks to provide an adequate benchmark for assessing the abilities of LLMs with its wide-ranging coverage and variety of activities. We intend to promote future developments in the creation of LLMs by making this dataset available to the scientific community, especially in resolving LLMs' limits in disciplines involving mathematics and the natural sciences.

**Title:** Prompt ChatGPT In MNER: Improved multimodal named entity recognition  method based on auxiliary refining knowledge from ChatGPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12212  
**Abstract:** Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) on social media aims to enhance textual entity prediction by incorporating image-based clues. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on maximizing the utilization of potentially relevant information in images or incorporating external knowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs). However, these methods either neglect the necessity of providing the model with relevant external knowledge, or the retrieved external knowledge suffers from high redundancy. To address these problems, we propose a conceptually simple two-stage framework called Prompt ChatGPT In MNER (PGIM) in this paper. We leverage ChatGPT as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire auxiliary refined knowledge, thereby bolstering the model's performance in MNER tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a Multimodal Similar Example Awareness module to select suitable examples from a small number of manually annotated samples. These examples are then integrated into a formatted prompt template tailored to the MNER task, guiding ChatGPT to generate auxiliary refined knowledge. Finally, the acquired knowledge is integrated with the raw text and inputted into the downstream model for further processing. Extensive experiments show that our PGIM significantly outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods on two classic MNER datasets.

**Abstract:** We empirically investigate proper pre-training methods to build good visual tokenizers, making Large Language Models (LLMs) powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In our benchmark, which is curated to evaluate MLLMs visual semantic understanding and fine-grained perception capabilities, we discussed different visual tokenizers pre-trained with dominant methods (i.e., DeiT, CLIP, MAE, DINO), and observe that: i) Fully/weakly supervised models capture more semantics than self-supervised models, but the gap is narrowed by scaling up the pre-training dataset. ii) Self-supervised models are better at fine-grained perception, where patch-level supervision is particularly effective. iii) Tuning the visual tokenizer leads to the loss of semantics obtained from large-scale pretraining, which is unfavorable with relatively small-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Given the findings, we reviewed methods that attempted to unify semantics and fine-grained visual understanding, e.g., patch-level feature distillation with semantically-rich targets. We obtain an intriguing insight mask-based strategies that were once all the rage may not be applicable for obtaining good visual tokenizers. Based on this critical observation, we obtain a new MLLM equipped with a tailored Good Visual Tokenizer (GVT), which exhibits strong visual comprehension capability at multiple scales. In particular, without introducing extra parameters and task-specific fine-tuning, GVT achieves superior performance on visual question answering, image captioning, and other fine-grained visual understanding tasks such as object counting and multi-class identification.

**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Brand Logo  Classification in Real-World Scenarios  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12242  
**Abstract:** This report presents a comprehensive study on deep learning models for brand logo classification in real-world scenarios. The dataset contains 3,717 labeled images of logos from ten prominent brands. Two types of models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), were evaluated for their performance. The ViT model, DaViT small, achieved the highest accuracy of 99.60%, while the DenseNet29 achieved the fastest inference speed of 366.62 FPS. The findings suggest that the DaViT model is a suitable choice for offline applications due to its superior accuracy. This study demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in brand logo classification tasks.

**Title:** Boosting Human-Object Interaction Detection with Text-to-Image Diffusion  Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12252  
**Abstract:** This paper investigates the problem of the current HOI detection methods and introduces DiffHOI, a novel HOI detection scheme grounded on a pre-trained text-image diffusion model, which enhances the detector's performance via improved data diversity and HOI representation. We demonstrate that the internal representation space of a frozen text-to-image diffusion model is highly relevant to verb concepts and their corresponding context. Accordingly, we propose an adapter-style tuning method to extract the various semantic associated representation from a frozen diffusion model and CLIP model to enhance the human and object representations from the pre-trained detector, further reducing the ambiguity in interaction prediction. Moreover, to fill in the gaps of HOI datasets, we propose SynHOI, a class-balance, large-scale, and high-diversity synthetic dataset containing over 140K HOI images with fully triplet annotations. It is built using an automatic and scalable pipeline designed to scale up the generation of diverse and high-precision HOI-annotated data. SynHOI could effectively relieve the long-tail issue in existing datasets and facilitate learning interaction representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffHOI significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in regular detection (i.e., 41.50 mAP) and zero-shot detection. Furthermore, SynHOI can improve the performance of model-agnostic and backbone-agnostic HOI detection, particularly exhibiting an outstanding 11.55% mAP improvement in rare classes.

**Title:** SEntFiN 1.0: Entity-Aware Sentiment Analysis for Financial News  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12257  
**Abstract:** Fine-grained financial sentiment analysis on news headlines is a challenging task requiring human-annotated datasets to achieve high performance. Limited studies have tried to address the sentiment extraction task in a setting where multiple entities are present in a news headline. In an effort to further research in this area, we make publicly available SEntFiN 1.0, a human-annotated dataset of 10,753 news headlines with entity-sentiment annotations, of which 2,847 headlines contain multiple entities, often with conflicting sentiments. We augment our dataset with a database of over 1,000 financial entities and their various representations in news media amounting to over 5,000 phrases. We propose a framework that enables the extraction of entity-relevant sentiments using a feature-based approach rather than an expression-based approach. For sentiment extraction, we utilize 12 different learning schemes utilizing lexicon-based and pre-trained sentence representations and five classification approaches. Our experiments indicate that lexicon-based n-gram ensembles are above par with pre-trained word embedding schemes such as GloVe. Overall, RoBERTa and finBERT (domain-specific BERT) achieve the highest average accuracy of 94.29% and F1-score of 93.27%. Further, using over 210,000 entity-sentiment predictions, we validate the economic effect of sentiments on aggregate market movements over a long duration.

**Title:** Autoregressive Modeling with Lookahead Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12272  
**Abstract:** To predict the next token, autoregressive models ordinarily examine the past. Could they also benefit from also examining hypothetical futures? We consider a novel Transformer-based autoregressive architecture that estimates the next-token distribution by extrapolating multiple continuations of the past, according to some proposal distribution, and attending to these extended strings. This architecture draws insights from classical AI systems such as board game players: when making a local decision, a policy may benefit from exploring possible future trajectories and analyzing them. On multiple tasks including morphological inflection and Boolean satisfiability, our lookahead model is able to outperform the ordinary Transformer model of comparable size. However, on some tasks, it appears to be benefiting from the extra computation without actually using the lookahead information. We discuss possible variant architectures as well as future speedups.

**Title:** Contextualizing Argument Quality Assessment with Relevant Knowledge  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12280  
**Abstract:** Automatic assessment of the quality of arguments has been recognized as a challenging task with significant implications for misinformation and targeted speech. While real world arguments are tightly anchored in context, existing efforts to judge argument quality analyze arguments in isolation, ultimately failing to accurately assess arguments. We propose SPARK: a novel method for scoring argument quality based on contextualization via relevant knowledge. We devise four augmentations that leverage large language models to provide feedback, infer hidden assumptions, supply a similar-quality argument, or a counterargument. We use a dual-encoder Transformer architecture to enable the original argument and its augmentation to be considered jointly. Our experiments in both in-domain and zero-shot setups show that SPARK consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We make our code available to encourage further work on argument assessment.

**Title:** Revisiting the Architectures like Pointer Networks to Efficiently  Improve the Next Word Distribution, Summarization Factuality, and Beyond  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12289  
**Abstract:** Is the output softmax layer, which is adopted by most language models (LMs), always the best way to compute the next word probability? Given so many attention layers in a modern transformer-based LM, are the pointer networks redundant nowadays? In this study, we discover that the answers to both questions are no. This is because the softmax bottleneck sometimes prevents the LMs from predicting the desired distribution and the pointer networks can be used to break the bottleneck efficiently. Based on the finding, we propose several softmax alternatives by simplifying the pointer networks and accelerating the word-by-word rerankers. In GPT-2, our proposals are significantly better and more efficient than mixture of softmax, a state-of-the-art softmax alternative. In summarization experiments, without significantly decreasing its training/testing speed, our best method based on T5-Small improves factCC score by 2 points in CNN/DM and XSUM dataset, and improves MAUVE scores by 30% in BookSum paragraph-level dataset.

**Title:** InstructVid2Vid: Controllable Video Editing with Natural Language  Instructions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12328  
**Abstract:** We present an end-to-end diffusion-based method for editing videos with human language instructions, namely $\textbf{InstructVid2Vid}$. Our approach enables the editing of input videos based on natural language instructions without any per-example fine-tuning or inversion. The proposed InstructVid2Vid model combines a pretrained image generation model, Stable Diffusion, with a conditional 3D U-Net architecture to generate time-dependent sequence of video frames. To obtain the training data, we incorporate the knowledge and expertise of different models, including ChatGPT, BLIP, and Tune-a-Video, to synthesize video-instruction triplets, which is a more cost-efficient alternative to collecting data in real-world scenarios. To improve the consistency between adjacent frames of generated videos, we propose the Frame Difference Loss, which is incorporated during the training process. During inference, we extend the classifier-free guidance to text-video input to guide the generated results, making them more related to both the input video and instruction. Experiments demonstrate that InstructVid2Vid is able to generate high-quality, temporally coherent videos and perform diverse edits, including attribute editing, change of background, and style transfer. These results highlight the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method. Code is released in $\href{https://github.com/BrightQin/InstructVid2Vid}{InstructVid2Vid}$.

**Title:** Task-agnostic Distillation of Encoder-Decoder Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12330  
**Abstract:** Finetuning pretrained language models (LMs) have enabled appealing performance on a diverse array of tasks. The intriguing task-agnostic property has driven a shifted focus from task-specific to task-agnostic distillation of LMs. While task-agnostic, compute-efficient, performance-preserved LMs can be yielded by task-agnostic distillation, previous studies mainly sit in distillation of either encoder-only LMs (e.g., BERT) or decoder-only ones (e.g., GPT) yet largely neglect that distillation of encoder-decoder LMs (e.g., T5) can posit very distinguished behaviors. Frustratingly, we discover that existing task-agnostic distillation methods can fail to handle the distillation of encoder-decoder LMs. To the demand, we explore a few paths and uncover a path named as MiniEnD that successfully tackles the distillation of encoder-decoder LMs in a task-agnostic fashion. We examine MiniEnD on language understanding and abstractive summarization. The results showcase that MiniEnD is generally effective and is competitive compared to other alternatives. We further scale MiniEnD up to distillation of 3B encoder-decoder language models with interpolated distillation. The results imply the opportunities and challenges in distilling large language models (e.g., LLaMA).

**Title:** Temporal Fusion Transformers for Streamflow Prediction: Value of  Combining Attention with Recurrence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12335  
**Abstract:** Over the past few decades, the hydrology community has witnessed notable advancements in streamflow prediction, particularly with the introduction of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms. Recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have become popular due to their capacity to create precise forecasts and realistically mimic the system dynamics. Attention-based models, such as Transformers, can learn from the entire data sequence concurrently, a feature that LSTM does not have. This work tests the hypothesis that combining recurrence with attention can improve streamflow prediction. We set up the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) architecture, a model that combines both of these aspects and has never been applied in hydrology before. We compare the performance of LSTM, Transformers, and TFT over 2,610 globally distributed catchments from the recently available Caravan dataset. Our results demonstrate that TFT indeed exceeds the performance benchmark set by the LSTM and Transformers for streamflow prediction. Additionally, being an explainable AI method, TFT helps in gaining insights into the streamflow generation processes.

**Title:** Bi-ViT: Pushing the Limit of Vision Transformer Quantization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12354  
**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) quantization offers a promising prospect to facilitate deploying large pre-trained networks on resource-limited devices. Fully-binarized ViTs (Bi-ViT) that pushes the quantization of ViTs to its limit remain largely unexplored and a very challenging task yet, due to their unacceptable performance. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify the severe drop in ViT binarization is caused by attention distortion in self-attention, which technically stems from the gradient vanishing and ranking disorder. To address these issues, we first introduce a learnable scaling factor to reactivate the vanished gradients and illustrate its effectiveness through theoretical and experimental analyses. We then propose a ranking-aware distillation method to rectify the disordered ranking in a teacher-student framework. Bi-ViT achieves significant improvements over popular DeiT and Swin backbones in terms of Top-1 accuracy and FLOPs. For example, with DeiT-Tiny and Swin-Tiny, our method significantly outperforms baselines by 22.1% and 21.4% respectively, while 61.5x and 56.1x theoretical acceleration in terms of FLOPs compared with real-valued counterparts on ImageNet.

**Title:** HIINT: Historical, Intra- and Inter- personal Dynamics Modeling with  Cross-person Memory Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12369  
**Abstract:** Accurately modeling affect dynamics, which refers to the changes and fluctuations in emotions and affective displays during human conversations, is crucial for understanding human interactions. By analyzing affect dynamics, we can gain insights into how people communicate, respond to different situations, and form relationships. However, modeling affect dynamics is challenging due to contextual factors, such as the complex and nuanced nature of interpersonal relationships, the situation, and other factors that influence affective displays. To address this challenge, we propose a Cross-person Memory Transformer (CPM-T) framework which is able to explicitly model affective dynamics (intrapersonal and interpersonal influences) by identifying verbal and non-verbal cues, and with a large language model to utilize the pre-trained knowledge and perform verbal reasoning. The CPM-T framework maintains memory modules to store and update the contexts within the conversation window, enabling the model to capture dependencies between earlier and later parts of a conversation. Additionally, our framework employs cross-modal attention to effectively align information from multi-modalities and leverage cross-person attention to align behaviors in multi-party interactions. We evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach on three publicly available datasets for joint engagement, rapport, and human beliefs prediction tasks. Remarkably, the CPM-T framework outperforms baseline models in average F1-scores by up to 7.3%, 9.3%, and 2.0% respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of each component in the framework via ablation studies with respect to multimodal temporal behavior.

**Title:** Constrastive Language-Image Pretrained Models are Zero-Shot Human  Scanpath Predictors  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12380  
**Abstract:** Understanding the mechanisms underlying human attention is a fundamental challenge for both vision science and artificial intelligence. While numerous computational models of free-viewing have been proposed, less is known about the mechanisms underlying task-driven image exploration. To address this gap, we present CapMIT1003, a database of captions and click-contingent image explorations collected during captioning tasks. CapMIT1003 is based on the same stimuli from the well-known MIT1003 benchmark, for which eye-tracking data under free-viewing conditions is available, which offers a promising opportunity to concurrently study human attention under both tasks. We make this dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in this field. In addition, we introduce NevaClip, a novel zero-shot method for predicting visual scanpaths that combines contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) models with biologically-inspired neural visual attention (NeVA) algorithms. NevaClip simulates human scanpaths by aligning the representation of the foveated visual stimulus and the representation of the associated caption, employing gradient-driven visual exploration to generate scanpaths. Our experimental results demonstrate that NevaClip outperforms existing unsupervised computational models of human visual attention in terms of scanpath plausibility, for both captioning and free-viewing tasks. Furthermore, we show that conditioning NevaClip with incorrect or misleading captions leads to random behavior, highlighting the significant impact of caption guidance in the decision-making process. These findings contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms that guide human attention and pave the way for more sophisticated computational approaches to scanpath prediction that can integrate direct top-down guidance of downstream tasks.

**Title:** PiVe: Prompting with Iterative Verification Improving Graph-based  Generative Capability of LLMs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12392  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown great abilities of solving various natural language tasks in different domains. Due to the training objective of LLMs and their pretraining data, LLMs are not very well equipped for tasks involving structured data generation. We propose a framework, Prompting with Iterative Verification (PiVe), to improve graphbased generative capability of LLMs. We show how a small language model could be trained to act as a verifier module for the output of an LLM (i.e., ChatGPT), and to iteratively improve its performance via fine-grained corrective instructions. Additionally, we show how the verifier module could apply iterative corrections offline for a more cost-effective solution to the text-to-graph generation task. Experiments on three graph-based datasets show consistent improvement gained via PiVe. Additionally, we highlight how the proposed verifier module can be used as a data augmentation tool to help improve the quality of automatically generated parallel text-graph datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/PiVe.

**Title:** Pruning Pre-trained Language Models with Principled Importance and  Self-regularization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12394  
**Abstract:** Iterative pruning is one of the most effective compression methods for pre-trained language models. We discovered that finding the optimal pruning decision is an equality-constrained 0-1 Integer Linear Programming problem. The solution to this optimization problem leads to a principled importance criterion which we use to rank parameters during iterative model pruning. To mitigate the poor generalization at high sparsity levels, we propose a self-regularization scheme where model prediction is regularized by the latest checkpoint with increasing sparsity throughout pruning. Our experiments on natural language understanding, question-answering, named entity recognition, and data-to-text generation with various Transformer-based PLMs show the effectiveness of the approach at various sparsity levels.

**Title:** Spatio-temporal Diffusion Point Processes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12403  
**Abstract:** Spatio-temporal point process (STPP) is a stochastic collection of events accompanied with time and space. Due to computational complexities, existing solutions for STPPs compromise with conditional independence between time and space, which consider the temporal and spatial distributions separately. The failure to model the joint distribution leads to limited capacities in characterizing the spatio-temporal entangled interactions given past events. In this work, we propose a novel parameterization framework for STPPs, which leverages diffusion models to learn complex spatio-temporal joint distributions. We decompose the learning of the target joint distribution into multiple steps, where each step can be faithfully described by a Gaussian distribution. To enhance the learning of each step, an elaborated spatio-temporal co-attention module is proposed to capture the interdependence between the event time and space adaptively. For the first time, we break the restrictions on spatio-temporal dependencies in existing solutions, and enable a flexible and accurate modeling paradigm for STPPs. Extensive experiments from a wide range of fields, such as epidemiology, seismology, crime, and urban mobility, demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines remarkably, with an average improvement of over 50%. Further in-depth analyses validate its ability to capture spatio-temporal interactions, which can learn adaptively for different scenarios. The datasets and source code are available online: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Spatio-temporal-Diffusion-Point-Processes.

**Title:** DiffUCD:Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Change Detection with Semantic  Correlation Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12410  
**Abstract:** Hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD) has emerged as a crucial research area in remote sensing due to its ability to detect subtle changes on the earth's surface. Recently, diffusional denoising probabilistic models (DDPM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the generative domain. Apart from their image generation capability, the denoising process in diffusion models can comprehensively account for the semantic correlation of spectral-spatial features in HSI, resulting in the retrieval of semantically relevant features in the original image. In this work, we extend the diffusion model's application to the HSI-CD field and propose a novel unsupervised HSI-CD with semantic correlation diffusion model (DiffUCD). Specifically, the semantic correlation diffusion model (SCDM) leverages abundant unlabeled samples and fully accounts for the semantic correlation of spectral-spatial features, which mitigates pseudo change between multi-temporal images arising from inconsistent imaging conditions. Besides, objects with the same semantic concept at the same spatial location may exhibit inconsistent spectral signatures at different times, resulting in pseudo change. To address this problem, we propose a cross-temporal contrastive learning (CTCL) mechanism that aligns the spectral feature representations of unchanged samples. By doing so, the spectral difference invariant features caused by environmental changes can be obtained. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa Coefficient (KC), and F1 scores, achieving improvements of approximately 3.95%, 8.13%, and 4.45%, respectively. Notably, our method can achieve comparable results to those fully supervised methods requiring numerous annotated samples.

Our model encodes and fuses the geometry of a scene with vision-language trained latent features by distilling information from a language-driven segmentation model. VL-Fields is trained without requiring any prior knowledge of the scene object classes, which makes it a promising representation for the field of robotics. Our model outperformed the similar CLIP-Fields model in the task of semantic segmentation by almost 10%.

**Title:** BiasAsker: Measuring the Bias in Conversational AI System  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12434  
**Abstract:** Powered by advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, conversational AI systems, such as ChatGPT and digital assistants like Siri, have been widely deployed in daily life. However, such systems may still produce content containing biases and stereotypes, causing potential social problems. Due to the data-driven, black-box nature of modern AI techniques, comprehensively identifying and measuring biases in conversational systems remains a challenging task. Particularly, it is hard to generate inputs that can comprehensively trigger potential bias due to the lack of data containing both social groups as well as biased properties. In addition, modern conversational systems can produce diverse responses (e.g., chatting and explanation), which makes existing bias detection methods simply based on the sentiment and the toxicity hardly being adopted. In this paper, we propose BiasAsker, an automated framework to identify and measure social bias in conversational AI systems. To obtain social groups and biased properties, we construct a comprehensive social bias dataset, containing a total of 841 groups and 8,110 biased properties. Given the dataset, BiasAsker automatically generates questions and adopts a novel method based on existence measurement to identify two types of biases (i.e., absolute bias and related bias) in conversational systems. Extensive experiments on 8 commercial systems and 2 famous research models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-3, show that 32.83% of the questions generated by BiasAsker can trigger biased behaviors in these widely deployed conversational systems. All the code, data, and experimental results have been released to facilitate future research.

**Title:** A variational multiscale method derived from an adaptive stabilized  conforming finite element method via residual minimization on dual norms  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12454  
**Abstract:** This paper interprets the stabilized finite element method via residual minimization as a variational multiscale method. We approximate the solution to the partial differential equations using two discrete spaces that we build on a triangulation of the domain; we denote these spaces as coarse and enriched spaces. Building on the adaptive stabilized finite element method via residual minimization, we find a coarse-scale approximation in a continuous space by minimizing the residual on a dual discontinuous Galerkin norm; this process allows us to compute a robust error estimate to construct an on-the-fly adaptive method. We reinterpret the residual projection using the variational multiscale framework to derive a fine-scale approximation. As a result, on each mesh of the adaptive process, we obtain stable coarse- and fine-scale solutions derived from a symmetric saddle-point formulation and an a-posteriori error indicator to guide automatic adaptivity. We test our framework in several challenging scenarios for linear and nonlinear convection-dominated diffusion problems to demonstrate the framework's performance in providing stability in the solution with optimal convergence rates in the asymptotic regime and robust performance in the pre-asymptotic regime. Lastly, we introduce a heuristic dual-term contribution in the variational form to improve the full-scale approximation for symmetric formulations (e.g., diffusion problem).

**Title:** Infor-Coef: Information Bottleneck-based Dynamic Token Downsampling for  Compact and Efficient language model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12458  
**Abstract:** The prevalence of Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) has led to their wide adoption for various natural language processing tasks. However, their excessive overhead leads to large latency and computational costs. The statically compression methods allocate fixed computation to different samples, resulting in redundant computation. The dynamic token pruning method selectively shortens the sequences but are unable to change the model size and hardly achieve the speedups as static pruning. In this paper, we propose a model accelaration approaches for large language models that incorporates dynamic token downsampling and static pruning, optimized by the information bottleneck loss. Our model, Infor-Coef, achieves an 18x FLOPs speedup with an accuracy degradation of less than 8\% compared to BERT. This work provides a promising approach to compress and accelerate transformer-based models for NLP tasks.

**Title:** Evaluating the Performance of Large Language Models on GAOKAO Benchmark  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12474  
**Abstract:** Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks; however, their efficacy in more challenging and domain-specific tasks remains less explored. This paper introduces the GAOKAO-Benchmark (GAOKAO-Bench), an intuitive benchmark that employs questions from the Chinese Gaokao examination as test samples for evaluating large language models.In order to align the evaluation results with humans as much as possible, we designed a method based on zero-shot prompts to analyze the accuracy and scoring rate of the model by dividing the questions into subjective and objective types. We evaluated the ChatGPT model on GAOKAO-Benchmark performance.Our findings reveal that the ChatGPT model excels in tackling objective questions, while also shedding light on its shortcomings and areas for improvement. To further scrutinize the model's responses, we incorporate human evaluations.In conclusion, this research contributes a robust evaluation benchmark for future large-scale language models and offers valuable insights into the limitations of such models.

**Title:** Zero-shot Visual Relation Detection via Composite Visual Cues from Large  Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12476  
**Abstract:** Pretrained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities, making them promising tools in the realm of zero-shot visual recognition. Visual relation detection (VRD) is a typical task that identifies relationship (or interaction) types between object pairs within an image. However, naively utilizing CLIP with prevalent class-based prompts for zero-shot VRD has several weaknesses, e.g., it struggles to distinguish between different fine-grained relation types and it neglects essential spatial information of two objects. To this end, we propose a novel method for zero-shot VRD: RECODE, which solves RElation detection via COmposite DEscription prompts. Specifically, RECODE first decomposes each predicate category into subject, object, and spatial components. Then, it leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate description-based prompts (or visual cues) for each component. Different visual cues enhance the discriminability of similar relation categories from different perspectives, which significantly boosts performance in VRD. To dynamically fuse different cues, we further introduce a chain-of-thought method that prompts LLMs to generate reasonable weights for different visual cues. Extensive experiments on four VRD benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and interpretability of RECODE.

**Title:** GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4: Evaluating ChatGPT's Reasoning Performance in  Zero-shot Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12477  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is a current hot debate regarding their reasoning capacity. In this paper, we examine the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, by performing a thorough technical evaluation on different reasoning tasks across eleven distinct datasets. Our findings show that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in zero-shot learning throughout almost all evaluated tasks. In addition, we note that both models exhibit limited performance in Inductive, Mathematical, and Multi-hop Reasoning Tasks. While it may seem intuitive that the GPT-4 model would outperform GPT-3.5 given its size and efficiency in various NLP tasks, our paper offers empirical evidence to support this claim. We provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the results from both models to further support our findings. In addition, we propose a set of engineered prompts that improves performance of both models on zero-shot learning.

**Title:** PanoContext-Former: Panoramic Total Scene Understanding with a  Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12497  
**Abstract:** Panoramic image enables deeper understanding and more holistic perception of $360^\circ$ surrounding environment, which can naturally encode enriched scene context information compared to standard perspective image. Previous work has made lots of effort to solve the scene understanding task in a bottom-up form, thus each sub-task is processed separately and few correlations are explored in this procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel method using depth prior for holistic indoor scene understanding which recovers the objects' shapes, oriented bounding boxes and the 3D room layout simultaneously from a single panorama. In order to fully utilize the rich context information, we design a transformer-based context module to predict the representation and relationship among each component of the scene. In addition, we introduce a real-world dataset for scene understanding, including photo-realistic panoramas, high-fidelity depth images, accurately annotated room layouts, and oriented object bounding boxes and shapes. Experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous panoramic scene understanding methods in terms of both layout estimation and 3D object detection.

**Title:** Watermarking Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12502  
**Abstract:** The availability and accessibility of diffusion models (DMs) have significantly increased in recent years, making them a popular tool for analyzing and predicting the spread of information, behaviors, or phenomena through a population. Particularly, text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., DALLE 2 and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and perform various image synthesis tasks. Despite their widespread adoption in many fields, DMs are often susceptible to various intellectual property violations. These can include not only copyright infringement but also more subtle forms of misappropriation, such as unauthorized use or modification of the model. Therefore, DM owners must be aware of these potential risks and take appropriate steps to protect their models. In this work, we are the first to protect the intellectual property of DMs. We propose a simple but effective watermarking scheme that injects the watermark into the DMs and can be verified by the pre-defined prompts. In particular, we propose two different watermarking methods, namely NAIVEWM and FIXEDWM. The NAIVEWM method injects the watermark into the LDMs and activates it using a prompt containing the watermark. On the other hand, the FIXEDWM is considered more advanced and stealthy compared to the NAIVEWM, as it can only activate the watermark when using a prompt containing a trigger in a fixed position. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of both approaches, demonstrating their effectiveness in watermark injection and verification with minimal impact on the LDM's functionality.

**Title:** PCF-GAN: generating sequential data via the characteristic function of  measures on the path space  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12511  
**Abstract:** Generating high-fidelity time series data using generative adversarial networks (GANs) remains a challenging task, as it is difficult to capture the temporal dependence of joint probability distributions induced by time-series data. Towards this goal, a key step is the development of an effective discriminator to distinguish between time series distributions. We propose the so-called PCF-GAN, a novel GAN that incorporates the path characteristic function (PCF) as the principled representation of time series distribution into the discriminator to enhance its generative performance. On the one hand, we establish theoretical foundations of the PCF distance by proving its characteristicity, boundedness, differentiability with respect to generator parameters, and weak continuity, which ensure the stability and feasibility of training the PCF-GAN. On the other hand, we design efficient initialisation and optimisation schemes for PCFs to strengthen the discriminative power and accelerate training efficiency. To further boost the capabilities of complex time series generation, we integrate the auto-encoder structure via sequential embedding into the PCF-GAN, which provides additional reconstruction functionality. Extensive numerical experiments on various datasets demonstrate the consistently superior performance of PCF-GAN over state-of-the-art baselines, in both generation and reconstruction quality. Code is available at https://github.com/DeepIntoStreams/PCF-GAN.

**Title:** GPT Paternity Test: GPT Generated Text Detection with GPT Genetic  Inheritance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12519  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate texts that carry the risk of various misuses, including plagiarism, planting fake reviews on e-commerce platforms, or creating fake social media postings that can sway election results. Detecting whether a text is machine-generated has thus become increasingly important. While machine-learning-based detection strategies exhibit superior performance, they often lack generalizability, limiting their practicality. In this work, we introduce GPT Paternity Test (GPT-Pat), which reliably detects machine-generated text across varied datasets. Given a text under scrutiny, we leverage ChatGPT to generate a corresponding question and provide a re-answer to the question. By comparing the similarity between the original text and the generated re-answered text, it can be determined whether the text is machine-generated. GPT-Pat consists of a Siamese network to compute the similarity between the original text and the generated re-answered text and a binary classifier. Our method achieved an average accuracy of 94.57% on four generalization test sets, surpassing the state-of-the-art RoBERTa-based method by 12.34%. The accuracy drop of our method is only about half of that of the RoBERTa-based method when it is attacked by re-translation and polishing.

**Title:** SLaDe: A Portable Small Language Model Decompiler for Optimized  Assembler  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12520  
**Abstract:** Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. We develop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to produce high-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 functions from AnghaBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe is up to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4 times more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.

**Title:** TheoremQA: A Theorem-driven Question Answering dataset  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12524  
**Abstract:** The recent LLMs like GPT-4 and PaLM-2 have made tremendous progress in solving fundamental math problems like GSM8K by achieving over 90\% accuracy. However, their capabilities to solve more challenging math problems which require domain-specific knowledge (i.e. theorem) have yet to be investigated. In this paper, we introduce TheoremQA, the first theorem-driven question-answering dataset designed to evaluate AI models' capabilities to apply theorems to solve challenging science problems. \dataset is curated by domain experts containing 800 high-quality questions covering 350 theorems\footnote{e.g. Taylor's theorem, Lagrange's theorem, Huffman coding, Quantum Theorem, Elasticity Theorem, etc} from Math, Physics, EE\&CS, and Finance. We evaluate a wide spectrum of 16 large language and code models with different prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thoughts and Program-of-Thoughts. We found that GPT-4's capabilities to solve these problems are unparalleled, achieving an accuracy of 51\% with Program-of-Thoughts Prompting. All the existing open-sourced models are below 15\%, barely surpassing the random-guess baseline. Given the diversity and broad coverage of \dataset, we believe it can be used as a better benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities to solve challenging science problems. The data and code are released in https://github.com/wenhuchen/TheoremQA.

**Title:** IR Models and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Study of Performance  and Challenges  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12528  
**Abstract:** This research study investigates the efficiency of different information retrieval (IR) systems in accessing relevant information from the scientific literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study applies the TREC framework to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and evaluates BM25, Contriever, and Bag of Embeddings IR frameworks. The objective is to build a test collection for search engines that tackle the complex information landscape during a pandemic. The study uses the CORD-19 dataset to train and evaluate the IR models and compares the results to those manually labeled in the TREC-COVID IR Challenge. The results indicate that advanced IR models like BERT and Contriever better retrieve relevant information during a pandemic. However, the study also highlights the challenges in processing large datasets and the need for strategies to focus on abstracts or summaries. Overall, the research highlights the importance of effectively tailored IR systems in dealing with information overload during crises like COVID-19 and can guide future research and development in this field.

**Title:** BertRLFuzzer: A BERT and Reinforcement Learning based Fuzzer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12534  
**Abstract:** We present a novel tool BertRLFuzzer, a BERT and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fuzzer aimed at finding security vulnerabilities. BertRLFuzzer works as follows: given a list of seed inputs, the fuzzer performs grammar-adhering and attack-provoking mutation operations on them to generate candidate attack vectors. The key insight of BertRLFuzzer is the combined use of two machine learning concepts. The first one is the use of semi-supervised learning with language models (e.g., BERT) that enables BertRLFuzzer to learn (relevant fragments of) the grammar of a victim application as well as attack patterns, without requiring the user to specify it explicitly. The second one is the use of RL with BERT model as an agent to guide the fuzzer to efficiently learn grammar-adhering and attack-provoking mutation operators. The RL-guided feedback loop enables BertRLFuzzer to automatically search the space of attack vectors to exploit the weaknesses of the given victim application without the need to create labeled training data. Furthermore, these two features together enable BertRLFuzzer to be extensible, i.e., the user can extend BertRLFuzzer to a variety of victim applications and attack vectors automatically (i.e., without explicitly modifying the fuzzer or providing a grammar).

**Title:** Explaining How Transformers Use Context to Build Predictions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12535  
**Abstract:** Language Generation Models produce words based on the previous context. Although existing methods offer input attributions as explanations for a model's prediction, it is still unclear how prior words affect the model's decision throughout the layers. In this work, we leverage recent advances in explainability of the Transformer and present a procedure to analyze models for language generation. Using contrastive examples, we compare the alignment of our explanations with evidence of the linguistic phenomena, and show that our method consistently aligns better than gradient-based and perturbation-based baselines. Then, we investigate the role of MLPs inside the Transformer and show that they learn features that help the model predict words that are grammatically acceptable. Lastly, we apply our method to Neural Machine Translation models, and demonstrate that they generate human-like source-target alignments for building predictions.

**Title:** Towards Globally Consistent Stochastic Human Motion Prediction via  Motion Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12554  
**Abstract:** Stochastic human motion prediction aims to predict multiple possible upcoming pose sequences based on past human motion trajectories. Prior works focused heavily on generating diverse motion samples, leading to inconsistent, abnormal predictions from the immediate past observations. To address this issue, in this work, we propose DiffMotion, a diffusion-based stochastic human motion prediction framework that considers both the kinematic structure of the human body and the globally temporally consistent nature of motion. Specifically, DiffMotion consists of two modules: 1) a transformer-based network for generating an initial motion reconstruction from corrupted motion, and 2) a multi-stage graph convolutional network to iteratively refine the generated motion based on past observations. Facilitated by the proposed direct target prediction objective and the variance scheduler, our method is capable of predicting accurate, realistic and consistent motion with an appropriate level of diversity. Our results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiffMotion outperforms previous methods by large margins in terms of accuracy and fidelity while demonstrating superior robustness.

**Title:** A Symbolic Framework for Systematic Evaluation of Mathematical Reasoning  with Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12563  
**Abstract:** Whether Transformers can learn to apply symbolic rules and generalise to out-of-distribution examples is an open research question. In this paper, we devise a data generation method for producing intricate mathematical derivations, and systematically perturb them with respect to syntax, structure, and semantics. Our task-agnostic approach generates equations, annotations, and inter-equation dependencies, employing symbolic algebra for scalable data production and augmentation. We then instantiate a general experimental framework on next-equation prediction, assessing systematic mathematical reasoning and generalisation of Transformer encoders on a total of 200K examples. The experiments reveal that perturbations heavily affect performance and can reduce F1 scores of $97\%$ to below $17\%$, suggesting that inference is dominated by surface-level patterns unrelated to a deeper understanding of mathematical operators. These findings underscore the importance of rigorous, large-scale evaluation frameworks for revealing fundamental limitations of existing models.

**Title:** ChatGPT Is More Likely to Be Perceived as Male Than Female  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12564  
**Abstract:** We investigate how people perceive ChatGPT, and, in particular, how they assign human-like attributes such as gender to the chatbot. Across five pre-registered studies (N = 1,552), we find that people are more likely to perceive ChatGPT to be male than female. Specifically, people perceive male gender identity (1) following demonstrations of ChatGPT's core abilities (e.g., providing information or summarizing text), (2) in the absence of such demonstrations, and (3) across different methods of eliciting perceived gender (using various scales and asking to name ChatGPT). Moreover, we find that this seemingly default perception of ChatGPT as male can reverse when ChatGPT's feminine-coded abilities are highlighted (e.g., providing emotional support for a user).

**Title:** GMD: Controllable Human Motion Synthesis via Guided Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12577  
**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion models have shown great promise in human motion synthesis conditioned on natural language descriptions. However, it remains a challenge to integrate spatial constraints, such as pre-defined motion trajectories and obstacles, which is essential for bridging the gap between isolated human motion and its surrounding environment. To address this issue, we propose Guided Motion Diffusion (GMD), a method that incorporates spatial constraints into the motion generation process. Specifically, we propose an effective feature projection scheme that largely enhances the coherency between spatial information and local poses. Together with a new imputation formulation, the generated motion can reliably conform to spatial constraints such as global motion trajectories. Furthermore, given sparse spatial constraints (e.g. sparse keyframes), we introduce a new dense guidance approach that utilizes the denoiser of diffusion models to turn a sparse signal into denser signals, effectively guiding the generation motion to the given constraints. The extensive experiments justify the development of GMD, which achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in text-based motion generation while being able to control the synthesized motions with spatial constraints.

**Title:** A Framework for Bidirectional Decoding: Case Study in Morphological  Inflection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12580  
**Abstract:** Transformer-based encoder-decoder models that generate outputs in a left-to-right fashion have become standard for sequence-to-sequence tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework for decoding that produces sequences from the "outside-in": at each step, the model chooses to generate a token on the left, on the right, or join the left and right sequences. We argue that this is more principled than prior bidirectional decoders. Our proposal supports a variety of model architectures and includes several training methods, such as a dynamic programming algorithm that marginalizes out the latent ordering variable. Our model improves considerably over a simple baseline based on unidirectional transformers on the SIGMORPHON 2023 inflection task and sets SOTA on the 2022 shared task. The model performs particularly well on long sequences, can learn the split point of words composed of stem and affix (without supervision), and performs better relative to the baseline on datasets that have fewer unique lemmas (but more examples per lemma).

**Title:** iWarpGAN: Disentangling Identity and Style to Generate Synthetic Iris  Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12596  
**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown success in approximating complex distributions for synthetic image generation and for editing specific portions of an input image, particularly in faces. However, current GAN-based methods for generating biometric images, such as iris, have limitations in controlling the identity of the generated images, i.e., the synthetically generated images often closely resemble images in the training dataset. Further, the generated images often lack diversity in terms of the number of unique identities represented in them. To overcome these issues, we propose iWarpGAN that disentangles identity and style in the context of the iris modality by using two transformation pathways: Identity Transformation Pathway to generate unique identities from the training set, and Style Transformation Pathway to extract the style code from a reference image and output an iris image using this style. By concatenating the transformed identity code and reference style code, iWarpGAN generates iris images with both inter and intra-class variations. The efficacy of the proposed method in generating Iris DeepFakes is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using ISO/IEC 29794-6 Standard Quality Metrics and the VeriEye iris matcher. Finally, the utility of the synthetically generated images is demonstrated by improving the performance of multiple deep learning based iris matchers that augment synthetic data with real data during the training process.

**Title:** Duplex Diffusion Models Improve Speech-to-Speech Translation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12628  
**Abstract:** Speech-to-speech translation is a typical sequence-to-sequence learning task that naturally has two directions. How to effectively leverage bidirectional supervision signals to produce high-fidelity audio for both directions? Existing approaches either train two separate models or a multitask-learned model with low efficiency and inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a duplex diffusion model that applies diffusion probabilistic models to both sides of a reversible duplex Conformer, so that either end can simultaneously input and output a distinct language's speech. Our model enables reversible speech translation by simply flipping the input and output ends. Experiments show that our model achieves the first success of reversible speech translation with significant improvements of ASR-BLEU scores compared with a list of state-of-the-art baselines.

**Title:** Exploring Energy-based Language Models with Different Architectures and  Training Methods for Speech Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12676  
**Abstract:** Energy-based language models (ELMs) parameterize an unnormalized distribution for natural sentences and are radically different from popular autoregressive language models (ALMs). As an important application, ELMs have been successfully used as a means for calculating sentence scores in speech recognition, but they all use less-modern CNN or LSTM networks. The recent progress in Transformer networks and large pretrained models such as BERT and GPT2 opens new possibility to further advancing ELMs. In this paper, we explore different architectures of energy functions and different training methods to investigate the capabilities of ELMs in rescoring for speech recognition, all using large pretrained models as backbones.

**Title:** Tokenized Graph Transformer with Neighborhood Augmentation for Node  Classification in Large Graphs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12677  
**Abstract:** Graph Transformers, emerging as a new architecture for graph representation learning, suffer from the quadratic complexity on the number of nodes when handling large graphs. To this end, we propose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats each node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our proposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood features from different hops into different representations, producing a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs. Moreover, we mathematically show that compared to a category of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), called decoupled Graph Convolutional Networks, NAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from multi-hop neighborhoods. In addition, we propose a new data augmentation method called Neighborhood Augmentation (NrAug) based on the output of Hop2Token that augments simultaneously the features of neighborhoods from global as well as local views to strengthen the training effect of NAGphormer. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large demonstrate the superiority of NAGphormer against existing graph Transformers and mainstream GNNs, and the effectiveness of NrAug for further boosting NAGphormer.

**Title:** G3Detector: General GPT-Generated Text Detector  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12680  
**Abstract:** The burgeoning progress in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) heralds significant benefits due to their unparalleled capacities. However, it is critical to acknowledge the potential misuse of these models, which could give rise to a spectrum of social and ethical dilemmas. Despite numerous preceding efforts centered around distinguishing synthetic text, most existing detection systems fail to identify data synthesized by the latest LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. In response to this challenge, we introduce an unpretentious yet potent detection approach proficient in identifying synthetic text across a wide array of fields. Moreover, our detector demonstrates outstanding performance uniformly across various model architectures and decoding strategies. It also possesses the capability to identify text generated utilizing a potent detection-evasion technique. Our comprehensive research underlines our commitment to boosting the robustness and efficiency of machine-generated text detection mechanisms, particularly in the context of swiftly progressing and increasingly adaptive AI technologies.

**Title:** Phased data augmentation for training PixelCNNs with VQ-VAE-2 and  limited data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12681  
**Abstract:** With development of deep learning, researchers have developed generative models in generating realistic images. One of such generative models, a PixelCNNs model with Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder 2 (VQ-VAE-2), can generate more various images than other models. However, a PixelCNNs model with VQ-VAE-2, I call it PC-VQ2, requires sufficiently much training data like other deep learning models. Its practical applications are often limited in domains where collecting sufficient data is not difficult. To solve the problem, researchers have recently proposed more data-efficient methods for training generative models with limited unlabeled data from scratch. However, no such methods in PC-VQ2s have been researched. This study provides the first step in this direction, considering generation of images using PC-VQ2s and limited unlabeled data. In this study, I propose a training strategy for training a PC-VQ2 with limited data from scratch, phased data augmentation. In the strategy, ranges of parameters of data augmentation is narrowed in phases through learning. Quantitative evaluation shows that the phased data augmentation enables the model with limited data to generate images competitive with the one with sufficient data in diversity and outperforming it in fidelity. The evaluation suggests that the proposed method should be useful for training a PC-VQ2 with limited data efficiently to generate various and natural images.

**Title:** Mist: Towards Improved Adversarial Examples for Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12683  
**Abstract:** Diffusion Models (DMs) have empowered great success in artificial-intelligence-generated content, especially in artwork creation, yet raising new concerns in intellectual properties and copyright. For example, infringers can make profits by imitating non-authorized human-created paintings with DMs. Recent researches suggest that various adversarial examples for diffusion models can be effective tools against these copyright infringements. However, current adversarial examples show weakness in transferability over different painting-imitating methods and robustness under straightforward adversarial defense, for example, noise purification. We surprisingly find that the transferability of adversarial examples can be significantly enhanced by exploiting a fused and modified adversarial loss term under consistent parameters. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate the cross-method transferability of adversarial examples. The experimental observation shows that our method generates more transferable adversarial examples with even stronger robustness against the simple adversarial defense.

**Title:** FIT: Far-reaching Interleaved Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12689  
**Abstract:** We present FIT: a transformer-based architecture with efficient self-attention and adaptive computation. Unlike original transformers, which operate on a single sequence of data tokens, we divide the data tokens into groups, with each group being a shorter sequence of tokens. We employ two types of transformer layers: local layers operate on data tokens within each group, while global layers operate on a smaller set of introduced latent tokens. These layers, comprising the same set of self-attention and feed-forward layers as standard transformers, are interleaved, and cross-attention is used to facilitate information exchange between data and latent tokens within the same group. The attention complexity is $O(n^2)$ locally within each group of size $n$, but can reach $O(L^{{4}/{3}})$ globally for sequence length of $L$. The efficiency can be further enhanced by relying more on global layers that perform adaptive computation using a smaller set of latent tokens. FIT is a versatile architecture and can function as an encoder, diffusion decoder, or autoregressive decoder. We provide initial evidence demonstrating its effectiveness in high-resolution image understanding and generation tasks. Notably, FIT exhibits potential in performing end-to-end training on gigabit-scale data, such as 6400$\times$6400 images, even without specific optimizations or model parallelism.

**Title:** More Perspectives Mean Better: Underwater Target Recognition and  Localization with Multimodal Data via Symbiotic Transformer and Multiview  Regression  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12701  
**Abstract:** Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) and localization (UATL) play important roles in marine exploration. The highly noisy acoustic signal and time-frequency interference among various sources pose big challenges to this task. To tackle these issues, we propose a multimodal approach to extract and fuse audio-visual-textual information to recognize and localize underwater targets through the designed Symbiotic Transformer (Symb-Trans) and Multi-View Regression (MVR) method. The multimodal data were first preprocessed by a custom-designed HetNorm module to normalize the multi-source data in a common feature space. The Symb-Trans module embeds audiovisual features by co-training the preprocessed multimodal features through parallel branches and a content encoder with cross-attention. The audiovisual features are then used for underwater target recognition. Meanwhile, the text embedding combined with the audiovisual features is fed to an MVR module to predict the localization of the underwater targets through multi-view clustering and multiple regression. Since no off-the-shell multimodal dataset is available for UATR and UATL, we combined multiple public datasets, consisting of acoustic, and/or visual, and/or textural data, to obtain audio-visual-textual triplets for model training and validation. Experiments show that our model outperforms comparative methods in 91.7% (11 out of 12 metrics) and 100% (4 metrics) of the quantitative metrics for the recognition and localization tasks, respectively. In a case study, we demonstrate the advantages of multi-view models in establishing sample discriminability through visualization methods. For UATL, the proposed MVR method produces the relation graphs, which allow predictions based on records of underwater targets with similar conditions.

**Title:** The CLIP Model is Secretly an Image-to-Prompt Converter  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12716  
**Abstract:** The Stable Diffusion model is a prominent text-to-image generation model that relies on a text prompt as its input, which is encoded using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). However, text prompts have limitations when it comes to incorporating implicit information from reference images. Existing methods have attempted to address this limitation by employing expensive training procedures involving millions of training samples for image-to-image generation. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that the CLIP model, as utilized in Stable Diffusion, inherently possesses the ability to instantaneously convert images into text prompts. Such an image-to-prompt conversion can be achieved by utilizing a linear projection matrix that is calculated in a closed form. Moreover, the paper showcases that this capability can be further enhanced by either utilizing a small amount of similar-domain training data (approximately 100 images) or incorporating several online training steps (around 30 iterations) on the reference images. By leveraging these approaches, the proposed method offers a simple and flexible solution to bridge the gap between images and text prompts. This methodology can be applied to various tasks such as image variation and image editing, facilitating more effective and seamless interaction between images and textual prompts.

**Title:** TADA: Efficient Task-Agnostic Domain Adaptation for Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12717  
**Abstract:** Intermediate training of pre-trained transformer-based language models on domain-specific data leads to substantial gains for downstream tasks. To increase efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting alleviated from full domain-adaptive pre-training, approaches such as adapters have been developed. However, these require additional parameters for each layer, and are criticized for their limited expressiveness. In this work, we introduce TADA, a novel task-agnostic domain adaptation method which is modular, parameter-efficient, and thus, data-efficient. Within TADA, we retrain the embeddings to learn domain-aware input representations and tokenizers for the transformer encoder, while freezing all other parameters of the model. Then, task-specific fine-tuning is performed. We further conduct experiments with meta-embeddings and newly introduced meta-tokenizers, resulting in one model per task in multi-domain use cases. Our broad evaluation in 4 downstream tasks for 14 domains across single- and multi-domain setups and high- and low-resource scenarios reveals that TADA is an effective and efficient alternative to full domain-adaptive pre-training and adapters for domain adaptation, while not introducing additional parameters or complex training steps.

**Title:** Towards Explainable In-the-Wild Video Quality Assessment: a Database and  a Language-Prompted Approach  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12726  
**Abstract:** The proliferation of in-the-wild videos has greatly expanded the Video Quality Assessment (VQA) problem. Unlike early definitions that usually focus on limited distortion types, VQA on in-the-wild videos is especially challenging as it could be affected by complicated factors, including various distortions and diverse contents. Though subjective studies have collected overall quality scores for these videos, how the abstract quality scores relate with specific factors is still obscure, hindering VQA methods from more concrete quality evaluations (e.g. sharpness of a video). To solve this problem, we collect over two million opinions on 4,543 in-the-wild videos on 13 dimensions of quality-related factors, including in-capture authentic distortions (e.g. motion blur, noise, flicker), errors introduced by compression and transmission, and higher-level experiences on semantic contents and aesthetic issues (e.g. composition, camera trajectory), to establish the multi-dimensional Maxwell database. Specifically, we ask the subjects to label among a positive, a negative, and a neural choice for each dimension. These explanation-level opinions allow us to measure the relationships between specific quality factors and abstract subjective quality ratings, and to benchmark different categories of VQA algorithms on each dimension, so as to more comprehensively analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we propose the MaxVQA, a language-prompted VQA approach that modifies vision-language foundation model CLIP to better capture important quality issues as observed in our analyses. The MaxVQA can jointly evaluate various specific quality factors and final quality scores with state-of-the-art accuracy on all dimensions, and superb generalization ability on existing datasets.

**Title:** Can We Edit Factual Knowledge by In-Context Learning?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12740  
**Abstract:** Previous studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) like GPTs store massive factual knowledge in their parameters. However, the stored knowledge could be false or out-dated. Traditional knowledge editing methods refine LLMs via fine-tuning on texts containing specific knowledge. However, with the increasing scales of LLMs, these gradient-based approaches bring large computation costs. The trend of model-as-a-service also makes it impossible to modify knowledge in black-box LMs. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), a new paradigm based on demonstration contexts without parameter updating, we explore whether ICL can edit factual knowledge. To answer this question, we give a comprehensive empirical study of ICL strategies. Experiments show that in-context knowledge editing (IKE), without any gradient and parameter updating, achieves a competitive success rate compared to gradient-based methods on GPT-J (6B) but with much fewer side effects, including less over-editing on similar but unrelated facts and less knowledge forgetting on previously stored knowledge. We also apply the method to larger LMs with tens or hundreds of parameters like OPT-175B, which shows the scalability of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/Zce1112zslx/IKE.

**Abstract:** In this paper,an Enhanced Self-Attention (ESA) mechanism has been put forward for robust feature extraction.The proposed ESA is integrated with the recursive gated convolution and self-attention mechanism.In particular, the former is used to capture multi-order feature interaction and the latter is for global feature extraction.In addition, the location of interest that is suitable for inserting the ESA is also worth being explored.In this paper, the ESA is embedded into the encoder layer of the Transformer network for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, and this newly proposed model is named GNCformer. The effectiveness of the GNCformer has been validated using two datasets, that are Aishell-1 and HKUST.Experimental results show that, compared with the Transformer network,0.8%CER,and 1.2%CER improvement for these two mentioned datasets, respectively, can be achieved.It is worth mentioning that only 1.4M additional parameters have been involved in our proposed GNCformer.

In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in order to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing one hypothesis that LLMs can simulate kernel regression algorithms when faced with in-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on in-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat y = \frac{\sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)}{\sum_i K(x, x_i)}$ as the number of in-context demonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors of language models. We find that during ICL, the attentions and hidden features in LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory provides insights on multiple phenomena observed in ICL field: why retrieving demonstrative samples similar to test sample can help, why ICL performance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits from selecting in-distribution and representative samples. We will make our code available to the research community following publication.

**Title:** Towards Robust Personalized Dialogue Generation via Order-Insensitive  Representation Regularization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12782  
**Abstract:** Generating persona consistent dialogue response is important for developing an intelligent conversational agent. Recent works typically fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models on this task by concatenating persona texts and dialogue history as a single input sequence to generate the target response. While simple and effective, our analysis shows that this popular practice is seriously affected by order sensitivity where different input orders of persona sentences significantly impact the quality and consistency of generated response, resulting in severe performance fluctuations (i.e., 29.4% on GPT2 and 83.2% on BART). To mitigate the order sensitivity problem, we propose a model-agnostic framework, ORder Insensitive Generation (ORIG), which enables dialogue models to learn robust representation under different persona orders and improve the consistency of response generation. Experiments on the Persona-Chat dataset justify the effectiveness and superiority of our method with two dominant pre-trained models (GPT2 and BART).

**Title:** MacLaSa: Multi-Aspect Controllable Text Generation via Efficient  Sampling from Compact Latent Space  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12785  
**Abstract:** Multi-aspect controllable text generation aims to generate fluent sentences that possess multiple desired attributes simultaneously. Traditional methods either combine many operators in the decoding stage, often with costly iteration or search in the discrete text space, or train separate controllers for each aspect, resulting in a degeneration of text quality due to the discrepancy between different aspects. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach for multi-aspect control, namely MacLaSa, that estimates compact latent space for multiple aspects and performs efficient sampling with a robust sampler based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To eliminate the domain gaps between different aspects, we utilize a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) network to map text sequences from varying data sources into close latent representations. The estimated latent space enables the formulation of joint energy-based models (EBMs) and the plugging in of arbitrary attribute discriminators to achieve multi-aspect control. Afterwards, we draw latent vector samples with an ODE-based sampler and feed sampled examples to the VAE decoder to produce target text sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that MacLaSa outperforms several strong baselines on attribute relevance and textual quality while maintaining a high inference speed.

**Title:** Spatiotemporal Attention-based Semantic Compression for Real-time Video  Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12796  
**Abstract:** This paper studies the computational offloading of video action recognition in edge computing. To achieve effective semantic information extraction and compression, following semantic communication we propose a novel spatiotemporal attention-based autoencoder (STAE) architecture, including a frame attention module and a spatial attention module, to evaluate the importance of frames and pixels in each frame. Additionally, we use entropy encoding to remove statistical redundancy in the compressed data to further reduce communication overhead. At the receiver, we develop a lightweight decoder that leverages a 3D-2D CNN combined architecture to reconstruct missing information by simultaneously learning temporal and spatial information from the received data to improve accuracy. To fasten convergence, we use a step-by-step approach to train the resulting STAE-based vision transformer (ViT_STAE) models. Experimental results show that ViT_STAE can compress the video dataset HMDB51 by 104x with only 5% accuracy loss, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline DeepISC. The proposed ViT_STAE achieves faster inference and higher accuracy than the DeepISC-based ViT model under time-varying wireless channel, which highlights the effectiveness of STAE in guaranteeing higher accuracy under time constraints.

**Title:** Towards Dialogue Systems with Agency in Human-AI Collaboration Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12815  
**Abstract:** Agency, the capacity to proactively shape events, is crucial to how humans interact and collaborate with other humans. In this paper, we investigate Agency as a potentially desirable function of dialogue agents, and how it can be measured and controlled. We build upon the social-cognitive theory of Bandura (2001) to develop a framework of features through which Agency is expressed in dialogue -- indicating what you intend to do (Intentionality), motivating your intentions (Motivation), having self-belief in intentions (Self-Efficacy), and being able to self-adjust (Self-Regulation). We collect and release a new dataset of 83 human-human collaborative interior design conversations containing 908 conversational snippets annotated for Agency features. Using this dataset, we explore methods for measuring and controlling Agency in dialogue systems. Automatic and human evaluation show that although a baseline GPT-3 model can express Intentionality, models that explicitly manifest features associated with high Motivation, Self-Efficacy, and Self-Regulation are better perceived as being highly agentive. This work has implications for the development of dialogue systems with varying degrees of Agency in collaborative tasks.

**Title:** Registering Neural Radiance Fields as 3D Density Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12843  
**Abstract:** No significant work has been done to directly merge two partially overlapping scenes using NeRF representations. Given pre-trained NeRF models of a 3D scene with partial overlapping, this paper aligns them with a rigid transform, by generalizing the traditional registration pipeline, that is, key point detection and point set registration, to operate on 3D density fields. To describe corner points as key points in 3D, we propose to use universal pre-trained descriptor-generating neural networks that can be trained and tested on different scenes. We perform experiments to demonstrate that the descriptor networks can be conveniently trained using a contrastive learning strategy. We demonstrate that our method, as a global approach, can effectively register NeRF models, thus making possible future large-scale NeRF construction by registering its smaller and overlapping NeRFs captured individually.

**Title:** Automatic Code Summarization via ChatGPT: How Far Are We?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12865  
**Abstract:** To support software developers in understanding and maintaining programs, various automatic code summarization techniques have been proposed to generate a concise natural language comment for a given code snippet. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of natural language processing tasks. Among them, ChatGPT is the most popular one which has attracted wide attention from the software engineering community. However, it still remains unclear how ChatGPT performs in (automatic) code summarization. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on evaluating ChatGPT on a widely-used Python dataset called CSN-Python and comparing it with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) code summarization models. Specifically, we first explore an appropriate prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate in-distribution comments. Then, we use such a prompt to ask ChatGPT to generate comments for all code snippets in the CSN-Python test set. We adopt three widely-used metrics (including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L) to measure the quality of the comments generated by ChatGPT and SOTA models (including NCS, CodeBERT, and CodeT5). The experimental results show that in terms of BLEU and ROUGE-L, ChatGPT's code summarization performance is significantly worse than all three SOTA models. We also present some cases and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT in code summarization. Based on the findings, we outline several open challenges and opportunities in ChatGPT-based code summarization.

**Title:** Lion: Adversarial Distillation of Closed-Source Large Language Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12870  
**Abstract:** The practice of transferring knowledge from a sophisticated, closed-source large language model (LLM) to a compact, open-source LLM has garnered considerable attention. Previous works have focused on a unidirectional knowledge distillation way by aligning the responses of the student model with those of the teacher model to a set of instructions. Nevertheless, they overlooked the possibility of incorporating any reciprocal "feedback"--identifying challenging instructions where the student model's performance falls short--to boost the student model's proficiency iteratively. To this end, we propose a novel adversarial distillation framework for a more efficient knowledge transfer. Leveraging the versatile role adaptability of LLMs, we prompt the closed-source model to identify "hard" instructions and generate new "hard" instructions for the student model, creating a three-stage adversarial loop of imitation, discrimination, and generation. By applying this adversarial framework, we successfully transfer knowledge from ChatGPT to a 7B student model (named Lion), achieving nearly 95% capability approximation using a mere 70k training data. We aspire that this proposed model may serve as the baseline to reflect the performance of ChatGPT, especially the open-source instruction-following language model baseline for our community.

**Title:** Evaluating Prompt-based Question Answering for Object Prediction in the  Open Research Knowledge Graph  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12900  
**Abstract:** There have been many recent investigations into prompt-based training of transformer language models for new text genres in low-resource settings. The prompt-based training approach has been found to be effective in generalizing pre-trained or fine-tuned models for transfer to resource-scarce settings. This work, for the first time, reports results on adopting prompt-based training of transformers for \textit{scholarly knowledge graph object prediction}. The work is unique in the following two main aspects. 1) It deviates from the other works proposing entity and relation extraction pipelines for predicting objects of a scholarly knowledge graph. 2) While other works have tested the method on text genera relatively close to the general knowledge domain, we test the method for a significantly different domain, i.e. scholarly knowledge, in turn testing the linguistic, probabilistic, and factual generalizability of these large-scale transformer models. We find that (i) per expectations, transformer models when tested out-of-the-box underperform on a new domain of data, (ii) prompt-based training of the models achieve performance boosts of up to 40\% in a relaxed evaluation setting, and (iii) testing the models on a starkly different domain even with a clever training objective in a low resource setting makes evident the domain knowledge capture gap offering an empirically-verified incentive for investing more attention and resources to the scholarly domain in the context of transformer models.

**Title:** DiffAVA: Personalized Text-to-Audio Generation with Visual Alignment  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12903  
**Abstract:** Text-to-audio (TTA) generation is a recent popular problem that aims to synthesize general audio given text descriptions. Previous methods utilized latent diffusion models to learn audio embedding in a latent space with text embedding as the condition. However, they ignored the synchronization between audio and visual content in the video, and tended to generate audio mismatching from video frames. In this work, we propose a novel and personalized text-to-sound generation approach with visual alignment based on latent diffusion models, namely DiffAVA, that can simply fine-tune lightweight visual-text alignment modules with frozen modality-specific encoders to update visual-aligned text embeddings as the condition. Specifically, our DiffAVA leverages a multi-head attention transformer to aggregate temporal information from video features, and a dual multi-modal residual network to fuse temporal visual representations with text embeddings. Then, a contrastive learning objective is applied to match visual-aligned text embeddings with audio features. Experimental results on the AudioCaps dataset demonstrate that the proposed DiffAVA can achieve competitive performance on visual-aligned text-to-audio generation.

**Title:** Latent Magic: An Investigation into Adversarial Examples Crafted in the  Semantic Latent Space  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12906  
**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks against Deep Neural Networks(DNN) have been a crutial topic ever since \cite{goodfellow} purposed the vulnerability of DNNs. However, most prior works craft adversarial examples in the pixel space, following the $l_p$ norm constraint. In this paper, we give intuitional explain about why crafting adversarial examples in the latent space is equally efficient and important. We purpose a framework for crafting adversarial examples in semantic latent space based on an pre-trained Variational Auto Encoder from state-of-art Stable Diffusion Model\cite{SDM}. We also show that adversarial examples crafted in the latent space can also achieve a high level of fool rate. However, examples crafted from latent space are often hard to evaluated, as they doesn't follow a certain $l_p$ norm constraint, which is a big challenge for existing researches. To efficiently and accurately evaluate the adversarial examples crafted in the latent space, we purpose \textbf{a novel evaluation matric} based on SSIM\cite{SSIM} loss and fool rate.Additionally, we explain why FID\cite{FID} is not suitable for measuring such adversarial examples. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first evaluation metrics that is specifically designed to evaluate the quality of a adversarial attack. We also investigate the transferability of adversarial examples crafted in the latent space and show that they have superiority over adversarial examples crafted in the pixel space.

**Title:** ExplainCPE: A Free-text Explanation Benchmark of Chinese Pharmacist  Examination  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12945  
**Abstract:** As ChatGPT and GPT-4 spearhead the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more researchers are investigating their performance across various tasks. But more research needs to be done on the interpretability capabilities of LLMs, that is, the ability to generate reasons after an answer has been given. Existing explanation datasets are mostly English-language general knowledge questions, which leads to insufficient thematic and linguistic diversity. To address the language bias and lack of medical resources in generating rationales QA datasets, we present ExplainCPE (over 7k instances), a challenging medical benchmark in Simplified Chinese. We analyzed the errors of ChatGPT and GPT-4, pointing out the limitations of current LLMs in understanding text and computational reasoning. During the experiment, we also found that different LLMs have different preferences for in-context learning. ExplainCPE presents a significant challenge, but its potential for further investigation is promising, and it can be used to evaluate the ability of a model to generate explanations. AI safety and trustworthiness need more attention, and this work makes the first step to explore the medical interpretability of LLMs.The dataset is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ExplainCPE.

**Title:** ChatGPT to Replace Crowdsourcing of Paraphrases for Intent  Classification: Higher Diversity and Comparable Model Robustness  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12947  
**Abstract:** The emergence of generative large language models (LLMs) raises the question: what will be its impact on crowdsourcing. Traditionally, crowdsourcing has been used for acquiring solutions to a wide variety of human-intelligence tasks, including ones involving text generation, manipulation or evaluation. For some of these tasks, models like ChatGPT can potentially substitute human workers. In this study, we investigate, whether this is the case for the task of paraphrase generation for intent classification. We quasi-replicated the data collection methodology of an existing crowdsourcing study (similar scale, prompts and seed data) using ChatGPT. We show that ChatGPT-created paraphrases are more diverse and lead to more robust models.

**Title:** Enhancing Next Active Object-based Egocentric Action Anticipation with  Guided Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12953  
**Abstract:** Short-term action anticipation (STA) in first-person videos is a challenging task that involves understanding the next active object interactions and predicting future actions. Existing action anticipation methods have primarily focused on utilizing features extracted from video clips, but often overlooked the importance of objects and their interactions. To this end, we propose a novel approach that applies a guided attention mechanism between the objects, and the spatiotemporal features extracted from video clips, enhancing the motion and contextual information, and further decoding the object-centric and motion-centric information to address the problem of STA in egocentric videos. Our method, GANO (Guided Attention for Next active Objects) is a multi-modal, end-to-end, single transformer-based network. The experimental results performed on the largest egocentric dataset demonstrate that GANO outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for the prediction of the next active object label, its bounding box location, the corresponding future action, and the time to contact the object. The ablation study shows the positive contribution of the guided attention mechanism compared to other fusion methods. Moreover, it is possible to improve the next active object location and class label prediction results of GANO by just appending the learnable object tokens with the region of interest embeddings.

**Title:** Is Synthetic Data From Diffusion Models Ready for Knowledge  Distillation?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12954  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models have recently achieved astonishing performance in generating high-fidelity photo-realistic images. Given their huge success, it is still unclear whether synthetic images are applicable for knowledge distillation when real images are unavailable. In this paper, we extensively study whether and how synthetic images produced from state-of-the-art diffusion models can be used for knowledge distillation without access to real images, and obtain three key conclusions: (1) synthetic data from diffusion models can easily lead to state-of-the-art performance among existing synthesis-based distillation methods, (2) low-fidelity synthetic images are better teaching materials, and (3) relatively weak classifiers are better teachers.

**Title:** Gated Stereo: Joint Depth Estimation from Gated and Wide-Baseline Active  Stereo Cues  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12955  
**Abstract:** We propose Gated Stereo, a high-resolution and long-range depth estimation technique that operates on active gated stereo images. Using active and high dynamic range passive captures, Gated Stereo exploits multi-view cues alongside time-of-flight intensity cues from active gating. To this end, we propose a depth estimation method with a monocular and stereo depth prediction branch which are combined in a final fusion stage. Each block is supervised through a combination of supervised and gated self-supervision losses. To facilitate training and validation, we acquire a long-range synchronized gated stereo dataset for automotive scenarios. We find that the method achieves an improvement of more than 50 % MAE compared to the next best RGB stereo method, and 74 % MAE to existing monocular gated methods for distances up to 160 m. Our code,models and datasets are available here.

**Title:** Distilling ChatGPT for Explainable Automated Student Answer Assessment  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12962  
**Abstract:** Assessing student answers and providing valuable feedback is crucial for effective learning, but it can be a time-consuming task. Traditional methods of automating student answer assessment through text classification often suffer from issues such as lack of trustworthiness, transparency, and the ability to provide a rationale for the automated assessment process. These limitations hinder their usefulness in practice. In this paper, we explore using ChatGPT, a cutting-edge large language model, for the concurrent tasks of student answer scoring and rationale generation under both the zero-shot and few-shot settings. We introduce a critic module which automatically filters incorrect outputs from ChatGPT and utilizes the remaining ChtaGPT outputs as noisy labelled data to fine-tune a smaller language model, enabling it to perform student answer scoring and rationale generation. Moreover, by drawing multiple samples from ChatGPT outputs, we are able to compute predictive confidence scores, which in turn can be used to identify corrupted data and human label errors in the training set. Our experimental results demonstrate that despite being a few orders of magnitude smaller than ChatGPT, the fine-tuned language model achieves better performance in student answer scoring. Furthermore, it generates more detailed and comprehensible assessments than traditional text classification methods. Our approach provides a viable solution to achieve explainable automated assessment in education.

**Title:** Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12966  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code and trained models are available at https://github.com/zhengchen1999/HI-Diff.

**Title:** VanillaNet: the Power of Minimalism in Deep Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12972  
**Abstract:** At the heart of foundation models is the philosophy of "more is different", exemplified by the astonishing success in computer vision and natural language processing. However, the challenges of optimization and inherent complexity of transformer models call for a paradigm shift towards simplicity. In this study, we introduce VanillaNet, a neural network architecture that embraces elegance in design. By avoiding high depth, shortcuts, and intricate operations like self-attention, VanillaNet is refreshingly concise yet remarkably powerful. Each layer is carefully crafted to be compact and straightforward, with nonlinear activation functions pruned after training to restore the original architecture. VanillaNet overcomes the challenges of inherent complexity, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. Its easy-to-understand and highly simplified architecture opens new possibilities for efficient deployment. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that VanillaNet delivers performance on par with renowned deep neural networks and vision transformers, showcasing the power of minimalism in deep learning. This visionary journey of VanillaNet has significant potential to redefine the landscape and challenge the status quo of foundation model, setting a new path for elegant and effective model design.

**Title:** Why current rain denoising models fail on CycleGAN created rain images  in autonomous driving  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12983  
**Abstract:** One of the main tasks of an autonomous agent in a vehicle is to correctly perceive its environment. Much of the data that needs to be processed is collected by optical sensors such as cameras. Unfortunately, the data collected in this way can be affected by a variety of factors, including environmental influences such as inclement weather conditions (e.g., rain). Such noisy data can cause autonomous agents to take wrong decisions with potentially fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the rain image challenge by two steps: First, rain is artificially added to a set of clear-weather condition images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This yields good/bad weather image pairs for training de-raining models. This artificial generation of rain images is sufficiently realistic as in 7 out of 10 cases, human test subjects believed the generated rain images to be real. In a second step, this paired good/bad weather image data is used to train two rain denoising models, one based primarily on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the other using a Vision Transformer. This rain de-noising step showed limited performance as the quality gain was only about 15%. This lack of performance on realistic rain images as used in our study is likely due to current rain de-noising models being developed for simplistic rain overlay data. Our study shows that there is ample space for improvement of de-raining models in autonomous driving.

**Title:** Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo method for approximations of SDEs with  non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12992  
**Abstract:** In the field of computational finance, it is common for the quantity of interest to be expected values of functions of random variables via stochastic differential equations (SDEs). For SDEs with globally Lipschitz coefficients and commutative diffusion coefficients, the explicit Milstein scheme, relying on only Brownian increments and thus easily implementable, can be combined with the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method proposed by Giles \cite{giles2008multilevel} to give the optimal overall computational cost $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the required target accuracy. For multi-dimensional SDEs that do not satisfy the commutativity condition, a kind of one-half order truncated Milstein-type scheme without L\'evy areas is introduced by Giles and Szpruch \cite{giles2014antithetic}, which combined with the antithetic MLMC gives the optimal computational cost under globally Lipschitz conditions. In the present work, we turn to SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, for which a family of modified Milstein-type schemes without L\'evy areas is proposed. The expected one-half order of strong convergence is recovered in a non-globally Lipschitz setting, where the diffusion coefficients are allowed to grow superlinearly. This helps us to analyze the relevant variance of the multilevel estimator and the optimal computational cost is finally achieved for the antithetic MLMC. The analysis of both the convergence rate and the desired variance in the non-globally Lipschitz setting is highly non-trivial and non-standard arguments are developed to overcome some essential difficulties. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.

**Title:** Bidirectional Transformer Reranker for Grammatical Error Correction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13000  
**Abstract:** Pre-trained seq2seq models have achieved state-of-the-art results in the grammatical error correction task. However, these models still suffer from a prediction bias due to their unidirectional decoding. Thus, we propose a bidirectional Transformer reranker (BTR), that re-estimates the probability of each candidate sentence generated by the pre-trained seq2seq model. The BTR preserves the seq2seq-style Transformer architecture but utilizes a BERT-style self-attention mechanism in the decoder to compute the probability of each target token by using masked language modeling to capture bidirectional representations from the target context. For guiding the reranking, the BTR adopts negative sampling in the objective function to minimize the unlikelihood. During inference, the BTR gives final results after comparing the reranked top-1 results with the original ones by an acceptance threshold. Experimental results show that, in reranking candidates from a pre-trained seq2seq model, T5-base, the BTR on top of T5-base could yield 65.47 and 71.27 F0.5 scores on the CoNLL-14 and BEA test sets, respectively, and yield 59.52 GLEU score on the JFLEG corpus, with improvements of 0.36, 0.76 and 0.48 points compared with the original T5-base. Furthermore, when reranking candidates from T5-large, the BTR on top of T5-base improved the original T5-large by 0.26 points on the BEA test set.

**Title:** Can Large Language Models emulate an inductive Thematic Analysis of  semi-structured interviews? An exploration and provocation on the limits of  the approach and the model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13014  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful generative Artificial Intelligence solutions which can be applied to several fields and areas of work. This paper presents results and reflection of an experiment done to use the model GPT 3.5-Turbo to emulate some aspects of an inductive Thematic Analysis. Previous research on this subject has largely worked on conducting deductive analysis. Thematic Analysis is a qualitative method for analysis commonly used in social sciences and it is based on interpretations made by the human analyst(s) and the identification of explicit and latent meanings in qualitative data. Attempting an analysis based on human interpretation with an LLM clearly is a provocation but also a way to learn something about how these systems can or cannot be used in qualitative research. The paper presents the motivations for attempting this emulation, it reflects on how the six steps to a Thematic Analysis proposed by Braun and Clarke can at least partially be reproduced with the LLM and it also reflects on what are the outputs produced by the model. The paper used two existing datasets of open access semi-structured interviews, previously analysed with Thematic Analysis by other researchers. It used the previously produced analysis (and the related themes) to compare with the results produced by the LLM. The results show that the model can infer at least partially some of the main Themes. The objective of the paper is not to replace human analysts in qualitative analysis but to learn if some elements of LLM data manipulation can to an extent be of support for qualitative research.

**Title:** Iterative Forward Tuning Boosts In-context Learning in Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13016  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited an emergent in-context learning (ICL) ability. However, the ICL models that can solve ordinary cases are hardly extended to solve more complex tasks by processing the demonstration examples once. This single-turn ICL is incoordinate with the decision making process of humans by learning from analogy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs by exploiting a dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent-based optimization. Concretely, we divide the ICL process into "Deep-Thinking" and inference stages. The "Deep-Thinking" stage performs iterative forward optimization of demonstrations, which is expected to boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs at test time by "thinking" demonstrations multiple times. It produces accumulated meta-gradients by manipulating the Key-Value matrices in the self-attention modules of the Transformer. Then, the inference stage only takes the test query as input without concatenating demonstrations and applies the learned meta-gradients through attention for output prediction. In this way, demonstrations are not required during the inference stage since they are already learned and stored in the definitive meta-gradients. LLMs can be effectively and efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten classification and multiple-choice datasets show that our method achieves substantially better performance than standard ICL in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

**Title:** HGFormer: Hierarchical Grouping Transformer for Domain Generalized  Semantic Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13031  
**Abstract:** Current semantic segmentation models have achieved great success under the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) condition. However, in real-world applications, test data might come from a different domain than training data. Therefore, it is important to improve model robustness against domain differences. This work studies semantic segmentation under the domain generalization setting, where a model is trained only on the source domain and tested on the unseen target domain. Existing works show that Vision Transformers are more robust than CNNs and show that this is related to the visual grouping property of self-attention. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical grouping transformer (HGFormer) to explicitly group pixels to form part-level masks and then whole-level masks. The masks at different scales aim to segment out both parts and a whole of classes. HGFormer combines mask classification results at both scales for class label prediction. We assemble multiple interesting cross-domain settings by using seven public semantic segmentation datasets. Experiments show that HGFormer yields more robust semantic segmentation results than per-pixel classification methods and flat grouping transformers, and outperforms previous methods significantly. Code will be available at https://github.com/dingjiansw101/HGFormer.

**Title:** Getting ViT in Shape: Scaling Laws for Compute-Optimal Model Design  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13035  
**Abstract:** Scaling laws have been recently employed to derive compute-optimal model size (number of parameters) for a given compute duration. We advance and refine such methods to infer compute-optimal model shapes, such as width and depth, and successfully implement this in vision transformers. Our shape-optimized vision transformer, SoViT, achieves results competitive with models that exceed twice its size, despite being pre-trained with an equivalent amount of compute. For example, SoViT-400m/14 achieves 90.3% fine-tuning accuracy on ILSRCV2012, surpassing the much larger ViT-g/14 and approaching ViT-G/14 under identical settings, with also less than half the inference cost. We conduct a thorough evaluation across multiple tasks, such as image classification, captioning, VQA and zero-shot transfer, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model across a broad range of domains and identifying limitations. Overall, our findings challenge the prevailing approach of blindly scaling up vision models and pave a path for a more informed scaling.

**Title:** SpokenWOZ: A Large-Scale Speech-Text Benchmark for Spoken Task-Oriented  Dialogue in Multiple Domains  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13040  
**Abstract:** Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models have great progress in the past few years. However, these studies primarily focus on datasets written by annotators, which has resulted in a gap between academic research and more realistic spoken conversation scenarios. While a few small-scale spoken TOD datasets are proposed to address robustness issues, e.g., ASR errors, they fail to identify the unique challenges in spoken conversation. To tackle the limitations, we introduce SpokenWOZ, a large-scale speech-text dataset for spoken TOD, which consists of 8 domains, 203k turns, 5.7k dialogues and 249 hours of audios from human-to-human spoken conversations. SpokenWOZ incorporates common spoken characteristics such as word-by-word processing and commonsense reasoning. We also present cross-turn slot and reasoning slot detection as new challenges based on the spoken linguistic phenomena. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various models, including text-modal baselines, newly proposed dual-modal baselines and LLMs. The results show the current models still has substantial areas for improvement in spoken conversation, including fine-tuned models and LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT.

**Title:** Automated stance detection in complex topics and small languages: the  challenging case of immigration in polarizing news media  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13047  
**Abstract:** Automated stance detection and related machine learning methods can provide useful insights for media monitoring and academic research. Many of these approaches require annotated training datasets, which limits their applicability for languages where these may not be readily available. This paper explores the applicability of large language models for automated stance detection in a challenging scenario, involving a morphologically complex, lower-resource language, and a socio-culturally complex topic, immigration. If the approach works in this case, it can be expected to perform as well or better in less demanding scenarios. We annotate a large set of pro and anti-immigration examples, and compare the performance of multiple language models as supervised learners. We also probe the usability of ChatGPT as an instructable zero-shot classifier for the same task. Supervised achieves acceptable performance, and ChatGPT yields similar accuracy. This is promising as a potentially simpler and cheaper alternative for text classification tasks, including in lower-resource languages. We further use the best-performing model to investigate diachronic trends over seven years in two corpora of Estonian mainstream and right-wing populist news sources, demonstrating the applicability of the approach for news analytics and media monitoring settings, and discuss correspondences between stance changes and real-world events.

**Title:** RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13048  
**Abstract:** Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, which parallelizes computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference, leading to the first non-transformer architecture to be scaled to tens of billions of parameters. Our experiments reveal that RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting that future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.

**Title:** AudioToken: Adaptation of Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models for  Audio-to-Image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13050  
**Abstract:** In recent years, image generation has shown a great leap in performance, where diffusion models play a central role. Although generating high-quality images, such models are mainly conditioned on textual descriptions. This begs the question: "how can we adopt such models to be conditioned on other modalities?". In this paper, we propose a novel method utilizing latent diffusion models trained for text-to-image-generation to generate images conditioned on audio recordings. Using a pre-trained audio encoding model, the proposed method encodes audio into a new token, which can be considered as an adaptation layer between the audio and text representations. Such a modeling paradigm requires a small number of trainable parameters, making the proposed approach appealing for lightweight optimization. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baseline methods, considering objective and subjective metrics. Code and samples are available at: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/AudioToken.

**Title:** Learning Pedestrian Actions to Ensure Safe Autonomous Driving  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13051  
**Abstract:** To ensure safe autonomous driving in urban environments with complex vehicle-pedestrian interactions, it is critical for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to have the ability to predict pedestrians' short-term and immediate actions in real-time. In recent years, various methods have been developed to study estimating pedestrian behaviors for autonomous driving scenarios, but there is a lack of clear definitions for pedestrian behaviors. In this work, the literature gaps are investigated and a taxonomy is presented for pedestrian behavior characterization. Further, a novel multi-task sequence to sequence Transformer encoders-decoders (TF-ed) architecture is proposed for pedestrian action and trajectory prediction using only ego vehicle camera observations as inputs. The proposed approach is compared against an existing LSTM encoders decoders (LSTM-ed) architecture for action and trajectory prediction. The performance of both models is evaluated on the publicly available Joint Attention Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, CARLA simulation data as well as real-time self-driving shuttle data collected on university campus. Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed method reaches an accuracy of 81% on action prediction task on JAAD testing data and outperforms the LSTM-ed by 7.4%, while LSTM counterpart performs much better on trajectory prediction task for a prediction sequence length of 25 frames.

**Title:** Retrieval-augmented Multi-label Text Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13058  
**Abstract:** Multi-label text classification (MLC) is a challenging task in settings of large label sets, where label support follows a Zipfian distribution. In this paper, we address this problem through retrieval augmentation, aiming to improve the sample efficiency of classification models. Our approach closely follows the standard MLC architecture of a Transformer-based encoder paired with a set of classification heads. In our case, however, the input document representation is augmented through cross-attention to similar documents retrieved from the training set and represented in a task-specific manner. We evaluate this approach on four datasets from the legal and biomedical domains, all of which feature highly skewed label distributions. Our experiments show that retrieval augmentation substantially improves model performance on the long tail of infrequent labels especially so for lower-resource training scenarios and more challenging long-document data scenarios.

**Title:** Evaluating and Enhancing Structural Understanding Capabilities of Large  Language Models on Tables via Input Designs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13062  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are becoming attractive as few-shot reasoners to solve NL-related tasks. However, there is still much to be learned about how well LLMs understand structured data, such as tables. While it is true that tables can be used as inputs to LLMs with serialization, there lack comprehensive studies examining whether LLMs can truly comprehend such data. In this paper we try to understand this by designing a benchmark to evaluate structural understanding capabilities (SUC) of LLMs. The benchmark we create includes seven tasks, each with their own unique challenges, e.g,, cell lookup, row retrieval and size detection. We run a series of evaluations on GPT-3 family models (e.g., text-davinci-003). We discover that the performance varied depending on a number of input choices, including table input format, content order, role prompting and partition marks. Drawing from the insights gained through the benchmark evaluations, we then propose self-augmentation for effective structural prompting, e.g., critical value / range identification using LLMs' internal knowledge. When combined with carefully chosen input choices, these structural prompting methods lead to promising improvements in LLM performance on a variety of tabular tasks, e.g., TabFact($\uparrow2.31\%$), HybridQA($\uparrow2.13\%$), SQA($\uparrow2.72\%$), Feverous($\uparrow0.84\%$), and ToTTo($\uparrow5.68\%$). We believe our benchmark and proposed prompting methods can serve as a simple yet generic selection for future research. The code and data are released in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/StructuredLLM-76F3.

**Title:** ControlVideo: Training-free Controllable Text-to-Video Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13077  
**Abstract:** Text-driven diffusion models have unlocked unprecedented abilities in image generation, whereas their video counterpart still lags behind due to the excessive training cost of temporal modeling. Besides the training burden, the generated videos also suffer from appearance inconsistency and structural flickers, especially in long video synthesis. To address these challenges, we design a \emph{training-free} framework called \textbf{ControlVideo} to enable natural and efficient text-to-video generation. ControlVideo, adapted from ControlNet, leverages coarsely structural consistency from input motion sequences, and introduces three modules to improve video generation. Firstly, to ensure appearance coherence between frames, ControlVideo adds fully cross-frame interaction in self-attention modules. Secondly, to mitigate the flicker effect, it introduces an interleaved-frame smoother that employs frame interpolation on alternated frames. Finally, to produce long videos efficiently, it utilizes a hierarchical sampler that separately synthesizes each short clip with holistic coherency. Empowered with these modules, ControlVideo outperforms the state-of-the-arts on extensive motion-prompt pairs quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, thanks to the efficient designs, it generates both short and long videos within several minutes using one NVIDIA 2080Ti. Code is available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/ControlVideo.

**Title:** InheritSumm: A General, Versatile and Compact Summarizer by Distilling  from GPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13083  
**Abstract:** While large models such as GPT-3 demonstrate exceptional performance in zeroshot and fewshot summarization tasks, their extensive serving and fine-tuning costs hinder their utilization in various applications. Conversely, previous studies have found that although automatic metrics tend to favor smaller fine-tuned models, the quality of the summaries they generate is inferior to that of larger models like GPT-3 when assessed by human evaluators. To address this issue, we propose InheritSumm, a versatile and compact summarization model derived from GPT-3.5 through distillation. InheritSumm not only exhibits comparable zeroshot and fewshot summarization capabilities to GPT-3.5 but is also sufficiently compact for fine-tuning purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that InheritSumm achieves similar or superior performance to GPT-3.5 in zeroshot and fewshot settings. Furthermore, it outperforms the previously established best small models in both prefix-tuning and full-data fine-tuning scenarios.

**Title:** Observations on LLMs for Telecom Domain: Capabilities and Limitations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13102  
**Abstract:** The landscape for building conversational interfaces (chatbots) has witnessed a paradigm shift with recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT by OpenAI (GPT3.5 and GPT4), Google's Bard, Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), among others. In this paper, we analyze capabilities and limitations of incorporating such models in conversational interfaces for the telecommunication domain, specifically for enterprise wireless products and services. Using Cradlepoint's publicly available data for our experiments, we present a comparative analysis of the responses from such models for multiple use-cases including domain adaptation for terminology and product taxonomy, context continuity, robustness to input perturbations and errors. We believe this evaluation would provide useful insights to data scientists engaged in building customized conversational interfaces for domain-specific requirements.

**Title:** Rethinking the Evaluation for Conversational Recommendation in the Era  of Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13112  
**Abstract:** The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has shown great potential to develop more powerful conversational recommender systems (CRSs), which rely on natural language conversations to satisfy user needs. In this paper, we embark on an investigation into the utilization of ChatGPT for conversational recommendation, revealing the inadequacy of the existing evaluation protocol. It might over-emphasize the matching with the ground-truth items or utterances generated by human annotators, while neglecting the interactive nature of being a capable CRS. To overcome the limitation, we further propose an interactive Evaluation approach based on LLMs named iEvaLM that harnesses LLM-based user simulators. Our evaluation approach can simulate various interaction scenarios between users and systems. Through the experiments on two publicly available CRS datasets, we demonstrate notable improvements compared to the prevailing evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we emphasize the evaluation of explainability, and ChatGPT showcases persuasive explanation generation for its recommendations. Our study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the untapped potential of LLMs for CRSs and provides a more flexible and easy-to-use evaluation framework for future research endeavors. The codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/iEvaLM-CRS.

**Title:** Exploring User Perspectives on ChatGPT: Applications, Perceptions, and  Implications for AI-Integrated Education  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13114  
**Abstract:** Understanding user perspectives on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is essential for creating pedagogically effective and ethically responsible AI-integrated learning environments. In this paper, we conduct an extensive qualitative content analysis of four major social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and LinkedIn) to explore the user experience (UX) and perspectives of early adopters toward ChatGPT-an AI Chatbot technology-in various education sectors. We investigate the primary applications of ChatGPT in education (RQ1) and the various perceptions of the technology (RQ2). Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is most popularly used in the contexts of higher education (24.18%), K-12 education (22.09%), and practical-skills learning (15.28%). On social media platforms, the most frequently discussed topics about ChatGPT are productivity, efficiency, and ethics. While early adopters generally lean toward seeing ChatGPT as a revolutionary technology with the potential to boost students' self-efficacy and motivation to learn, others express concern that overreliance on the AI system may promote superficial learning habits and erode students' social and critical thinking skills. Our study contributes to the broader discourse on Human-AI Interaction and offers recommendations based on crowd-sourced knowledge for educators and learners interested in incorporating ChatGPT into their educational settings. Furthermore, we propose a research agenda for future studies that sets the foundation for continued investigation into the application of ChatGPT in education.

**Title:** Policy Representation via Diffusion Probability Model for Reinforcement  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13122  
**Abstract:** Popular reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tend to produce a unimodal policy distribution, which weakens the expressiveness of complicated policy and decays the ability of exploration. The diffusion probability model is powerful to learn complicated multimodal distributions, which has shown promising and potential applications to RL. In this paper, we formally build a theoretical foundation of policy representation via the diffusion probability model and provide practical implementations of diffusion policy for online model-free RL. Concretely, we character diffusion policy as a stochastic process, which is a new approach to representing a policy. Then we present a convergence guarantee for diffusion policy, which provides a theory to understand the multimodality of diffusion policy. Furthermore, we propose the DIPO which is an implementation for model-free online RL with DIffusion POlicy. To the best of our knowledge, DIPO is the first algorithm to solve model-free online RL problems with the diffusion model. Finally, extensive empirical results show the effectiveness and superiority of DIPO on the standard continuous control Mujoco benchmark.

**Title:** Can ChatGPT Defend the Truth? Automatic Dialectical Evaluation Elicits  LLMs' Deficiencies in Reasoning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13160  
**Abstract:** We explore testing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation that probes deeper into their understanding of the subject. Specifically, we formulate a new task where given a question, the LLM can generate a correct solution while the user believes in a wrong solution in the beginning, and they need to discuss to make the correct decision through dialogue. Such a setting requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own (which could be done by shallow memorization), but also be able to defend the truth instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. To automate this evaluation framework and save human labor, we simulate the user using another LLM conditioned on a synthesized wrong solution. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and tasks from BIG-Bench, we find that despite being able to generate correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, ChatGPT cannot maintain its belief in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by often-time absurdly invalid arguments. Our work reveals LLMs' weaknesses not captured by conventional benchmarking, and also points to danger zones of aligning models with human feedback.

**Title:** VLAB: Enhancing Video Language Pre-training by Feature Adapting and  Blending  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13167  
**Abstract:** Large-scale image-text contrastive pre-training models, such as CLIP, have been demonstrated to effectively learn high-quality multimodal representations. However, there is limited research on learning video-text representations for general video multimodal tasks based on these powerful features. Towards this goal, we propose a novel video-text pre-training method dubbed VLAB: Video Language pre-training by feature Adapting and Blending, which transfers CLIP representations to video pre-training tasks and develops unified video multimodal models for a wide range of video-text tasks. Specifically, VLAB is founded on two key strategies: feature adapting and feature blending. In the former, we introduce a new video adapter module to address CLIP's deficiency in modeling temporal information and extend the model's capability to encompass both contrastive and generative tasks. In the latter, we propose an end-to-end training method that further enhances the model's performance by exploiting the complementarity of image and video features. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of VLAB through extensive experiments on highly competitive video multimodal tasks, including video text retrieval, video captioning, and video question answering. Remarkably, VLAB outperforms competing methods significantly and sets new records in video question answering on MSRVTT, MSVD, and TGIF datasets. It achieves an accuracy of 49.6, 61.0, and 79.0, respectively. Codes and models will be released.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13168  
**Abstract:** This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We employ eight distinct datasets that encompass aspects including entity, relation and event extraction, link prediction, and question answering. Empirically, our findings suggest that GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT in the majority of tasks and even surpasses fine-tuned models in certain reasoning and question-answering datasets. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, which culminates in the presentation of the Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the VINE dataset. Drawing on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs for KG construction and reasoning, which aims to chart the future of this field and offer exciting opportunities for advancement. We anticipate that our research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings of KG\footnote{Code and datasets will be available in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.

**Title:** Teaching Probabilistic Logical Reasoning to Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13179  
**Abstract:** Recent research on transformer-based language models investigates their reasoning ability over logical rules expressed in natural language text. However, their logic is not yet well-understood as we cannot explain the abstractions made by the models that help them in reasoning. These models are criticized for merely memorizing complex patterns in the data, which often creates issues for their generalizability in unobserved situations. In this work, we analyze the use of probabilistic logical rules in transformer-based language models. In particular, we propose a new approach, Probabilistic Constraint Training (PCT), that explicitly models probabilistic logical reasoning by imposing the rules of reasoning as constraints during training. We create a new QA benchmark for evaluating probabilistic reasoning over uncertain textual rules, which creates instance-specific rules, unlike the only existing relevant benchmark. Experimental results show that our proposed technique improves the base language models' accuracy and explainability when probabilistic logical reasoning is required for question answering. Moreover, we show that the learned probabilistic reasoning abilities are transferable to novel situations.

**Title:** ImSimCSE: Improving Contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings from  Two Perspectives  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13192  
**Abstract:** This paper aims to improve contrastive learning for sentence embeddings from two perspectives: handling dropout noise and addressing feature corruption. Specifically, for the first perspective, we identify that the dropout noise from negative pairs affects the model's performance. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective method to deal with such type of noise. Secondly, we pinpoint the rank bottleneck of current solutions to feature corruption and propose a dimension-wise contrastive learning objective to address this issue. Both proposed methods are generic and can be applied to any contrastive learning based models for sentence embeddings. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that combining both proposed methods leads to a gain of 1.8 points compared to the strong baseline SimCSE configured with BERT base. Furthermore, applying the proposed method to DiffCSE, another strong contrastive learning based baseline, results in a gain of 1.4 points.

**Title:** U-DiT TTS: U-Diffusion Vision Transformer for Text-to-Speech  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13195  
**Abstract:** Deep learning has led to considerable advances in text-to-speech synthesis. Most recently, the adoption of Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs), has gained traction due to their ability to produce high-quality synthesized neural speech in neural speech synthesis systems. In SGMs, the U-Net architecture and its variants have long dominated as the backbone since its first successful adoption. In this research, we mainly focus on the neural network in diffusion-model-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems and propose the U-DiT architecture, exploring the potential of vision transformer architecture as the core component of the diffusion models in a TTS system. The modular design of the U-DiT architecture, inherited from the best parts of U-Net and ViT, allows for great scalability and versatility across different data scales. The proposed U-DiT TTS system is a mel spectrogram-based acoustic model and utilizes a pretrained HiFi-GAN as the vocoder. The objective (ie Frechet distance) and MOS results show that our DiT-TTS system achieves state-of-art performance on the single speaker dataset LJSpeech. Our demos are publicly available at: https://eihw.github.io/u-dit-tts/

**Title:** Challenging Decoder helps in Masked Auto-Encoder Pre-training for Dense  Passage Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13197  
**Abstract:** Recently, various studies have been directed towards exploring dense passage retrieval techniques employing pre-trained language models, among which the masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training architecture has emerged as the most promising. The conventional MAE framework relies on leveraging the passage reconstruction of decoder to bolster the text representation ability of encoder, thereby enhancing the performance of resulting dense retrieval systems. Within the context of building the representation ability of the encoder through passage reconstruction of decoder, it is reasonable to postulate that a ``more demanding'' decoder will necessitate a corresponding increase in the encoder's ability. To this end, we propose a novel token importance aware masking strategy based on pointwise mutual information to intensify the challenge of the decoder. Importantly, our approach can be implemented in an unsupervised manner, without adding additional expenses to the pre-training phase. Our experiments verify that the proposed method is both effective and robust on large-scale supervised passage retrieval datasets and out-of-domain zero-shot retrieval benchmarks.

**Title:** Improving Isochronous Machine Translation with Target Factors and  Auxiliary Counters  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13204  
**Abstract:** To translate speech for automatic dubbing, machine translation needs to be isochronous, i.e. translated speech needs to be aligned with the source in terms of speech durations. We introduce target factors in a transformer model to predict durations jointly with target language phoneme sequences. We also introduce auxiliary counters to help the decoder to keep track of the timing information while generating target phonemes. We show that our model improves translation quality and isochrony compared to previous work where the translation model is instead trained to predict interleaved sequences of phonemes and durations.

**Title:** Logical Reasoning for Natural Language Inference Using Generated Facts  as Atoms  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13214  
**Abstract:** State-of-the-art neural models can now reach human performance levels across various natural language understanding tasks. However, despite this impressive performance, models are known to learn from annotation artefacts at the expense of the underlying task. While interpretability methods can identify influential features for each prediction, there are no guarantees that these features are responsible for the model decisions. Instead, we introduce a model-agnostic logical framework to determine the specific information in an input responsible for each model decision. This method creates interpretable Natural Language Inference (NLI) models that maintain their predictive power. We achieve this by generating facts that decompose complex NLI observations into individual logical atoms. Our model makes predictions for each atom and uses logical rules to decide the class of the observation based on the predictions for each atom. We apply our method to the highly challenging ANLI dataset, where our framework improves the performance of both a DeBERTa-base and BERT baseline. Our method performs best on the most challenging examples, achieving a new state-of-the-art for the ANLI round 3 test set. We outperform every baseline in a reduced-data setting, and despite using no annotations for the generated facts, our model predictions for individual facts align with human expectations.

**Title:** Multi-Task Instruction Tuning of LLaMa for Specific Scenarios: A  Preliminary Study on Writing Assistance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13225  
**Abstract:** ChatGPT and GPT-4 have attracted substantial interest from both academic and industrial circles, owing to their remarkable few-shot (or even zero-shot) ability to handle various tasks. Recent work shows that, after being fine-tuned with a few sets of instruction-driven data, the recently proposed LLM, LLaMa, exhibits an impressive capability to address a broad range of tasks. However, the zero-shot performance of LLMs does not consistently outperform that of models fined-tuned for specific scenarios. To explore whether the capabilities of LLMs can be further enhanced for specific scenarios, we choose the writing-assistance scenario as the testbed, including seven writing tasks. We collect training data for these tasks, reframe them in an instruction-following format, and subsequently refine LLaMa via instruction tuning. Experimental results show that continually fine-tuning LLaMa on writing instruction data significantly improves its ability on writing tasks. We also conduct more experiments and analyses to offer insights for future work on effectively fine-tuning LLaMa for specific scenarios.

**Title:** The Dimensions of Data Labor: A Road Map for Researchers, Activists, and  Policymakers to Empower Data Producers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13238  
**Abstract:** Many recent technological advances (e.g. ChatGPT and search engines) are possible only because of massive amounts of user-generated data produced through user interactions with computing systems or scraped from the web (e.g. behavior logs, user-generated content, and artwork). However, data producers have little say in what data is captured, how it is used, or who it benefits. Organizations with the ability to access and process this data, e.g. OpenAI and Google, possess immense power in shaping the technology landscape. By synthesizing related literature that reconceptualizes the production of data for computing as ``data labor'', we outline opportunities for researchers, policymakers, and activists to empower data producers in their relationship with tech companies, e.g advocating for transparency about data reuse, creating feedback channels between data producers and companies, and potentially developing mechanisms to share data's revenue more broadly. In doing so, we characterize data labor with six important dimensions - legibility, end-use awareness, collaboration requirement, openness, replaceability, and livelihood overlap - based on the parallels between data labor and various other types of labor in the computing literature.

**Title:** Chip-Chat: Challenges and Opportunities in Conversational Hardware  Design  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13243  
**Abstract:** Modern hardware design starts with specifications provided in natural language. These are then translated by hardware engineers into appropriate Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog before synthesizing circuit elements. Automating this translation could reduce sources of human error from the engineering process. But, it is only recently that artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated capabilities for machine-based end-to-end design translations. Commercially-available instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard claim to be able to produce code in a variety of programming languages; but studies examining them for hardware are still lacking. In this work, we thus explore the challenges faced and opportunities presented when leveraging these recent advances in LLMs for hardware design. Using a suite of 8 representative benchmarks, we examined the capabilities and limitations of the state of the art conversational LLMs when producing Verilog for functional and verification purposes. Given that the LLMs performed best when used interactively, we then performed a longer fully conversational case study where a hardware engineer co-designed a novel 8-bit accumulator-based microprocessor architecture. We sent the benchmarks and processor to tapeout in a Skywater 130nm shuttle, meaning that these 'Chip-Chats' resulted in what we believe to be the world's first wholly-AI-written HDL for tapeout.

**Title:** GQA: Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head  Checkpoints  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245  
**Abstract:** Multi-query attention (MQA), which only uses a single key-value head, drastically speeds up decoder inference. However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.

**Title:** Watermarking Text Data on Large Language Models for Dataset Copyright  Protection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13257  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BERT and GPT-based models like ChatGPT, have recently demonstrated their impressive capacity for learning language representations, yielding significant benefits for various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the immense data requirements of these large models have incited substantial concerns regarding copyright protection and data privacy. In an attempt to address these issues, particularly the unauthorized use of private data in LLMs, we introduce a novel watermarking technique via a backdoor-based membership inference approach, i.e., TextMarker, which can safeguard diverse forms of private information embedded in the training text data in LLMs. Specifically, TextMarker is a new membership inference framework that can eliminate the necessity for additional proxy data and surrogate model training, which are common in traditional membership inference techniques, thereby rendering our proposal significantly more practical and applicable.

**Title:** Evaluating ChatGPT's Performance for Multilingual and Emoji-based Hate  Speech Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13276  
**Abstract:** Hate speech is a severe issue that affects many online platforms. So far, several studies have been performed to develop robust hate speech detection systems. Large language models like ChatGPT have recently shown great potential in performing several tasks, including hate speech detection. However, it is crucial to comprehend the limitations of these models to build more robust hate speech detection systems. Thus to bridge the gap, our study aims to evaluate the weaknesses of the ChatGPT model in detecting hate speech at a granular level across 11 languages. In addition, we investigate the influence of complex emotions, such as the use of emojis in hate speech, on the performance of the ChatGPT model. Through our analysis, we examine and investigate the errors made by the model, shedding light on its shortcomings in detecting certain types of hate speech and highlighting the need for further research and improvements in hate speech detection.

**Title:** VideoLLM: Modeling Video Sequence with Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13292  
**Abstract:** With the exponential growth of video data, there is an urgent need for automated technology to analyze and comprehend video content. However, existing video understanding models are often task-specific and lack a comprehensive capability of handling diverse tasks. The success of large language models (LLMs) like GPT has demonstrated their impressive abilities in sequence causal reasoning. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel framework called VideoLLM that leverages the sequence reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs from natural language processing (NLP) for video sequence understanding. VideoLLM incorporates a carefully designed Modality Encoder and Semantic Translator, which convert inputs from various modalities into a unified token sequence. This token sequence is then fed into a decoder-only LLM. Subsequently, with the aid of a simple task head, our VideoLLM yields an effective unified framework for different kinds of video understanding tasks. To evaluate the efficacy of VideoLLM, we conduct extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and fine-tuning methods. We evaluate our VideoLLM on eight tasks sourced from four different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively transferred to video understanding tasks.

**Title:** Parallel Attention and Feed-Forward Net Design for Pre-training and  Inference on Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13297  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce Parallel Attention and Feed-Forward Net Design (PAF) for transformer models. Transformer models are indisputably the backbone of all Natural Language Processing applications. Therefore, any efforts aimed at improving their efficiency are guaranteed to have an enormous impact. Transformer models consist of many layers and each layer has an attention block followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) that processes the input based on the attention block's output. We refer to this standard design as Series Attention and Feed-Forward Net Design (SAF). For each layer in our proposed PAF design for transformer models, we make FFN block's computations independent of the output of the attention block. This decoupling allows FFN block of each layer to run in parallel to the attention block of that layer. We evaluate PAF design by training two large language models (RoBERTa-large and bert-large-uncased) and comparing them to their SAF counterparts on six tasks of the General Language Understanding (GLUE) benchmark which test a multitude of semantic attributes. PAF models achieves nearly identical performance as their SAF counterparts on all the six tasks. We also compare time complexities of attention blocks with FFN blocks and find that running both blocks in parallel can theoretically and in practice achieve upto 1.5x to 2x gains in speed. We leave the development of fast and efficient libraries for implementation of PAF design for future work.

**Title:** DiffusionNER: Boundary Diffusion for Named Entity Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13298  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose DiffusionNER, which formulates the named entity recognition task as a boundary-denoising diffusion process and thus generates named entities from noisy spans. During training, DiffusionNER gradually adds noises to the golden entity boundaries by a fixed forward diffusion process and learns a reverse diffusion process to recover the entity boundaries. In inference, DiffusionNER first randomly samples some noisy spans from a standard Gaussian distribution and then generates the named entities by denoising them with the learned reverse diffusion process. The proposed boundary-denoising diffusion process allows progressive refinement and dynamic sampling of entities, empowering DiffusionNER with efficient and flexible entity generation capability. Experiments on multiple flat and nested NER datasets demonstrate that DiffusionNER achieves comparable or even better performance than previous state-of-the-art models.

**Title:** Measuring Inductive Biases of In-Context Learning with Underspecified  Demonstrations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13299  
**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is an important paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks, but the generalization behavior of ICL remains poorly understood. We investigate the inductive biases of ICL from the perspective of feature bias: which feature ICL is more likely to use given a set of underspecified demonstrations in which two features are equally predictive of the labels. First, we characterize the feature biases of GPT-3 models by constructing underspecified demonstrations from a range of NLP datasets and feature combinations. We find that LLMs exhibit clear feature biases - for example, demonstrating a strong bias to predict labels according to sentiment rather than shallow lexical features, like punctuation. Second, we evaluate the effect of different interventions that are designed to impose an inductive bias in favor of a particular feature, such as adding a natural language instruction or using semantically relevant label words. We find that, while many interventions can influence the learner to prefer a particular feature, it can be difficult to overcome strong prior biases. Overall, our results provide a broader picture of the types of features that ICL may be more likely to exploit and how to impose inductive biases that are better aligned with the intended task.

**Title:** Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13301  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models are a class of flexible generative models trained with an approximation to the log-likelihood objective. However, most use cases of diffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with downstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for directly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted likelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image diffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image alignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for additional data collection or human annotation.

**Title:** Language-Agnostic Bias Detection in Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13302  
**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) are key components in NLP, but they contain strong social biases. Quantifying these biases is challenging because current methods focusing on fill-the-mask objectives are sensitive to slight changes in input. To address this, we propose LABDet, a robust language-agnostic method for evaluating bias in PLMs. For nationality as a case study, we show that LABDet "surfaces" nationality bias by training a classifier on top of a frozen PLM on non-nationality sentiment detection. Collaborating with political scientists, we find consistent patterns of nationality bias across monolingual PLMs in six languages that align with historical and political context. We also show for English BERT that bias surfaced by LABDet correlates well with bias in the pretraining data; thus, our work is one of the few studies that directly links pretraining data to PLM behavior. Finally, we verify LABDet's reliability and applicability to different templates and languages through an extensive set of robustness checks.

**Title:** RecurrentGPT: Interactive Generation of (Arbitrarily) Long Text  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13304  
**Abstract:** The fixed-size context of Transformer makes GPT models incapable of generating arbitrarily long text. In this paper, we introduce RecurrentGPT, a language-based simulacrum of the recurrence mechanism in RNNs. RecurrentGPT is built upon a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT and uses natural language to simulate the Long Short-Term Memory mechanism in an LSTM. At each timestep, RecurrentGPT generates a paragraph of text and updates its language-based long-short term memory stored on the hard drive and the prompt, respectively. This recurrence mechanism enables RecurrentGPT to generate texts of arbitrary length without forgetting. Since human users can easily observe and edit the natural language memories, RecurrentGPT is interpretable and enables interactive generation of long text. RecurrentGPT is an initial step towards next-generation computer-assisted writing systems beyond local editing suggestions. In addition to producing AI-generated content (AIGC), we also demonstrate the possibility of using RecurrentGPT as an interactive fiction that directly interacts with consumers. We call this usage of generative models by ``AI As Contents'' (AIAC), which we believe is the next form of conventional AIGC. We further demonstrate the possibility of using RecurrentGPT to create personalized interactive fiction that directly interacts with readers instead of interacting with writers. More broadly, RecurrentGPT demonstrates the utility of borrowing ideas from popular model designs in cognitive science and deep learning for prompting LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/RecurrentGPT and an online demo is available at https://www.aiwaves.org/recurrentgpt.

**Title:** NeRFuser: Large-Scale Scene Representation by NeRF Fusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13307  
**Abstract:** A practical benefit of implicit visual representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) is their memory efficiency: large scenes can be efficiently stored and shared as small neural nets instead of collections of images. However, operating on these implicit visual data structures requires extending classical image-based vision techniques (e.g., registration, blending) from image sets to neural fields. Towards this goal, we propose NeRFuser, a novel architecture for NeRF registration and blending that assumes only access to pre-generated NeRFs, and not the potentially large sets of images used to generate them. We propose registration from re-rendering, a technique to infer the transformation between NeRFs based on images synthesized from individual NeRFs. For blending, we propose sample-based inverse distance weighting to blend visual information at the ray-sample level. We evaluate NeRFuser on public benchmarks and a self-collected object-centric indoor dataset, showing the robustness of our method, including to views that are challenging to render from the individual source NeRFs.

**Title:** If at First You Don't Succeed, Try, Try Again: Faithful Diffusion-based  Text-to-Image Generation by Selection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13308  
**Abstract:** Despite their impressive capabilities, diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models can lack faithfulness to the text prompt, where generated images may not contain all the mentioned objects, attributes or relations. To alleviate these issues, recent works proposed post-hoc methods to improve model faithfulness without costly retraining, by modifying how the model utilizes the input prompt. In this work, we take a step back and show that large T2I diffusion models are more faithful than usually assumed, and can generate images faithful to even complex prompts without the need to manipulate the generative process. Based on that, we show how faithfulness can be simply treated as a candidate selection problem instead, and introduce a straightforward pipeline that generates candidate images for a text prompt and picks the best one according to an automatic scoring system that can leverage already existing T2I evaluation metrics. Quantitative comparisons alongside user studies on diverse benchmarks show consistently improved faithfulness over post-hoc enhancement methods, with comparable or lower computational cost.

**Title:** VDT: An Empirical Study on Video Diffusion with Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13311  
**Abstract:** This work introduces Video Diffusion Transformer (VDT), which pioneers the use of transformers in diffusion-based video generation. It features transformer blocks with modularized temporal and spatial attention modules, allowing separate optimization of each component and leveraging the rich spatial-temporal representation inherited from transformers. VDT offers several appealing benefits. 1) It excels at capturing temporal dependencies to produce temporally consistent video frames and even simulate the dynamics of 3D objects over time. 2) It enables flexible conditioning information through simple concatenation in the token space, effectively unifying video generation and prediction tasks. 3) Its modularized design facilitates a spatial-temporal decoupled training strategy, leading to improved efficiency. Extensive experiments on video generation, prediction, and dynamics modeling (i.e., physics-based QA) tasks have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of VDT in various scenarios, including autonomous driving, human action, and physics-based simulation.

**Title:** ChatGPT and the Labor Market: Unraveling the Effect of AI Discussions on  Students' Earnings Expectations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11900  
**Abstract:** This paper investigates the causal impact of negatively and positively framed ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) discussions on US students' anticipated labor market outcomes. Our findings reveal students reduce their confidence regarding their future earnings prospects after exposure to AI debates, and this effect is more pronounced after reading discussion excerpts with a negative tone. Unlike STEM majors, students in Non-STEM fields show asymmetric and pessimistic belief changes, suggesting that they might feel more vulnerable to emerging AI technologies. Pessimistic belief updates regarding future earnings are also prevalent across gender and GPA levels, indicating widespread AI concerns among all student subgroups. Educators, administrators, and policymakers may regularly engage with students to address their concerns and enhance educational curricula to better prepare them for a future that will be inevitably shaped by AI.

**Title:** Instrumental Variable Learning for Chest X-ray Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12070  
**Abstract:** The chest X-ray (CXR) is commonly employed to diagnose thoracic illnesses, but the challenge of achieving accurate automatic diagnosis through this method persists due to the complex relationship between pathology. In recent years, various deep learning-based approaches have been suggested to tackle this problem but confounding factors such as image resolution or noise problems often damage model performance. In this paper, we focus on the chest X-ray classification task and proposed an interpretable instrumental variable (IV) learning framework, to eliminate the spurious association and obtain accurate causal representation. Specifically, we first construct a structural causal model (SCM) for our task and learn the confounders and the preliminary representations of IV, we then leverage electronic health record (EHR) as auxiliary information and we fuse the above feature with our transformer-based semantic fusion module, so the IV has the medical semantic. Meanwhile, the reliability of IV is further guaranteed via the constraints of mutual information between related causal variables. Finally, our approach's performance is demonstrated using the MIMIC-CXR, NIH ChestX-ray 14, and CheXpert datasets, and we achieve competitive results.

**Title:** Dual-Diffusion: Dual Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic  Models for Blind Super-Resolution Reconstruction in RSIs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12170  
**Abstract:** Previous super-resolution reconstruction (SR) works are always designed on the assumption that the degradation operation is fixed, such as bicubic downsampling. However, as for remote sensing images, some unexpected factors can cause the blurred visual performance, like weather factors, orbit altitude, etc. Blind SR methods are proposed to deal with various degradations. There are two main challenges of blind SR in RSIs: 1) the accu-rate estimation of degradation kernels; 2) the realistic image generation in the ill-posed problem. To rise to the challenge, we propose a novel blind SR framework based on dual conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDSR). In our work, we introduce conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) from two aspects: kernel estimation progress and re-construction progress, named as the dual-diffusion. As for kernel estimation progress, conditioned on low-resolution (LR) images, a new DDPM-based kernel predictor is constructed by studying the invertible mapping between the kernel distribution and the latent distribution. As for reconstruction progress, regarding the predicted degradation kernels and LR images as conditional information, we construct a DDPM-based reconstructor to learning the mapping from the LR images to HR images. Com-prehensive experiments show the priority of our proposal com-pared with SOTA blind SR methods. Source Code is available at https://github.com/Lincoln20030413/DDSR

**Title:** Learning Joint 2D & 3D Diffusion Models for Complete Molecule Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12347  
**Abstract:** Designing new molecules is essential for drug discovery and material science. Recently, deep generative models that aim to model molecule distribution have made promising progress in narrowing down the chemical research space and generating high-fidelity molecules. However, current generative models only focus on modeling either 2D bonding graphs or 3D geometries, which are two complementary descriptors for molecules. The lack of ability to jointly model both limits the improvement of generation quality and further downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new joint 2D and 3D diffusion model (JODO) that generates complete molecules with atom types, formal charges, bond information, and 3D coordinates. To capture the correlation between molecular graphs and geometries in the diffusion process, we develop a Diffusion Graph Transformer to parameterize the data prediction model that recovers the original data from noisy data. The Diffusion Graph Transformer interacts node and edge representations based on our relational attention mechanism, while simultaneously propagating and updating scalar features and geometric vectors. Our model can also be extended for inverse molecular design targeting single or multiple quantum properties. In our comprehensive evaluation pipeline for unconditional joint generation, the results of the experiment show that JODO remarkably outperforms the baselines on the QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets. Furthermore, our model excels in few-step fast sampling, as well as in inverse molecule design and molecular graph generation. Our code is provided in https://github.com/GRAPH-0/JODO.

**Title:** Quasi-Monte Carlo Graph Random Features  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12470  
**Abstract:** We present a novel mechanism to improve the accuracy of the recently-introduced class of graph random features (GRFs). Our method induces negative correlations between the lengths of the algorithm's random walks by imposing antithetic termination: a procedure to sample more diverse random walks which may be of independent interest. It has a trivial drop-in implementation. We derive strong theoretical guarantees on the properties of these quasi-Monte Carlo GRFs (q-GRFs), proving that they yield lower-variance estimators of the 2-regularised Laplacian kernel under mild conditions. Remarkably, our results hold for any graph topology. We demonstrate empirical accuracy improvements on a variety of tasks including a new practical application: time-efficient approximation of the graph diffusion process. To our knowledge, q-GRFs constitute the first rigorously studied quasi-Monte Carlo scheme for kernels defined on combinatorial objects, inviting new research on correlations between graph random walks.

**Title:** Multi-Head State Space Model for Speech Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12498  
**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have recently shown promising results on small-scale sequence and language modelling tasks, rivalling and outperforming many attention-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-head state space (MH-SSM) architecture equipped with special gating mechanisms, where parallel heads are taught to learn local and global temporal dynamics on sequence data. As a drop-in replacement for multi-head attention in transformer encoders, this new model significantly outperforms the transformer transducer on the LibriSpeech speech recognition corpus. Furthermore, we augment the transformer block with MH-SSMs layers, referred to as the Stateformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the LibriSpeech task, with word error rates of 1.76\%/4.37\% on the development and 1.91\%/4.36\% on the test sets without using an external language model.

**Title:** Your smartphone could act as a pulse-oximeter and as a single-lead ECG  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12583  
**Abstract:** In the post-covid19 era, every new wave of the pandemic causes an increased concern among the masses to learn more about their state of well-being. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to come up with ubiquitous, low-cost, non-invasive tools for rapid and continuous monitoring of body vitals that reflect the status of one's overall health. In this backdrop, this work proposes a deep learning approach to turn a smartphone-the popular hand-held personal gadget-into a diagnostic tool to measure/monitor the three most important body vitals, i.e., pulse rate (PR), blood oxygen saturation level (aka SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR). Furthermore, we propose another method that could extract a single-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) of the subject. The proposed methods include the following core steps: subject records a small video of his/her fingertip by placing his/her finger on the rear camera of the smartphone, and the recorded video is pre-processed to extract the filtered and/or detrended video-photoplethysmography (vPPG) signal, which is then fed to custom-built convolutional neural networks (CNN), which eventually spit-out the vitals (PR, SpO2, and RR) as well as a single-lead ECG of the subject. To be precise, the contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) estimation of the three body vitals (PR, SpO2, RR) from the vPPG data using custom-built CNNs, vision transformer, and most importantly by CLIP model; 2) a novel discrete cosine transform+feedforward neural network-based method that translates the recorded video- PPG signal to a single-lead ECG signal. The proposed method is anticipated to find its application in several use-case scenarios, e.g., remote healthcare, mobile health, fitness, sports, etc.

**Title:** SG-GAN: Fine Stereoscopic-Aware Generation for 3D Brain Point Cloud  Up-sampling from a Single Image  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12646  
**Abstract:** In minimally-invasive brain surgeries with indirect and narrow operating environments, 3D brain reconstruction is crucial. However, as requirements of accuracy for some new minimally-invasive surgeries (such as brain-computer interface surgery) are higher and higher, the outputs of conventional 3D reconstruction, such as point cloud (PC), are facing the challenges that sample points are too sparse and the precision is insufficient. On the other hand, there is a scarcity of high-density point cloud datasets, which makes it challenging to train models for direct reconstruction of high-density brain point clouds. In this work, a novel model named stereoscopic-aware graph generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) with two stages is proposed to generate fine high-density PC conditioned on a single image. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and basic structure of the organ based on the given image, yielding Stage-I point clouds. The Stage-II GAN takes the results from Stage-I and generates high-density point clouds with detailed features. The Stage-II GAN is capable of correcting defects and restoring the detailed features of the region of interest (ROI) through the up-sampling process. Furthermore, a parameter-free-attention-based free-transforming module is developed to learn the efficient features of input, while upholding a promising performance. Comparing with the existing methods, the SG-GAN model shows superior performance in terms of visual quality, objective measurements, and performance in classification, as demonstrated by comprehensive results measured by several evaluation metrics including PC-to-PC error and Chamfer distance.

**Title:** ViT-TTS: Visual Text-to-Speech with Scalable Diffusion Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12708  
**Abstract:** Text-to-speech(TTS) has undergone remarkable improvements in performance, particularly with the advent of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). However, the perceived quality of audio depends not solely on its content, pitch, rhythm, and energy, but also on the physical environment. In this work, we propose ViT-TTS, the first visual TTS model with scalable diffusion transformers. ViT-TTS complement the phoneme sequence with the visual information to generate high-perceived audio, opening up new avenues for practical applications of AR and VR to allow a more immersive and realistic audio experience. To mitigate the data scarcity in learning visual acoustic information, we 1) introduce a self-supervised learning framework to enhance both the visual-text encoder and denoiser decoder; 2) leverage the diffusion transformer scalable in terms of parameters and capacity to learn visual scene information. Experimental results demonstrate that ViT-TTS achieves new state-of-the-art results, outperforming cascaded systems and other baselines regardless of the visibility of the scene. With low-resource data (1h, 2h, 5h), ViT-TTS achieves comparative results with rich-resource baselines.~\footnote{Audio samples are available at \url{https://ViT-TTS.github.io/.}}

**Title:** Analytical approximations in short times of exact operational solutions  to reaction diffusion problems on bounded intervals  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12911  
**Abstract:** This paper aims at obtaining, by means of integral transforms, analytical approximations in short times of solutions to boundary value problems for the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with constant coefficients. The general form of the equation is considered on a bounded generic interval and the three classical types of boundary conditions, i.e., Dirichlet as well as Neumann and mixed boundary conditions are considered in a unified way. The Fourier and Laplace integral transforms are successively applied and an exact solution is obtained in the Laplace domain. This operational solution is proven to be the accurate Laplace transform of the infinite series obtained by the Fourier decomposition method and presented in the literature as solutions to this type of problem. On the basis of this unified operational solution, four cases are distinguished where innovative formulas expressing consistent analytical approximations in short time limits are derived with respect to the behavior of the solution at the boundaries. Compared to the infinite series solutions, the analytical approximations may open new perspectives and applications, among which can be noted the improvement of numerical efficiency in simulations of one-dimensional moving boundary problems, such as in Stefan models.

**Title:** Entropy bounds for invariant measure perturbations in stochastic systems  with uncertain noise  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12936  
**Abstract:** This paper is concerned with stochastic systems whose state is a diffusion process governed by an Ito stochastic differential equation (SDE). In the framework of a nominal white-noise model, the SDE is driven by a standard Wiener process. For a scenario of statistical uncertainty, where the driving noise acquires a state-dependent drift and thus deviates from its idealised model, we consider the perturbation of the invariant probability density function (PDF) as a steady-state solution of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. We discuss an upper bound on a logarithmic Dirichlet form for the ratio of the invariant PDF to its nominal counterpart in terms of the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy rate of the actual noise distribution with respect the Wiener measure. This bound is shown to be achievable, provided the PDF ratio is preserved by the nominal steady-state probability flux. The logarithmic Dirichlet form bound is used in order to obtain an upper bound on the relative entropy of the perturbed invariant PDF in terms of quadratic-exponential moments of the noise drift in the uniform ellipticity case. These results are illustrated for perturbations of Gaussian invariant measures in linear stochastic systems involving linear noise drifts.

**Title:** GSURE-Based Diffusion Model Training with Corrupted Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13128  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive results in both data generation and downstream tasks such as inverse problems, text-based editing, classification, and more. However, training such models usually requires large amounts of clean signals which are often difficult or impossible to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel training technique for generative diffusion models based only on corrupted data. We introduce a loss function based on the Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE), and prove that under some conditions, it is equivalent to the training objective used in fully supervised diffusion models. We demonstrate our technique on face images as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the use of undersampled data significantly alleviates data collection costs. Our approach achieves generative performance comparable to its fully supervised counterpart without training on any clean signals. In addition, we deploy the resulting diffusion model in various downstream tasks beyond the degradation present in the training set, showcasing promising results.

**Title:** DeepJSCC-l++: Robust and Bandwidth-Adaptive Wireless Image Transmission  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13161  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel vision transformer (ViT) based deep joint source channel coding (DeepJSCC) scheme, dubbed DeepJSCC-l++, which can be adaptive to multiple target bandwidth ratios as well as different channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using a single model. To achieve this, we train the proposed DeepJSCC-l++ model with different bandwidth ratios and SNRs, which are fed to the model as side information. The reconstruction losses corresponding to different bandwidth ratios are calculated, and a new training methodology is proposed, which dynamically assigns different weights to the losses of different bandwidth ratios according to their individual reconstruction qualities. Shifted window (Swin) transformer, is adopted as the backbone for our DeepJSCC-l++ model. Through extensive simulations it is shown that the proposed DeepJSCC-l++ and successive refinement models can adapt to different bandwidth ratios and channel SNRs with marginal performance loss compared to the separately trained models. We also observe the proposed schemes can outperform the digital baseline, which concatenates the BPG compression with capacity-achieving channel code.

**Title:** Sequential Transfer Learning to Decode Heard and Imagined Timbre from  fMRI Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13226  
**Abstract:** We present a sequential transfer learning framework for transformers on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate its significant benefits for decoding musical timbre. In the first of two phases, we pre-train our stacked-encoder transformer architecture on Next Thought Prediction, a self-supervised task of predicting whether or not one sequence of fMRI data follows another. This phase imparts a general understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of neural activity, and can be applied to any fMRI dataset. In the second phase, we fine-tune the pre-trained models and train additional fresh models on the supervised task of predicting whether or not two sequences of fMRI data were recorded while listening to the same musical timbre. The fine-tuned models achieve significantly higher accuracy with shorter training times than the fresh models, demonstrating the efficacy of our framework for facilitating transfer learning on fMRI data. Additionally, our fine-tuning task achieves a level of classification granularity beyond standard methods. This work contributes to the growing literature on transformer architectures for sequential transfer learning on fMRI data, and provides evidence that our framework is an improvement over current methods for decoding timbre.

Despite the considerable progress we have achieved, existing methods usually generate molecules in atom resolution and ignore intrinsic local structures such as rings, which leads to poor quality in generated structures, especially when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule generation is a promising strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for 3D non-autoregressive generations because of the combinational optimization problems. In this paper, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based model (i.e.~HierDiff) is proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without relying on autoregressive modeling. Specifically, HierDiff first generates coarse-grained molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each coarse-grained node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then the coarse-grained nodes are decoded into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and a newly designed iterative refined sampling module. Lastly, the fine-grained fragments are then assembled to derive a complete atomic molecular structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HierDiff consistently improves the quality of molecule generation over existing methods
