**Title:** Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14380  
**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed some issues of Multi-Head Attention (MHA), e.g., redundancy and over-parameterization. Specifically, the heads of MHA were originally designed to attend to information from different representation subspaces, whereas prior studies found that some attention heads likely learn similar features and can be pruned without harming performance. Inspired by the minimum-redundancy feature selection, we assume that focusing on the most representative and distinctive features with minimum resources can mitigate the above issues and lead to more effective and efficient MHAs. In particular, we propose Grouped Head Attention, trained with a self-supervised group constraint that group attention heads, where each group focuses on an essential but distinctive feature subset. We additionally propose a Voting-to-Stay procedure to remove redundant heads, thus achieving a transformer with lighter weights. Moreover, our method achieves significant performance gains on three well-established tasks while considerably compressing parameters.

**Title:** Connecting Multi-modal Contrastive Representations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14381  
**Abstract:** Multi-modal Contrastive Representation (MCR) learning aims to encode different modalities into a semantically aligned shared space. This paradigm shows remarkable generalization ability on numerous downstream tasks across various modalities. However, the reliance on massive high-quality data pairs limits its further development on more modalities. This paper proposes a novel training-efficient method for learning MCR without paired data called Connecting Multi-modal Contrastive Representations (C-MCR). Specifically, given two existing MCRs pre-trained on (A, B) and (B, C) modality pairs, we project them to a new space and use the data from the overlapping modality B to aligning the two MCRs in the new space. Meanwhile, since the modality pairs (A, B) and (B, C) are already aligned within each MCR, the connection learned by overlapping modality can also be transferred to non-overlapping modality pair (A, C). To unleash the potential of C-MCR, we further introduce a semantic-enhanced inter- and intra-MCR connection method. We first enhance the semantic consistency and completion of embeddings across different modalities for more robust alignment. Then we utilize the inter-MCR alignment to establish the connection, and employ the intra-MCR alignment to better maintain the connection for inputs from non-overlapping modalities. We take the field of audio-visual contrastive learning as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of C-MCR. We connect pre-trained CLIP and CLAP models via texts to derive audio-visual contrastive representations. Remarkably, without using any paired audio-visual data and further tuning, C-MCR achieves state-of-the-art performance on six datasets across three audio-visual downstream tasks.

**Title:** Adversarial Nibbler: A Data-Centric Challenge for Improving the Safety  of Text-to-Image Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14384  
**Abstract:** The generative AI revolution in recent years has been spurred by an expansion in compute power and data quantity, which together enable extensive pre-training of powerful text-to-image (T2I) models. With their greater capabilities to generate realistic and creative content, these T2I models like DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagen or Stable Diffusion are reaching ever wider audiences. Any unsafe behaviors inherited from pretraining on uncurated internet-scraped datasets thus have the potential to cause wide-reaching harm, for example, through generated images which are violent, sexually explicit, or contain biased and derogatory stereotypes. Despite this risk of harm, we lack systematic and structured evaluation datasets to scrutinize model behavior, especially adversarial attacks that bypass existing safety filters. A typical bottleneck in safety evaluation is achieving a wide coverage of different types of challenging examples in the evaluation set, i.e., identifying 'unknown unknowns' or long-tail problems. To address this need, we introduce the Adversarial Nibbler challenge. The goal of this challenge is to crowdsource a diverse set of failure modes and reward challenge participants for successfully finding safety vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art T2I models. Ultimately, we aim to provide greater awareness of these issues and assist developers in improving the future safety and reliability of generative AI models. Adversarial Nibbler is a data-centric challenge, part of the DataPerf challenge suite, organized and supported by Kaggle and MLCommons.

**Title:** Let GPT be a Math Tutor: Teaching Math Word Problem Solvers with  Customized Exercise Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14386  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a novel approach for distilling math word problem solving capabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student models. Our approach is designed to consider the student model's weaknesses and foster a tailored learning experience by generating targeted exercises aligned with educational science principles, such as knowledge tracing and personalized learning. Concretely, we let GPT-3 be a math tutor and run two steps iteratively: 1) assessing the student model's current learning status on a GPT-generated exercise book, and 2) improving the student model by training it with tailored exercise samples generated by GPT-3. Experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 and PaLM) in accuracy across three distinct benchmarks while employing significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the various components within our methodology to substantiate their efficacy.

**Title:** AlpacaFarm: A Simulation Framework for Methods that Learn from Human  Feedback  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14387  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have seen widespread adoption due to their ability to follow user instructions well. Developing these LLMs involves a complex yet poorly understood workflow requiring training with human feedback. Replicating and understanding this instruction-following process faces three major challenges: the high cost of data collection, the lack of trustworthy evaluation, and the absence of reference method implementations. We address these challenges with AlpacaFarm, a simulator that enables research and development for learning from feedback at a low cost. First, we design LLM prompts to simulate human feedback that are 45x cheaper than crowdworkers and display high agreement with humans. Second, we propose an automatic evaluation and validate it against human instructions obtained on real-world interactions. Third, we contribute reference implementations for several methods (PPO, best-of-n, expert iteration, and more) that learn from pairwise feedback. Finally, as an end-to-end validation of AlpacaFarm, we train and evaluate eleven models on 10k pairs of real human feedback and show that rankings of models trained in AlpacaFarm match rankings of models trained on human data. As a demonstration of the research possible in AlpacaFarm, we find that methods that use a reward model can substantially improve over supervised fine-tuning and that our reference PPO implementation leads to a +10% improvement in win-rate against Davinci003. We release all components of AlpacaFarm at https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_farm.

**Title:** Breast Cancer Segmentation using Attention-based Convolutional Network  and Explainable AI  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14389  
**Abstract:** Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant health threat, with no long-term cure currently available. Early detection is crucial, yet mammography interpretation is hindered by high false positives and negatives. With BC incidence projected to surpass lung cancer, improving early detection methods is vital. Thermography, using high-resolution infrared cameras, offers promise, especially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). This work presents an attention-based convolutional neural network for segmentation, providing increased speed and precision in BC detection and classification. The system enhances images and performs cancer segmentation with explainable AI. We propose a transformer-attention-based convolutional architecture (UNet) for fault identification and employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to analyze areas of bias and weakness in the UNet architecture with IRT images. The superiority of our proposed framework is confirmed when compared with existing deep learning frameworks.

**Title:** Prompting Language-Informed Distribution for Compositional Zero-Shot  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14428  
**Abstract:** The compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task aims to recognize unseen compositional visual concepts (i.e., sliced tomatoes), where the models are learned only from the seen compositions (i.e., sliced potatoes and red tomatoes). Thanks to the prompt tuning on large pre-trained visual language models such as CLIP, recent literature shows impressively better CZSL performance than traditional vision-based methods. However, the key aspects that impact the generalization to unseen compositions, including the diversity and informativeness of class context, and the entanglement between visual primitives (i.e., states and objects), are not properly addressed in existing CLIP-based CZSL literature. In this paper, we propose a model by prompting the language-informed distribution, aka., PLID, for the CZSL task. Specifically, the PLID leverages pre-trained large language models (LLM) to 1) formulate the language-informed class distribution, and 2) enhance the compositionality of the softly prompted class embedding. Moreover, a stochastic logit mixup strategy is proposed to dynamically fuse the decisions from the predictions in the compositional and the primitive logit space. Orthogonal to the existing literature of soft, hard, or distributional prompts, our method advocates prompting the LLM-supported class distribution that leads to a better compositional zero-shot generalization. Experimental results on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA datasets show the superior performance of the PLID to the prior arts. The code and models will be publicly released.

**Title:** Is Information Extraction Solved by ChatGPT? An Analysis of Performance,  Evaluation Criteria, Robustness and Errors  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14450  
**Abstract:** ChatGPT has stimulated the research boom in the field of large language models. In this paper, we assess the capabilities of ChatGPT from four perspectives including Performance, Evaluation Criteria, Robustness and Error Types. Specifically, we first evaluate ChatGPT's performance on 17 datasets with 14 IE sub-tasks under the zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought scenarios, and find a huge performance gap between ChatGPT and SOTA results. Next, we rethink this gap and propose a soft-matching strategy for evaluation to more accurately reflect ChatGPT's performance. Then, we analyze the robustness of ChatGPT on 14 IE sub-tasks, and find that: 1) ChatGPT rarely outputs invalid responses; 2) Irrelevant context and long-tail target types greatly affect ChatGPT's performance; 3) ChatGPT cannot understand well the subject-object relationships in RE task. Finally, we analyze the errors of ChatGPT, and find that "unannotated spans" is the most dominant error type. This raises concerns about the quality of annotated data, and indicates the possibility of annotating data with ChatGPT. The data and code are released at Github site.

**Title:** On Robustness of Finetuned Transformer-based NLP Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14453  
**Abstract:** Transformer-based pretrained models like BERT, GPT-2 and T5 have been finetuned for a large number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and have been shown to be very effective. However, while finetuning, what changes across layers in these models with respect to pretrained checkpoints is under-studied. Further, how robust are these models to perturbations in input text? Does the robustness vary depending on the NLP task for which the models have been finetuned? While there exists some work on studying robustness of BERT finetuned for a few NLP tasks, there is no rigorous study which compares this robustness across encoder only, decoder only and encoder-decoder models.

**Title:** Dancing Between Success and Failure: Edit-level Simplification  Evaluation using SALSA  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14458  
**Abstract:** Large language models (e.g., GPT-3.5) are uniquely capable of producing highly rated text simplification, yet current human evaluation methods fail to provide a clear understanding of systems' specific strengths and weaknesses. To address this limitation, we introduce SALSA, an edit-based human annotation framework that enables holistic and fine-grained text simplification evaluation. We develop twenty one linguistically grounded edit types, covering the full spectrum of success and failure across dimensions of conceptual, syntactic and lexical simplicity. Using SALSA, we collect 12K edit annotations on 700 simplifications, revealing discrepancies in the distribution of transformation approaches performed by fine-tuned models, few-shot LLMs and humans, and finding GPT-3.5 performs more quality edits than humans, but still exhibits frequent errors. Using our fine-grained annotations, we develop LENS-SALSA, a reference-free automatic simplification metric, trained to predict sentence- and word-level quality simultaneously. Additionally, we introduce word-level quality estimation for simplification and report promising baseline results. Our training material, annotation toolkit, and data are released at

**Title:** CGCE: A Chinese Generative Chat Evaluation Benchmark for General and  Financial Domains  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14471  
**Abstract:** Generative chat models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have revolutionized natural language generation (NLG) by incorporating instructions and human feedback to achieve significant performance improvements. However, the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for chat models, particularly for Chinese and domain-specific models, hinders their assessment and progress. To address this gap, we introduce the Chinese Generative Chat Evaluation (CGCE) benchmark, focusing on general and financial domains. The CGCE benchmark encompasses diverse tasks, including 200 questions in the general domain and 150 specific professional questions in the financial domain. Manual scoring evaluates factors such as accuracy, coherence, expression clarity, and completeness. The CGCE benchmark provides researchers with a standardized framework to assess and compare Chinese generative chat models, fostering advancements in NLG research.

**Title:** NAIL: Lexical Retrieval Indices with Efficient Non-Autoregressive  Decoders  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14499  
**Abstract:** Neural document rerankers are extremely effective in terms of accuracy. However, the best models require dedicated hardware for serving, which is costly and often not feasible. To avoid this serving-time requirement, we present a method of capturing up to 86% of the gains of a Transformer cross-attention model with a lexicalized scoring function that only requires 10-6% of the Transformer's FLOPs per document and can be served using commodity CPUs. When combined with a BM25 retriever, this approach matches the quality of a state-of-the art dual encoder retriever, that still requires an accelerator for query encoding. We introduce NAIL (Non-Autoregressive Indexing with Language models) as a model architecture that is compatible with recent encoder-decoder and decoder-only large language models, such as T5, GPT-3 and PaLM. This model architecture can leverage existing pre-trained checkpoints and can be fine-tuned for efficiently constructing document representations that do not require neural processing of queries.

**Title:** Deduction under Perturbed Evidence: Probing Student Simulation  Capabilities of Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14507  
**Abstract:** We explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of logical reasoning with distorted facts, which we call Deduction under Perturbed Evidence (DUPE). DUPE presents a unique challenge to LLMs since they typically rely on their parameters, which encode mostly accurate information, to reason and make inferences. However, in DUPE, LLMs must reason over manipulated or falsified evidence present in their prompts, which can result in false conclusions that are valid only under the manipulated evidence. Our goal with DUPE is to determine whether LLMs can arrive at these false conclusions and identify whether the dominant factor influencing the deduction process is the encoded data in the parameters or the manipulated evidence in the prompts. To evaluate the DUPE capabilities of LLMs, we create a DUPEd version of the StrategyQA dataset, where facts are manipulated to reverse the answer to the question. Our findings show that even the most advanced GPT models struggle to reason on manipulated facts - showcasing poor DUPE skills - with accuracy dropping by 45% compared to the original dataset. We also investigate prompt settings inspired from student simulation models, which mitigate the accuracy drop to some extent. Our findings have practical implications for understanding the performance of LLMs in real-world applications such as student simulation models that involve reasoning over inaccurate information.

**Title:** Eliminating Spurious Correlations from Pre-trained Models via Data  Mixing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14521  
**Abstract:** Machine learning models pre-trained on large datasets have achieved remarkable convergence and robustness properties. However, these models often exploit spurious correlations between certain attributes and labels, which are prevalent in the majority of examples within specific categories but are not predictive of these categories in general. The learned spurious correlations may persist even after fine-tuning on new data, which degrades models' performance on examples that do not exhibit the spurious correlation. In this work, we propose a simple and highly effective method to eliminate spurious correlations from pre-trained models. The key idea of our method is to leverage a small set of examples with spurious attributes, and balance the spurious attributes across all classes via data mixing. We theoretically confirm the effectiveness of our method, and empirically demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on various vision and NLP tasks, including eliminating spurious correlations from pre-trained ResNet50 on Waterbirds and CelebA, adversarially pre-trained ResNet50 on ImageNet, and BERT pre-trained on CivilComments.

**Title:** LLMs as Factual Reasoners: Insights from Existing Benchmarks and Beyond  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14540  
**Abstract:** With the recent appearance of LLMs in practical settings, having methods that can effectively detect factual inconsistencies is crucial to reduce the propagation of misinformation and improve trust in model outputs. When testing on existing factual consistency benchmarks, we find that a few large language models (LLMs) perform competitively on classification benchmarks for factual inconsistency detection compared to traditional non-LLM methods. However, a closer analysis reveals that most LLMs fail on more complex formulations of the task and exposes issues with existing evaluation benchmarks, affecting evaluation precision. To address this, we propose a new protocol for inconsistency detection benchmark creation and implement it in a 10-domain benchmark called SummEdits. This new benchmark is 20 times more cost-effective per sample than previous benchmarks and highly reproducible, as we estimate inter-annotator agreement at about 0.9. Most LLMs struggle on SummEdits, with performance close to random chance. The best-performing model, GPT-4, is still 8\% below estimated human performance, highlighting the gaps in LLMs' ability to reason about facts and detect inconsistencies when they occur.

**Title:** Extracting Shopping Interest-Related Product Types from the Web  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14549  
**Abstract:** Recommending a diversity of product types (PTs) is important for a good shopping experience when customers are looking for products around their high-level shopping interests (SIs) such as hiking. However, the SI-PT connection is typically absent in e-commerce product catalogs and expensive to construct manually due to the volume of potential SIs, which prevents us from establishing a recommender with easily accessible knowledge systems. To establish such connections, we propose to extract PTs from the Web pages containing hand-crafted PT recommendations for SIs. The extraction task is formulated as binary HTML node classification given the general observation that an HTML node in our target Web pages can present one and only one PT phrase. Accordingly, we introduce TrENC, which stands for Tree-Transformer Encoders for Node Classification. It improves the inter-node dependency modeling with modified attention mechanisms that preserve the long-term sibling and ancestor-descendant relations. TrENC also injects SI into node features for better semantic representation. Trained on pages regarding limited SIs, TrEnc is ready to be applied to other unobserved interests. Experiments on our manually constructed dataset, WebPT, show that TrENC outperforms the best baseline model by 2.37 F1 points in the zero-shot setup. The performance indicates the feasibility of constructing SI-PT relations and using them to power downstream applications such as search and recommendation.

**Title:** Sequence Modeling is a Robust Contender for Offline Reinforcement  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14550  
**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to learn effective, return-maximizing policies from a static dataset. Three major paradigms for offline RL are Q-Learning, Imitation Learning, and Sequence Modeling. A key open question is: which paradigm is preferred under what conditions? We study this question empirically by exploring the performance of representative algorithms -- Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and Decision Transformer (DT) -- across the commonly used D4RL and Robomimic benchmarks. We design targeted experiments to understand their behavior concerning data suboptimality and task complexity. Our key findings are: (1) Sequence Modeling requires more data than Q-Learning to learn competitive policies but is more robust; (2) Sequence Modeling is a substantially better choice than both Q-Learning and Imitation Learning in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings; and (3) Sequence Modeling and Imitation Learning are preferable as task horizon increases, or when data is obtained from suboptimal human demonstrators. Based on the overall strength of Sequence Modeling, we also investigate architectural choices and scaling trends for DT on Atari and D4RL and make design recommendations. We find that scaling the amount of data for DT by 5x gives a 2.5x average score improvement on Atari.

**Title:** Exploring Semantic Variations in GAN Latent Spaces via Matrix  Factorization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14551  
**Abstract:** Controlled data generation with GANs is desirable but challenging due to the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of their latent spaces. In this work, we explore image manipulations learned by GANSpace, a state-of-the-art method based on PCA. Through quantitative and qualitative assessments we show: (a) GANSpace produces a wide range of high-quality image manipulations, but they can be highly entangled, limiting potential use cases; (b) Replacing PCA with ICA improves the quality and disentanglement of manipulations; (c) The quality of the generated images can be sensitive to the size of GANs, but regardless of their complexity, fundamental controlling directions can be observed in their latent spaces.

**Title:** Sources of Hallucination by Large Language Models on Inference Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14552  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are claimed to be capable of Natural Language Inference (NLI), necessary for applied tasks like question answering and summarization, yet this capability is under-explored. We present a series of behavioral studies on several LLM families (LLaMA, GPT-3.5, and PaLM) which probe their behavior using controlled experiments. We establish two factors which predict much of their performance, and propose that these are major sources of hallucination in generative LLM. First, the most influential factor is memorization of the training data. We show that models falsely label NLI test samples as entailing when the hypothesis is attested in the training text, regardless of the premise. We further show that named entity IDs are used as "indices" to access the memorized data. Second, we show that LLMs exploit a further corpus-based heuristic using the relative frequencies of words. We show that LLMs score significantly worse on NLI test samples which do not conform to these factors than those which do; we also discuss a tension between the two factors, and a performance trade-off.

**Title:** All Roads Lead to Rome? Exploring the Invariance of Transformers'  Representations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14555  
**Abstract:** Transformer models bring propelling advances in various NLP tasks, thus inducing lots of interpretability research on the learned representations of the models. However, we raise a fundamental question regarding the reliability of the representations. Specifically, we investigate whether transformers learn essentially isomorphic representation spaces, or those that are sensitive to the random seeds in their pretraining process. In this work, we formulate the Bijection Hypothesis, which suggests the use of bijective methods to align different models' representation spaces. We propose a model based on invertible neural networks, BERT-INN, to learn the bijection more effectively than other existing bijective methods such as the canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We show the advantage of BERT-INN both theoretically and through extensive experiments, and apply it to align the reproduced BERT embeddings to draw insights that are meaningful to the interpretability research. Our code is at https://github.com/twinkle0331/BERT-similarity.

**Title:** Unraveling ChatGPT: A Critical Analysis of AI-Generated Goal-Oriented  Dialogues and Annotations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14556  
**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models have exhibited unprecedented capabilities in producing high-quality text via prompting techniques. This fact introduces new possibilities for data collection and annotation, particularly in situations where such data is scarce, complex to gather, expensive, or even sensitive. In this paper, we explore the potential of these models to generate and annotate goal-oriented dialogues, and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate their quality. Our experiments employ ChatGPT, and encompass three categories of goal-oriented dialogues (task-oriented, collaborative, and explanatory), two generation modes (interactive and one-shot), and two languages (English and Italian). Based on extensive human-based evaluations, we demonstrate that the quality of generated dialogues and annotations is on par with those generated by humans.

**Title:** PEARL: Prompting Large Language Models to Plan and Execute Actions Over  Long Documents  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14564  
**Abstract:** Strategies such as chain-of-thought prompting improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks by decomposing input examples into intermediate steps. However, it remains unclear how to apply such methods to reason over long input documents, in which both the decomposition and the output of each intermediate step are non-trivial to obtain. In this work, we propose PEARL, a prompting framework to improve reasoning over long documents, which consists of three stages: action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. More specifically, given a question about a long document, PEARL decomposes the question into a sequence of actions (e.g., SUMMARIZE, FIND_EVENT, FIND_RELATION) and then executes them over the document to obtain the answer. Each stage of PEARL is implemented via zero-shot or few-shot prompting of LLMs (in our work, GPT-4) with minimal human input. We evaluate PEARL on a challenging subset of the QuALITY dataset, which contains questions that require complex reasoning over long narrative texts. PEARL outperforms zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting on this dataset, and ablation experiments show that each stage of PEARL is critical to its performance. Overall, PEARL is a first step towards leveraging LLMs to reason over long documents.

**Title:** From Characters to Words: Hierarchical Pre-trained Language Model for  Open-vocabulary Language Understanding  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14571  
**Abstract:** Current state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding require a preprocessing step to convert raw text into discrete tokens. This process known as tokenization relies on a pre-built vocabulary of words or sub-word morphemes. This fixed vocabulary limits the model's robustness to spelling errors and its capacity to adapt to new domains. In this work, we introduce a novel open-vocabulary language model that adopts a hierarchical two-level approach: one at the word level and another at the sequence level. Concretely, we design an intra-word module that uses a shallow Transformer architecture to learn word representations from their characters, and a deep inter-word Transformer module that contextualizes each word representation by attending to the entire word sequence. Our model thus directly operates on character sequences with explicit awareness of word boundaries, but without biased sub-word or word-level vocabulary. Experiments on various downstream tasks show that our method outperforms strong baselines. We also demonstrate that our hierarchical model is robust to textual corruption and domain shift.

**Title:** Connecting the Dots: What Graph-Based Text Representations Work Best for  Text Classification using Graph Neural Networks?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14578  
**Abstract:** Given the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for structure-aware machine learning, numerous studies have explored their application to text classification, as an alternative to traditional feature representation models. However, most studies considered just a specific domain and validated on data with particular characteristics. This work presents an extensive empirical investigation of graph-based text representation methods proposed for text classification, identifying practical implications and open challenges in the field. We compare several GNN architectures as well as BERT across five datasets, encompassing short and also long documents. The results show that: i) graph performance is highly related to the textual input features and domain, ii) despite its outstanding performance, BERT has difficulties converging when dealing with short texts, iii) graph methods are particularly beneficial for longer documents.

**Title:** ALGO: Synthesizing Algorithmic Programs with Generated Oracle Verifiers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14591  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at implementing code from functionality descriptions, but struggle with algorithmic problems that require not only implementation but also identification of the suitable algorithm. Moreover, LLM-generated programs lack guaranteed correctness and require human verification. To address these challenges, we propose ALGO, a framework that synthesizes Algorithmic programs with LLM-Generated Oracles to guide the creation and verify their correctness. ALGO first generates a probably correct but possibly slow reference oracle by prompting an LLM to exhaustively enumerate all the combinations of relevant variables. This oracle is then utilized to guide an arbitrary search strategy in exploring the algorithm space and to verify the algorithms synthesized. Our study shows that the LLM-generated oracles are correct for 88% of the cases. With the oracles as verifiers, ALGO can be integrated with any existing code generation model in a model-agnostic manner to enhance its performance. Experiments show that when equipped with ALGO, we achieve an 8x better one-submission pass rate over the Codex model and a 2.6x better one-submission pass rate over CodeT, the current state-of-the-art model on CodeContests. We can also get 1.3x better pass rate over the ChatGPT Code Interpreter on unseen problems.

**Title:** Self-Checker: Plug-and-Play Modules for Fact-Checking with Large  Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14623  
**Abstract:** Fact-checking is an essential task in NLP that is commonly utilized for validating the factual accuracy of claims. Prior work has mainly focused on fine-tuning pre-trained languages models on specific datasets, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-3, researchers are now exploring their in-context learning capabilities for a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we aim to assess the capacity of LLMs for fact-checking by introducing Self-Checker, a framework comprising a set of plug-and-play modules that facilitate fact-checking by purely prompting LLMs in an almost zero-shot setting. This framework provides a fast and efficient way to construct fact-checking systems in low-resource environments. Empirical results demonstrate the potential of Self-Checker in utilizing LLMs for fact-checking. However, there is still significant room for improvement compared to SOTA fine-tuned models, which suggests that LLM adoption could be a promising approach for future fact-checking research.

**Title:** KNN-LM Does Not Improve Open-ended Text Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14625  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the generation quality of interpolation-based retrieval-augmented language models (LMs). These methods, best exemplified by the KNN-LM, interpolate the LM's predicted distribution of the next word with a distribution formed from the most relevant retrievals for a given prefix. While the KNN-LM and related methods yield impressive decreases in perplexity, we discover that they do not exhibit corresponding improvements in open-ended generation quality, as measured by both automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., MAUVE) and human evaluations. Digging deeper, we find that interpolating with a retrieval distribution actually increases perplexity compared to a baseline Transformer LM for the majority of tokens in the WikiText-103 test set, even though the overall perplexity is lower due to a smaller number of tokens for which perplexity dramatically decreases after interpolation. However, when decoding a long sequence at inference time, significant improvements on this smaller subset of tokens are washed out by slightly worse predictions on most tokens. Furthermore, we discover that the entropy of the retrieval distribution increases faster than that of the base LM as the generated sequence becomes longer, which indicates that retrieval is less reliable when using model-generated text as queries (i.e., is subject to exposure bias). We hope that our analysis spurs future work on improved decoding algorithms and interpolation strategies for retrieval-augmented language models.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven extraordinary improvements in NLP. However, it is unclear how such models represent lexical concepts-i.e., the meanings of the words they use. This paper evaluates the lexical representations of GPT-3 and GPT-4 through the lens of HIPE theory, a theory of concept representations which focuses on representations of words describing artifacts (such as "mop", "pencil", and "whistle"). The theory posits a causal graph that relates the meanings of such words to the form, use, and history of the objects to which they refer. We test LLMs using the same stimuli originally used by Chaigneau et al. (2004) to evaluate the theory in humans, and consider a variety of prompt designs. Our experiments concern judgements about causal outcomes, object function, and object naming. We find no evidence that GPT-3 encodes the causal structure hypothesized by HIPE, but do find evidence that GPT-4 encodes such structure. The results contribute to a growing body of research characterizing the representational capacity of large language models.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14637  
**Abstract:** Automated HTML/CSS code generation from screenshots is an important yet challenging problem with broad applications in website development and design. In this paper, we present a novel vision-code transformer approach that leverages an Encoder-Decoder architecture as well as explore actor-critic fine-tuning as a method for improving upon the baseline. For this purpose, two image encoders are compared: Vision Transformer (ViT) and Document Image Transformer (DiT).

**Title:** A Joint Time-frequency Domain Transformer for Multivariate Time Series  Forecasting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14649  
**Abstract:** To enhance predicting performance while minimizing computational demands, this paper introduces a joint time-frequency domain Transformer (JTFT) for multivariate forecasting. The method exploits the sparsity of time series in the frequency domain using a small number of learnable frequencies to extract temporal dependencies effectively. Alongside the frequency domain representation, a fixed number of the most recent data points are directly encoded in the time domain, bolstering the learning of local relationships and mitigating the adverse effects of non-stationarity. JTFT achieves linear complexity since the length of the internal representation remains independent of the input sequence length. Additionally, a low-rank attention layer is proposed to efficiently capture cross-dimensional dependencies and prevent performance degradation due to the entanglement of temporal and channel-wise modeling. Experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that JTFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

**Title:** Revisit and Outstrip Entity Alignment: A Perspective of Generative  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14651  
**Abstract:** Recent embedding-based methods have achieved great successes on exploiting entity alignment from knowledge graph (KG) embeddings of multiple modals. In this paper, we study embedding-based entity alignment (EEA) from a perspective of generative models. We show that EEA is a special problem where the main objective is analogous to that in a typical generative model, based on which we theoretically prove the effectiveness of the recently developed generative adversarial network (GAN)-based EEA methods. We then reveal that their incomplete objective limits the capacity on both entity alignment and entity synthesis (i.e., generating new entities). We mitigate this problem by introducing a generative EEA (abbr., GEEA) framework with the proposed mutual variational autoencoder (M-VAE) as the generative model. M-VAE can convert an entity from one KG to another and generate new entities from random noise vectors. We demonstrate the power of GEEA with theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on both entity alignment and entity synthesis tasks.

**Title:** Barkour: Benchmarking Animal-level Agility with Quadruped Robots  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14654  
**Abstract:** Animals have evolved various agile locomotion strategies, such as sprinting, leaping, and jumping. There is a growing interest in developing legged robots that move like their biological counterparts and show various agile skills to navigate complex environments quickly. Despite the interest, the field lacks systematic benchmarks to measure the performance of control policies and hardware in agility. We introduce the Barkour benchmark, an obstacle course to quantify agility for legged robots. Inspired by dog agility competitions, it consists of diverse obstacles and a time based scoring mechanism. This encourages researchers to develop controllers that not only move fast, but do so in a controllable and versatile way. To set strong baselines, we present two methods for tackling the benchmark. In the first approach, we train specialist locomotion skills using on-policy reinforcement learning methods and combine them with a high-level navigation controller. In the second approach, we distill the specialist skills into a Transformer-based generalist locomotion policy, named Locomotion-Transformer, that can handle various terrains and adjust the robot's gait based on the perceived environment and robot states. Using a custom-built quadruped robot, we demonstrate that our method can complete the course at half the speed of a dog. We hope that our work represents a step towards creating controllers that enable robots to reach animal-level agility.

**Title:** Evaluate What You Can't Evaluate: Unassessable Generated Responses  Quality  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14658  
**Abstract:** LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities. Although reference-free evaluators based on LLMs show better human alignment than traditional reference-based evaluators, there are many challenges in using reference-free evaluators based on LLMs. Reference-free evaluators are more suitable for open-ended examples with different semantics responses. But not all examples are open-ended. For closed-ended examples with unique correct semantic response, reference-free evaluators will still consider it high quality when giving a response that is inconsistent with the facts and the semantic of reference. In order to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of evaluators based on LLMs, we construct two adversarial meta-evaluation dialogue generation datasets KdConv-ADV and DSTC7-ADV based on KdConv and DSTC7-AVSD, respectively. Compared to previous meta-evaluation benchmarks, KdConv-ADV and DSTC7-ADV are much more challenging since they requires evaluators to be able to reasonably evaluate closed-ended examples with the help of external knowledge or even its own knowledge. Empirical results show that the ability of LLMs to identify unreasonable responses is insufficient. There are risks in using eference-free evaluators based on LLMs to evaluate the quality of dialogue responses.

**Title:** Diffusion Models in NLP: A Survey  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14671  
**Abstract:** This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the use of diffusion models in natural language processing (NLP). Diffusion models are a class of mathematical models that aim to capture the diffusion of information or signals across a network or manifold. In NLP, diffusion models have been used in a variety of applications, such as natural language generation, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and machine translation. This paper discusses the different formulations of diffusion models used in NLP, their strengths and limitations, and their applications. We also perform a thorough comparison between diffusion models and alternative generative models, specifically highlighting the autoregressive (AR) models, while also examining how diverse architectures incorporate the Transformer in conjunction with diffusion models. Compared to AR models, diffusion models have significant advantages for parallel generation, text interpolation, token-level controls such as syntactic structures and semantic contents, and robustness. Exploring further permutations of integrating Transformers into diffusion models would be a valuable pursuit. Also, the development of multimodal diffusion models and large-scale diffusion language models with notable capabilities for few-shot learning would be important directions for the future advance of diffusion models in NLP.

**Title:** T1: Scaling Diffusion Probabilistic Fields to High-Resolution on Unified  Visual Modalities  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14674  
**Abstract:** Diffusion Probabilistic Field (DPF) models the distribution of continuous functions defined over metric spaces. While DPF shows great potential for unifying data generation of various modalities including images, videos, and 3D geometry, it does not scale to a higher data resolution. This can be attributed to the ``scaling property'', where it is difficult for the model to capture local structures through uniform sampling. To this end, we propose a new model comprising of a view-wise sampling algorithm to focus on local structure learning, and incorporating additional guidance, e.g., text description, to complement the global geometry. The model can be scaled to generate high-resolution data while unifying multiple modalities. Experimental results on data generation in various modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, as well as its potential as a foundation framework for scalable modality-unified visual content generation.

**Title:** Revenge of MLP in Sequential Recommendation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14675  
**Abstract:** Sequential recommendation models sequences of historical user-item interactive behaviors (or referred as token) to better infer dynamic preferences. Fueled by the improved neural network architectures such as RNN, CNN and Transformer, this field has enjoyed rapid performance boost in the past years. Recent progress on all-MLP models lights on an efficient method with less intensive computation, token-mixing MLP, to learn the transformation patterns among historical behaviors. However, due to the inherent fully-connection design that allows the unrestricted cross-token communication and ignores the chronological order, we find that directly applying token-mixing MLP into sequential recommendation leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we present a purely MLP-based sequential recommendation architecture TriMLP with a novel \underline{Tri}angular Mixer where the modified \underline{MLP} endows tokens with ordered interactions. As the cross-token interaction in MLP is actually matrix multiplication, Triangular Mixer drops the lower-triangle neurons in the weight matrix and thus blocks the connections from future tokens, which prevents information leakage and improves prediction capability under the standard auto-regressive training fashion. To further model long and short-term preferences on fine-grained level, the mixer adopts a dual-branch structure based on the delicate MLP described above, namely global and local mixing, to separately capture the sequential long-range dependencies and local patterns. Empirical study on 9 different scale datasets (contain 50K\textasciitilde20M behaviors) of various benchmarks, including MovieLens, Amazon and Tenrec, demonstrates that TriMLP attains promising and stable accuracy/efficiency trade-off, i.e., averagely surpasses several state-of-the-art baselines by 5.32\% and saves 8.44\% inference time cost.

**Title:** Optimal Linear Subspace Search: Learning to Construct Fast and  High-Quality Schedulers for Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14677  
**Abstract:** In recent years, diffusion models have become the most popular and powerful methods in the field of image synthesis, even rivaling human artists in artistic creativity. However, the key issue currently limiting the application of diffusion models is its extremely slow generation process. Although several methods were proposed to speed up the generation process, there still exists a trade-off between efficiency and quality. In this paper, we first provide a detailed theoretical and empirical analysis of the generation process of the diffusion models based on schedulers. We transform the designing problem of schedulers into the determination of several parameters, and further transform the accelerated generation process into an expansion process of the linear subspace. Based on these analyses, we consequently propose a novel method called Optimal Linear Subspace Search (OLSS), which accelerates the generation process by searching for the optimal approximation process of the complete generation process in the linear subspaces spanned by latent variables. OLSS is able to generate high-quality images with a very small number of steps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive comparative experiments on open-source diffusion models. Experimental results show that with a given number of steps, OLSS can significantly improve the quality of generated images. Using an NVIDIA A100 GPU, we make it possible to generate a high-quality image by Stable Diffusion within only one second without other optimization techniques.

**Title:** ExpertPrompting: Instructing Large Language Models to be Distinguished  Experts  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14688  
**Abstract:** The answering quality of an aligned large language model (LLM) can be drastically improved if treated with proper crafting of prompts. In this paper, we propose ExpertPrompting to elicit the potential of LLMs to answer as distinguished experts. We first utilize In-Context Learning to automatically synthesize detailed and customized descriptions of the expert identity for each specific instruction, and then ask LLMs to provide answer conditioned on such agent background. Based on this augmented prompting strategy, we produce a new set of instruction-following data using GPT-3.5, and train a competitive open-source chat assistant called ExpertLLaMA. We employ GPT4-based evaluation to show that 1) the expert data is of significantly higher quality than vanilla answers, and 2) ExpertLLaMA outperforms existing open-source opponents and achieves 96\% of the original ChatGPT's capability. All data and the ExpertLLaMA model will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/OFA-Sys/ExpertLLaMA}.

**Title:** A Causal View of Entity Bias in (Large) Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14695  
**Abstract:** Entity bias widely affects pretrained (large) language models, causing them to excessively rely on (biased) parametric knowledge to make unfaithful predictions. Although causality-inspired methods have shown great potential to mitigate entity bias, it is hard to precisely estimate the parameters of underlying causal models in practice. The rise of black-box LLMs also makes the situation even worse, because of their inaccessible parameters and uncalibrated logits. To address these problems, we propose a specific structured causal model (SCM) whose parameters are comparatively easier to estimate. Building upon this SCM, we propose causal intervention techniques to mitigate entity bias for both white-box and black-box settings. The proposed causal intervention perturbs the original entity with neighboring entities. This intervention reduces specific biasing information pertaining to the original entity while still preserving sufficient common predictive information from similar entities. When evaluated on the relation extraction task, our training-time intervention significantly improves the F1 score of RoBERTa by 5.7 points on EntRED, in which spurious shortcuts between entities and labels are removed. Meanwhile, our in-context intervention effectively reduces the knowledge conflicts between parametric knowledge and contextual knowledge in GPT-3.5 and improves the F1 score by 9.14 points on a challenging test set derived from Re-TACRED.

**Title:** Can Transformers Learn to Solve Problems Recursively?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14699  
**Abstract:** Neural networks have in recent years shown promise for helping software engineers write programs and even formally verify them. While semantic information plays a crucial part in these processes, it remains unclear to what degree popular neural architectures like transformers are capable of modeling that information. This paper examines the behavior of neural networks learning algorithms relevant to programs and formal verification proofs through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, focusing in particular on structural recursion. Structural recursion is at the heart of tasks on which symbolic tools currently outperform neural models, like inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior. We evaluate the ability of transformer models to learn to emulate the behavior of structurally recursive functions from input-output examples. Our evaluation includes empirical and conceptual analyses of the limitations and capabilities of transformer models in approximating these functions, as well as reconstructions of the ``shortcut" algorithms the model learns. By reconstructing these algorithms, we are able to correctly predict 91 percent of failure cases for one of the approximated functions. Our work provides a new foundation for understanding the behavior of neural networks that fail to solve the very tasks they are trained for.

**Title:** Analyzing Influential Factors in Human Preference Judgments via GPT-4  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14702  
**Abstract:** Pairwise human judgments are pivotal in guiding large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs that align with human preferences. They are also often used in summarization evaluation, complementing existing automatic metrics. Despite their significance, however, there has been limited research probing these pairwise human judgments. The collective impact and respective weights of factors such as informativeness, coherence, fluency, and factual consistency remain elusive. The impact of hidden factors on the final judgment is also unclear. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth examination of a dataset of pairwise human judgments released by OpenAI. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, we identify key factors that could potentially influence human judgments. Our research uncovers the inherent preferences embedded in human judgments and suggests strategies to boost sample efficiency. Finally, we provide insights on the construction of balanced datasets for human judgment evaluations, a crucial step in shaping the behaviors of future LLMs.

**Title:** Generative diffusion learning for parametric partial differential  equations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14703  
**Abstract:** We develop a class of data-driven generative models that approximate the solution operator for parameter-dependent partial differential equations (PDE). We propose a novel probabilistic formulation of the operator learning problem based on recently developed generative denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) in order to learn the input-to-output mapping between problem parameters and solutions of the PDE. To achieve this goal we modify DDPM to supervised learning in which the solution operator for the PDE is represented by a class of conditional distributions. The probabilistic formulation combined with DDPM allows for an automatic quantification of confidence intervals for the learned solutions. Furthermore, the framework is directly applicable for learning from a noisy data set. We compare computational performance of the developed method with the Fourier Network Operators (FNO). Our results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy and recovers the noise magnitude when applied to data sets with outputs corrupted by additive noise.

**Title:** PruMUX: Augmenting Data Multiplexing with Model Compression  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14706  
**Abstract:** As language models increase in size by the day, methods for efficient inference are critical to leveraging their capabilities for various applications. Prior work has investigated techniques like model pruning, knowledge distillation, and data multiplexing to increase model throughput without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we combine two such methods -- structured pruning and data multiplexing -- to compound the speedup gains obtained by either method. Our approach, PruMUX, obtains up to 7.5-29.5X throughput improvement over BERT-base model with accuracy threshold from 80% to 74%. We further study various combinations of parameters (such as sparsity and multiplexing factor) in the two techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the tradeoff between accuracy and throughput in the resulting models. We then propose Auto-PruMUX, a meta-level model that can predict the high-performance parameters for pruning and multiplexing given a desired accuracy loss budget, providing a practical method to leverage the combination effectively.

**Title:** The student becomes the master: Matching GPT3 on Scientific Factual  Error Correction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14707  
**Abstract:** Due to the prohibitively high cost of creating error correction datasets, most Factual Claim Correction methods rely on a powerful verification model to guide the correction process. This leads to a significant drop in performance in domains like Scientific Claim Correction, where good verification models do not always exist. In this work, we introduce a claim correction system that makes no domain assumptions and does not require a verifier but is able to outperform existing methods by an order of magnitude -- achieving 94% correction accuracy on the SciFact dataset, and 62.5% on the SciFact-Open dataset, compared to the next best methods 0.5% and 1.50% respectively. Our method leverages the power of prompting with LLMs during training to create a richly annotated dataset that can be used for fully supervised training and regularization. We additionally use a claim-aware decoding procedure to improve the quality of corrected claims. Our method is competitive with the very LLM that was used to generate the annotated dataset -- with GPT3.5 achieving 89.5% and 60% correction accuracy on SciFact and SciFact-Open, despite using 1250 times as many parameters as our model.

**Title:** On the Generalization of Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14712  
**Abstract:** The diffusion probabilistic generative models are widely used to generate high-quality data. Though they can synthetic data that does not exist in the training set, the rationale behind such generalization is still unexplored. In this paper, we formally define the generalization of the generative model, which is measured by the mutual information between the generated data and the training set. The definition originates from the intuition that the model which generates data with less correlation to the training set exhibits better generalization ability. Meanwhile, we show that for the empirical optimal diffusion model, the data generated by a deterministic sampler are all highly related to the training set, thus poor generalization. This result contradicts the observation of the trained diffusion model's (approximating empirical optima) extrapolation ability (generating unseen data). To understand this contradiction, we empirically verify the difference between the sufficiently trained diffusion model and the empirical optima. We found, though obtained through sufficient training, there still exists a slight difference between them, which is critical to making the diffusion model generalizable. Moreover, we propose another training objective whose empirical optimal solution has no potential generalization problem. We empirically show that the proposed training objective returns a similar model to the original one, which further verifies the generalization ability of the trained diffusion model.

**Title:** BLIP-Diffusion: Pre-trained Subject Representation for Controllable  Text-to-Image Generation and Editing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14720  
**Abstract:** Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip-diffusion. Project page at https://dxli94.github.io/BLIP-Diffusion-website/.

**Title:** I Spy a Metaphor: Large Language Models and Diffusion Models Co-Create  Visual Metaphors  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14724  
**Abstract:** Visual metaphors are powerful rhetorical devices used to persuade or communicate creative ideas through images. Similar to linguistic metaphors, they convey meaning implicitly through symbolism and juxtaposition of the symbols. We propose a new task of generating visual metaphors from linguistic metaphors. This is a challenging task for diffusion-based text-to-image models, such as DALL$\cdot$E 2, since it requires the ability to model implicit meaning and compositionality. We propose to solve the task through the collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models: Instruct GPT-3 (davinci-002) with Chain-of-Thought prompting generates text that represents a visual elaboration of the linguistic metaphor containing the implicit meaning and relevant objects, which is then used as input to the diffusion-based text-to-image models.Using a human-AI collaboration framework, where humans interact both with the LLM and the top-performing diffusion model, we create a high-quality dataset containing 6,476 visual metaphors for 1,540 linguistic metaphors and their associated visual elaborations. Evaluation by professional illustrators shows the promise of LLM-Diffusion Model collaboration for this task.To evaluate the utility of our Human-AI collaboration framework and the quality of our dataset, we perform both an intrinsic human-based evaluation and an extrinsic evaluation using visual entailment as a downstream task.

**Title:** Advancements in Arabic Grammatical Error Detection and Correction: An  Empirical Investigation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14734  
**Abstract:** Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a well-explored problem in English with many existing models and datasets. However, research on GEC in morphologically rich languages has been limited due to challenges such as data scarcity and language complexity. In this paper, we present the first results on Arabic GEC by using two newly developed Transformer-based pretrained sequence-to-sequence models. We address the task of multi-class Arabic grammatical error detection (GED) and present the first results on multi-class Arabic GED. We show that using GED information as auxiliary input in GEC models improves GEC performance across three datasets spanning different genres. Moreover, we also investigate the use of contextual morphological preprocessing in aiding GEC systems. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on two Arabic GEC shared tasks datasets and establish a strong benchmark on a newly created dataset.

**Title:** Trusting Your Evidence: Hallucinate Less with Context-aware Decoding  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14739  
**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) often struggle to pay enough attention to the input context, and generate texts that are unfaithful or contain hallucinations. To mitigate this issue, we present context-aware decoding (CAD), which follows a contrastive output distribution that amplifies the difference between the output probabilities when a model is used with and without context. Our experiments show that CAD, without additional training, significantly improves the faithfulness of different LM families, including OPT, GPT, LLaMA and FLAN-T5 for summarization tasks (e.g., 14.3% gain for LLaMA in factuality metrics). Furthermore, CAD is particularly effective in overriding a model's prior knowledge when it contradicts the provided context, leading to substantial improvements in tasks where resolving the knowledge conflict is essential.

**Title:** ChatFace: Chat-Guided Real Face Editing via Diffusion Latent Space  Manipulation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14742  
**Abstract:** Editing real facial images is a crucial task in computer vision with significant demand in various real-world applications. While GAN-based methods have showed potential in manipulating images especially when combined with CLIP, these methods are limited in their ability to reconstruct real images due to challenging GAN inversion capability. Despite the successful image reconstruction achieved by diffusion-based methods, there are still challenges in effectively manipulating fine-gained facial attributes with textual instructions.To address these issues and facilitate convenient manipulation of real facial images, we propose a novel approach that conduct text-driven image editing in the semantic latent space of diffusion model. By aligning the temporal feature of the diffusion model with the semantic condition at generative process, we introduce a stable manipulation strategy, which perform precise zero-shot manipulation effectively. Furthermore, we develop an interactive system named ChatFace, which combines the zero-shot reasoning ability of large language models to perform efficient manipulations in diffusion semantic latent space. This system enables users to perform complex multi-attribute manipulations through dialogue, opening up new possibilities for interactive image editing. Extensive experiments confirmed that our approach outperforms previous methods and enables precise editing of real facial images, making it a promising candidate for real-world applications.

**Title:** Mastering the ABCDs of Complex Questions: Answer-Based Claim  Decomposition for Fine-grained Self-Evaluation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14750  
**Abstract:** When answering complex questions, large language models (LLMs) may produce answers that do not satisfy all criteria of the question. While existing self-evaluation techniques aim to detect if such answers are correct, these techniques are unable to determine which criteria of the question are satisfied by the generated answers. To address this issue, we propose answer-based claim decomposition (ABCD), a prompting strategy that decomposes questions into a series of true/false claims that can be used to verify which criteria of the input question an answer satisfies. Using the decomposed ABCD claims, we perform fine-grained self-evaluation. Through preliminary experiments on three datasets, including a newly-collected challenge dataset ObscureQA, we find that GPT-3.5 has some ability to determine to what extent its answer satisfies the criteria of the input question, and can give insights into the errors and knowledge gaps of the model.

**Title:** A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large  Language Models and Formal Verification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14752  
**Abstract:** In this paper we present a novel solution that combines the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Formal Verification strategies to verify and automatically repair software vulnerabilities. Initially, we employ Bounded Model Checking (BMC) to locate the software vulnerability and derive a counterexample. The counterexample provides evidence that the system behaves incorrectly or contains a vulnerability. The counterexample that has been detected, along with the source code, are provided to the LLM engine. Our approach involves establishing a specialized prompt language for conducting code debugging and generation to understand the vulnerability's root cause and repair the code. Finally, we use BMC to verify the corrected version of the code generated by the LLM. As a proof of concept, we create ESBMC-AI based on the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC) and a pre-trained Transformer model, specifically gpt-3.5-turbo, to detect and fix errors in C programs. Our experimentation involved generating a dataset comprising 1000 C code samples, each consisting of 20 to 50 lines of code. Notably, our proposed method achieved an impressive success rate of up to 80% in repairing vulnerable code encompassing buffer overflow and pointer dereference failures. We assert that this automated approach can effectively incorporate into the software development lifecycle's continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process.

**Title:** Don't Take This Out of Context! On the Need for Contextual Models and  Evaluations for Stylistic Rewriting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14755  
**Abstract:** Most existing stylistic text rewriting methods operate on a sentence level, but ignoring the broader context of the text can lead to generic, ambiguous, and incoherent rewrites. In this paper, we propose the integration of preceding textual context into both the rewriting and evaluation stages of stylistic text rewriting, focusing on formality, toxicity, and sentiment transfer tasks. We conduct a comparative evaluation of rewriting through few-shot prompting of GPT-3.5 and GPT NeoX, comparing non-contextual rewrites to contextual rewrites. Our experiments show that humans often prefer contextual rewrites over non-contextual ones, but automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU, sBERT) do not. To bridge this gap, we propose context-infused versions of common automatic metrics, and show that these better reflect human preferences. Overall, our paper highlights the importance of integrating preceding textual context into both the rewriting and evaluation stages of stylistic text rewriting.

**Title:** Human-Centered Metrics for Dialog System Evaluation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14757  
**Abstract:** We present metrics for evaluating dialog systems through a psychologically-grounded "human" lens: conversational agents express a diversity of both states (short-term factors like emotions) and traits (longer-term factors like personality) just as people do. These interpretable metrics consist of five measures from established psychology constructs that can be applied both across dialogs and on turns within dialogs: emotional entropy, linguistic style and emotion matching, as well as agreeableness and empathy. We compare these human metrics against 6 state-of-the-art automatic metrics (e.g. BARTScore and BLEURT) on 7 standard dialog system data sets. We also introduce a novel data set, the Three Bot Dialog Evaluation Corpus, which consists of annotated conversations from ChatGPT, GPT-3, and BlenderBot. We demonstrate the proposed human metrics offer novel information, are uncorrelated with automatic metrics, and lead to increased accuracy beyond existing automatic metrics for predicting crowd-sourced dialog judgements. The interpretability and unique signal of our proposed human-centered framework make it a valuable tool for evaluating and improving dialog systems.

**Title:** Clever Hans or Neural Theory of Mind? Stress Testing Social Reasoning in  Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14763  
**Abstract:** The escalating debate on AI's capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine "intelligence". Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models.

**Title:** Dual Path Transformer with Partition Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14768  
**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism, called dual attention, which is both efficient and effective. The dual attention mechanism consists of two parallel components: local attention generated by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and long-range attention generated by Vision Transformers (ViTs). To address the high computational complexity and memory footprint of vanilla Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), we introduce a novel Multi-Head Partition-wise Attention (MHPA) mechanism. The partition-wise attention approach models both intra-partition and inter-partition attention simultaneously. Building on the dual attention block and partition-wise attention mechanism, we present a hierarchical vision backbone called DualFormer. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on several computer vision tasks, including image classification on ImageNet, object detection on COCO, and semantic segmentation on Cityscapes. Specifically, the proposed DualFormer-XS achieves 81.5\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming the recent state-of-the-art MPViT-XS by 0.6\% top-1 accuracy with much higher throughput.

**Title:** SSD-2: Scaling and Inference-time Fusion of Diffusion Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14771  
**Abstract:** Diffusion-based language models (LMs) have been shown to be competent generative models that are easy to control at inference and are a promising alternative to autoregressive LMs. While autoregressive LMs have benefited immensely from scaling and instruction-based learning, existing studies on diffusion LMs have been conducted on a relatively smaller scale. Starting with a recently proposed diffusion model SSD-LM, in this work we explore methods to scale it from 0.4B to 13B parameters, proposing several techniques to improve its training and inference efficiency. We call the new model SSD-2. We further show that this model can be easily finetuned to follow instructions. Finally, leveraging diffusion models' capability at inference-time control, we show that SSD-2 facilitates novel ensembles with 100x smaller models that can be customized and deployed by individual users. We find that compared to autoregressive models, the collaboration between diffusion models is more effective, leading to higher-quality and more relevant model responses due to their ability to incorporate bi-directional contexts.

**Title:** Text Conditional Alt-Text Generation for Twitter Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14779  
**Abstract:** In this work we present an approach for generating alternative text (or alt-text) descriptions for images shared on social media, specifically Twitter. This task is more than just a special case of image captioning, as alt-text is both more literally descriptive and context-specific. Also critically, images posted to Twitter are often accompanied by user-written text that despite not necessarily describing the image may provide useful context that if properly leveraged can be informative -- e.g. the tweet may name an uncommon object in the image that the model has not previously seen. We address this with a CLIP prefix model that extracts an embedding of the image and passes it to a mapping network that outputs a short sequence in word embedding space, or a ``prefix'', to which we also concatenate the text from the tweet itself. This lets the model condition on both visual and textual information from the post. The combined multimodal prefix is then fed as a prompt to a pretrained language model which autoregressively completes the sequence to generate the alt-text. While prior work has used similar methods for captioning, ours is the first to our knowledge that incorporates textual information from the associated social media post into the prefix as well, and we further demonstrate through ablations that utility of these two information sources stacks. We put forward a new dataset scraped from Twitter and evaluate on it across a variety of automated metrics as well as human evaluation, and show that our approach of conditioning on both tweet text and visual information significantly outperforms prior work.

**Title:** ChatGPT and Simple Linguistic Inferences: Blind Spots and Blinds  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14785  
**Abstract:** This paper sheds light on the limitations of ChatGPT's understanding capabilities, focusing on simple inference tasks that are typically easy for humans but appear to be challenging for the model. Specifically, we target (i) grammatically-specified entailments, (ii) premises with evidential adverbs of uncertainty, and (iii) monotonicity entailments. We present expert-designed evaluation sets for these inference types and conduct experiments in a zero-shot setup. Our results show that the model struggles with these types of inferences, exhibiting moderate to low accuracy. Moreover, while ChatGPT demonstrates knowledge of the underlying linguistic concepts when prompted directly, it often fails to incorporate this knowledge to make correct inferences. Even more strikingly, further experiments show that embedding the premise under presupposition triggers or non-factive verbs causes the model to predict entailment more frequently {regardless} of the correct semantic label. Overall these results suggest that, despite GPT's celebrated language understanding capacity, ChatGPT has blindspots with respect to certain types of entailment, and that certain entailment-cancelling features act as ``blinds'' overshadowing the semantics of the embedded premise. Our analyses emphasize the need for further research into the linguistic comprehension and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, in order to improve their reliability, and establish their trustworthiness for real-world applications.

**Title:** Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14788  
**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.

**Title:** Semi-Supervised and Long-Tailed Object Detection with CascadeMatch  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14813  
**Abstract:** This paper focuses on long-tailed object detection in the semi-supervised learning setting, which poses realistic challenges, but has rarely been studied in the literature. We propose a novel pseudo-labeling-based detector called CascadeMatch. Our detector features a cascade network architecture, which has multi-stage detection heads with progressive confidence thresholds. To avoid manually tuning the thresholds, we design a new adaptive pseudo-label mining mechanism to automatically identify suitable values from data. To mitigate confirmation bias, where a model is negatively reinforced by incorrect pseudo-labels produced by itself, each detection head is trained by the ensemble pseudo-labels of all detection heads. Experiments on two long-tailed datasets, i.e., LVIS and COCO-LT, demonstrate that CascadeMatch surpasses existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches -- across a wide range of detection architectures -- in handling long-tailed object detection. For instance, CascadeMatch outperforms Unbiased Teacher by 1.9 AP Fix on LVIS when using a ResNet50-based Cascade R-CNN structure, and by 1.7 AP Fix when using Sparse R-CNN with a Transformer encoder. We also show that CascadeMatch can even handle the challenging sparsely annotated object detection problem.

**Title:** OD-NeRF: Efficient Training of On-the-Fly Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14831  
**Abstract:** Dynamic neural radiance fields (dynamic NeRFs) have demonstrated impressive results in novel view synthesis on 3D dynamic scenes. However, they often require complete video sequences for training followed by novel view synthesis, which is similar to playing back the recording of a dynamic 3D scene. In contrast, we propose OD-NeRF to efficiently train and render dynamic NeRFs on-the-fly which instead is capable of streaming the dynamic scene. When training on-the-fly, the training frames become available sequentially and the model is trained and rendered frame-by-frame. The key challenge of efficient on-the-fly training is how to utilize the radiance field estimated from the previous frames effectively. To tackle this challenge, we propose: 1) a NeRF model conditioned on the multi-view projected colors to implicitly track correspondence between the current and previous frames, and 2) a transition and update algorithm that leverages the occupancy grid from the last frame to sample efficiently at the current frame. Our algorithm can achieve an interactive speed of 6FPS training and rendering on synthetic dynamic scenes on-the-fly, and a significant speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art on real-world dynamic scenes.

**Title:** SummIt: Iterative Text Summarization via ChatGPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14835  
**Abstract:** Existing text summarization systems have made significant progress in recent years but typically generates summaries in a single step. The one-shot summarization setting is sometimes inadequate, however, as the generated summary may contain hallucinations or overlook important details related to the reader's interests. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing SummIt, an iterative text summarization framework based on large language models like ChatGPT. Our framework enables the model to refine the generated summary iteratively through self-evaluation and feedback, closely resembling the iterative process humans undertake when drafting and revising summaries. We also explore using in-context learning to guide the rationale generation and summary refinement. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating knowledge and topic extractors into the framework to enhance summary faithfulness and controllability. We evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark summarization datasets through empirical and qualitative analyses. We also conduct a human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the model's refinements and find a potential issue of over-correction. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/hpzhang94/summ_it}.

**Title:** Predicting Token Impact Towards Efficient Vision Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14840  
**Abstract:** Token filtering to reduce irrelevant tokens prior to self-attention is a straightforward way to enable efficient vision Transformer. This is the first work to view token filtering from a feature selection perspective, where we weigh the importance of a token according to how much it can change the loss once masked. If the loss changes greatly after masking a token of interest, it means that such a token has a significant impact on the final decision and is thus relevant. Otherwise, the token is less important for the final decision, so it can be filtered out. After applying the token filtering module generalized from the whole training data, the token number fed to the self-attention module can be obviously reduced in the inference phase, leading to much fewer computations in all the subsequent self-attention layers. The token filter can be realized using a very simple network, where we utilize multi-layer perceptron. Except for the uniqueness of performing token filtering only once from the very beginning prior to self-attention, the other core feature making our method different from the other token filters lies in the predictability of token impact from a feature selection point of view. The experiments show that the proposed method provides an efficient way to approach a light weighted model after optimized with a backbone by means of fine tune, which is easy to be deployed in comparison with the existing methods based on training from scratch.

**Title:** DuDGAN: Improving Class-Conditional GANs via Dual-Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14849  
**Abstract:** Class-conditional image generation using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been investigated through various techniques; however, it continues to face challenges such as mode collapse, training instability, and low-quality output in cases of datasets with high intra-class variation. Furthermore, most GANs often converge in larger iterations, resulting in poor iteration efficacy in training procedures. While Diffusion-GAN has shown potential in generating realistic samples, it has a critical limitation in generating class-conditional samples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach for class-conditional image generation using GANs called DuDGAN, which incorporates a dual diffusion-based noise injection process. Our method consists of three unique networks: a discriminator, a generator, and a classifier. During the training process, Gaussian-mixture noises are injected into the two noise-aware networks, the discriminator and the classifier, in distinct ways. This noisy data helps to prevent overfitting by gradually introducing more challenging tasks, leading to improved model performance. As a result, our method outperforms state-of-the-art conditional GAN models for image generation in terms of performance. We evaluated our method using the AFHQ, Food-101, and CIFAR-10 datasets and observed superior results across metrics such as FID, KID, Precision, and Recall score compared with comparison models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

**Title:** BUFFET: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Few-shot Cross-lingual  Transfer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14857  
**Abstract:** Despite remarkable advancements in few-shot generalization in natural language processing, most models are developed and evaluated primarily in English. To facilitate research on few-shot cross-lingual transfer, we introduce a new benchmark, called BUFFET, which unifies 15 diverse tasks across 54 languages in a sequence-to-sequence format and provides a fixed set of few-shot examples and instructions. BUFFET is designed to establish a rigorous and equitable evaluation framework for few-shot cross-lingual transfer across a broad range of tasks and languages. Using BUFFET, we perform thorough evaluations of state-of-the-art multilingual large language models with different transfer methods, namely in-context learning and fine-tuning. Our findings reveal significant room for improvement in few-shot in-context cross-lingual transfer. In particular, ChatGPT with in-context learning often performs worse than much smaller mT5-base models fine-tuned on English task data and few-shot in-language examples. Our analysis suggests various avenues for future research in few-shot cross-lingual transfer, such as improved pretraining, understanding, and future evaluations.

**Title:** Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient  Pre-LN Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14858  
**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by up to 10%.

**Title:** CAR: Conceptualization-Augmented Reasoner for Zero-Shot Commonsense  Question Answering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14869  
**Abstract:** The task of zero-shot commonsense question answering evaluates models on their capacity to reason about general scenarios beyond those presented in specific datasets. Existing approaches for tackling this task leverage external knowledge from CommonSense Knowledge Bases (CSKBs) by pretraining the model on synthetic QA pairs constructed from CSKBs. In these approaches, negative examples (distractors) are formulated by randomly sampling from CSKBs using fairly primitive keyword constraints. However, two bottlenecks limit these approaches: the inherent incompleteness of CSKBs limits the semantic coverage of synthetic QA pairs, and the lack of human annotations makes the sampled negative examples potentially uninformative and contradictory. To tackle these limitations above, we propose Conceptualization-Augmented Reasoner (CAR), a zero-shot commonsense question-answering framework that fully leverages the power of conceptualization. Specifically, CAR abstracts a commonsense knowledge triple to many higher-level instances, which increases the coverage of CSKB and expands the ground-truth answer space, reducing the likelihood of selecting false-negative distractors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAR more robustly generalizes to answering questions about zero-shot commonsense scenarios than existing methods, including large language models, such as GPT3.5 and ChatGPT. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/CAR.

**Title:** ClusterLLM: Large Language Models as a Guide for Text Clustering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14871  
**Abstract:** We introduce ClusterLLM, a novel text clustering framework that leverages feedback from an instruction-tuned large language model, such as ChatGPT. Compared with traditional unsupervised methods that builds upon "small" embedders, ClusterLLM exhibits two intriguing advantages: (1) it enjoys the emergent capability of LLM even if its embeddings are inaccessible; and (2) it understands the user's preference on clustering through textual instruction and/or a few annotated data. First, we prompt ChatGPT for insights on clustering perspective by constructing hard triplet questions <does A better correspond to B than C>, where A, B and C are similar data points that belong to different clusters according to small embedder. We empirically show that this strategy is both effective for fine-tuning small embedder and cost-efficient to query ChatGPT. Second, we prompt ChatGPT for helps on clustering granularity by carefully designed pairwise questions <do A and B belong to the same category>, and tune the granularity from cluster hierarchies that is the most consistent with the ChatGPT answers. Extensive experiments on 14 datasets show that ClusterLLM consistently improves clustering quality, at an average cost of ~$0.6 per dataset.

**Title:** From Words to Wires: Generating Functioning Electronic Devices from  Natural Language Descriptions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14874  
**Abstract:** In this work, we show that contemporary language models have a previously unknown skill -- the capacity for electronic circuit design from high-level textual descriptions, akin to code generation. We introduce two benchmarks: Pins100, assessing model knowledge of electrical components, and Micro25, evaluating a model's capability to design common microcontroller circuits and code in the Arduino ecosystem that involve input, output, sensors, motors, protocols, and logic -- with models such as GPT-4 and Claude-V1 achieving between 60% to 96% Pass@1 on generating full devices. We include six case studies of using language models as a design assistant for moderately complex devices, such as a radiation-powered random number generator, an emoji keyboard, a visible spectrometer, and several assistive devices, while offering a qualitative analysis performance, outlining evaluation challenges, and suggesting areas of development to improve complex circuit design and practical utility. With this work, we aim to spur research at the juncture of natural language processing and electronic design.

**Title:** Leveraging GPT-4 for Automatic Translation Post-Editing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14878  
**Abstract:** While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) represents the leading approach to Machine Translation (MT), the outputs of NMT models still require translation post-editing to rectify errors and enhance quality, particularly under critical settings. In this work, we formalize the task of translation post-editing with Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the use of GPT-4 to automatically post-edit NMT outputs across several language pairs. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 is adept at translation post-editing and produces meaningful edits even when the target language is not English. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on WMT-22 English-Chinese, English-German, Chinese-English and German-English language pairs using GPT-4 based post-editing, as evaluated by state-of-the-art MT quality metrics.

**Title:** ByteSized32: A Corpus and Challenge Task for Generating Task-Specific  World Models Expressed as Text Games  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14879  
**Abstract:** In this work we examine the ability of language models to generate explicit world models of scientific and common-sense reasoning tasks by framing this as a problem of generating text-based games. To support this, we introduce ByteSized32, a corpus of 32 highly-templated text games written in Python totaling 24k lines of code, each centered around a particular task, and paired with a set of 16 unseen text game specifications for evaluation. We propose a suite of automatic and manual metrics for assessing simulation validity, compliance with task specifications, playability, winnability, and alignment with the physical world. In a single-shot evaluation of GPT-4 on this simulation-as-code-generation task, we find it capable of producing runnable games in 27% of cases, highlighting the difficulty of this challenge task. We discuss areas of future improvement, including GPT-4's apparent capacity to perform well at simulating near canonical task solutions, with performance dropping off as simulations include distractors or deviate from canonical solutions in the action space.

**Title:** Multiresolution Feature Guidance Based Transformer for Anomaly Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14880  
**Abstract:** Anomaly detection is represented as an unsupervised learning to identify deviated images from normal images. In general, there are two main challenges of anomaly detection tasks, i.e., the class imbalance and the unexpectedness of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution feature guidance method based on Transformer named GTrans for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. In GTrans, an Anomaly Guided Network (AGN) pre-trained on ImageNet is developed to provide surrogate labels for features and tokens. Under the tacit knowledge guidance of the AGN, the anomaly detection network named Trans utilizes Transformer to effectively establish a relationship between features with multiresolution, enhancing the ability of the Trans in fitting the normal data manifold. Due to the strong generalization ability of AGN, GTrans locates anomalies by comparing the differences in spatial distance and direction of multi-scale features extracted from the AGN and the Trans. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed GTrans achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization on the MVTec AD dataset. GTrans achieves image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection AUROC scores of 99.0% and 97.9% on the MVTec AD dataset, respectively.

**Title:** Text encoders are performance bottlenecks in contrastive vision-language  models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14897  
**Abstract:** Performant vision-language (VL) models like CLIP represent captions using a single vector. How much information about language is lost in this bottleneck? We first curate CompPrompts, a set of increasingly compositional image captions that VL models should be able to capture (e.g., single object, to object+property, to multiple interacting objects). Then, we train text-only recovery probes that aim to reconstruct captions from single-vector text representations produced by several VL models. This approach doesn't require images, allowing us to test on a broader range of scenes compared to prior work. We find that: 1) CLIP's text encoder falls short on object relationships, attribute-object association, counting, and negations; 2) some text encoders work significantly better than others; and 3) text-only recovery performance predicts multi-modal matching performance on ControlledImCaps: a new evaluation benchmark we collect+release consisting of fine-grained compositional images+captions. Specifically -- our results suggest text-only recoverability is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for modeling compositional factors in contrastive vision+language models. We release data+code.

**Title:** Chain-of-Questions Training with Latent Answers for Robust Multistep  Question Answering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14901  
**Abstract:** We train a language model (LM) to robustly answer multistep questions by generating and answering sub-questions. We propose Chain-of-Questions, a framework that trains a model to generate sub-questions and sub-answers one at a time by leveraging human annotated question decomposition meaning representation (QDMR). The key technical challenge is that QDMR only contains sub-questions but not answers to those sub-questions, so we treat sub-answers as latent variables and optimize them using a novel dynamic mixture of Hard-EM and MAPO. Chain-of-Questions greatly outperforms strong neuro-symbolic methods by 9.0 F1 on DROP contrast set, and outperforms GPT-3.5 by 24.3 F1 on HOTPOTQA adversarial set, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

**Title:** Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models to Construct and Utilize  World Models for Model-based Task Planning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14909  
**Abstract:** There is a growing interest in applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as planners are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited correctness of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with simulators or even the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that constructs an explicit world (domain) model in planning domain definition language (PDDL) and then uses it to plan with sound domain-independent planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not generate a fully functional PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface between PDDL and sources of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans. For users who lack a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into natural language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered by the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users to correct domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and correcting (through interactive prompting) every generated plan as in previous work. On two IPC domains and a Household domain that is more complicated than commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld, we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for over 40 actions, and the corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve 48 challenging planning tasks. Resources including the source code will be released at: https://guansuns.github.io/pages/llm-dm.

**Title:** GAMUS: A Geometry-aware Multi-modal Semantic Segmentation Benchmark for  Remote Sensing Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14914  
**Abstract:** Geometric information in the normalized digital surface models (nDSM) is highly correlated with the semantic class of the land cover. Exploiting two modalities (RGB and nDSM (height)) jointly has great potential to improve the segmentation performance. However, it is still an under-explored field in remote sensing due to the following challenges. First, the scales of existing datasets are relatively small and the diversity of existing datasets is limited, which restricts the ability of validation. Second, there is a lack of unified benchmarks for performance assessment, which leads to difficulties in comparing the effectiveness of different models. Last, sophisticated multi-modal semantic segmentation methods have not been deeply explored for remote sensing data. To cope with these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a new remote-sensing benchmark dataset for multi-modal semantic segmentation based on RGB-Height (RGB-H) data. Towards a fair and comprehensive analysis of existing methods, the proposed benchmark consists of 1) a large-scale dataset including co-registered RGB and nDSM pairs and pixel-wise semantic labels; 2) a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of existing multi-modal fusion strategies for both convolutional and Transformer-based networks on remote sensing data. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective Transformer-based intermediary multi-modal fusion (TIMF) module to improve the semantic segmentation performance through adaptive token-level multi-modal fusion.The designed benchmark can foster future research on developing new methods for multi-modal learning on remote sensing data. Extensive analyses of those methods are conducted and valuable insights are provided through the experimental results. Code for the benchmark and baselines can be accessed at \url{https://github.com/EarthNets/RSI-MMSegmentation}.

**Title:** Approximation and existence of a viscoelastic phase-field model for  tumour growth in two and three dimensions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14915  
**Abstract:** In this work, we present a phase-field model for tumour growth, where a diffuse interface separates a tumour from the surrounding host tissue. In our model, we consider transport processes by an internal, non-solenoidal velocity field. We include viscoelastic effects with the help of a general Oldroyd-B type description with relaxation and possible stress generation by growth. The elastic energy density is coupled to the phase-field variable which allows to model invasive growth towards areas with less mechanical resistance. The main analytical result is the existence of weak solutions in two and three space dimensions in the case of additional stress diffusion. The idea behind the proof is to use a numerical approximation with a fully-practical, stable and (subsequence) converging finite element scheme. The physical properties of the model are preserved with the help of a regularization technique, uniform estimates and a limit passage on the fully-discrete level. Finally, we illustrate the practicability of the discrete scheme with the help of numerical simulations in two and three dimensions.

**Title:** Towards Reliable Misinformation Mitigation: Generalization, Uncertainty,  and GPT-4  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14928  
**Abstract:** Misinformation poses a critical societal challenge, and current approaches have yet to produce an effective solution. We propose focusing on generalization, soft classification, and leveraging recent large language models to create more practical tools in contexts where perfect predictions remain unattainable. We begin by demonstrating that GPT-4 and other language models can outperform existing methods in the literature. Next, we explore their generalization, revealing that GPT-4 and RoBERTa-large exhibit critical differences in failure modes, which offer potential for significant performance improvements. Finally, we show that these models can be employed in soft classification frameworks to better quantify uncertainty. We find that models with inferior hard classification results can achieve superior soft classification performance. Overall, this research lays groundwork for future tools that can drive real-world progress on misinformation.

**Title:** Adversarial Demonstration Attacks on Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14950  
**Abstract:** With the emergence of more powerful large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, in-context learning (ICL) has gained significant prominence in leveraging these models for specific tasks by utilizing data-label pairs as precondition prompts. While incorporating demonstrations can greatly enhance the performance of LLMs across various tasks, it may introduce a new security concern: attackers can manipulate only the demonstrations without changing the input to perform an attack. In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose an ICL attack based on TextAttack, which aims to only manipulate the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decreases. Furthermore, we also observe that adversarially attacked demonstrations exhibit transferability to diverse input examples. These findings emphasize the critical security risks associated with ICL and underscore the necessity for extensive research on the robustness of ICL, particularly given its increasing significance in the advancement of LLMs.

**Title:** Focus Your Attention (with Adaptive IIR Filters)  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14952  
**Abstract:** We present a new layer in which dynamic (i.e.,input-dependent) Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters of order two are used to process the input sequence prior to applying conventional attention. The input is split into chunks, and the coefficients of these filters are determined based on previous chunks to maintain causality. Despite their relatively low order, the causal adaptive filters are shown to focus attention on the relevant sequence elements. The layer performs on-par with state of the art networks, with a fraction of the parameters and with time complexity that is sub-quadratic with input size. The obtained layer is favorable to layers such as Heyna, GPT2, and Mega, both with respect to the number of parameters and the obtained level of performance on multiple long-range sequence problems.

**Title:** Editing Commonsense Knowledge in GPT  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14956  
**Abstract:** Memory editing methods for updating encyclopedic knowledge in transformers have received increasing attention for their efficacy, specificity, and generalization advantages. However, it remains unclear if such methods can be adapted for the more nuanced domain of commonsense knowledge. We propose $MEMIT_{CSK}$, an adaptation of MEMIT to edit commonsense mistakes in GPT-2 Large and XL. We extend editing to various token locations and employ a robust layer selection strategy. Models edited by $MEMIT_{CSK}$ outperforms the fine-tuning baselines by 10.97% and 10.73% F1 scores on subsets of PEP3k and 20Q. We further propose a novel evaluation dataset, MEMIT-CSK-PROBE, that contains unaffected neighborhood, affected neighborhood, affected paraphrase, and affected reasoning challenges. $MEMIT_{CSK}$ demonstrates favorable semantic generalization, outperforming fine-tuning baselines by 13.72% and 5.57% overall scores on MEMIT-CSK-PROBE. These results suggest a compelling future direction of incorporating context-specific user feedback concerning commonsense in GPT by direct model editing, rectifying and customizing model behaviors via human-in-the-loop systems.

**Title:** ICDAR 2023 Competition on Robust Layout Segmentation in Corporate  Documents  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14962  
**Abstract:** Transforming documents into machine-processable representations is a challenging task due to their complex structures and variability in formats. Recovering the layout structure and content from PDF files or scanned material has remained a key problem for decades. ICDAR has a long tradition in hosting competitions to benchmark the state-of-the-art and encourage the development of novel solutions to document layout understanding. In this report, we present the results of our \textit{ICDAR 2023 Competition on Robust Layout Segmentation in Corporate Documents}, which posed the challenge to accurately segment the page layout in a broad range of document styles and domains, including corporate reports, technical literature and patents. To raise the bar over previous competitions, we engineered a hard competition dataset and proposed the recent DocLayNet dataset for training. We recorded 45 team registrations and received official submissions from 21 teams. In the presented solutions, we recognize interesting combinations of recent computer vision models, data augmentation strategies and ensemble methods to achieve remarkable accuracy in the task we posed. A clear trend towards adoption of vision-transformer based methods is evident. The results demonstrate substantial progress towards achieving robust and highly generalizing methods for document layout understanding.

**Title:** Tricking LLMs into Disobedience: Understanding, Analyzing, and  Preventing Jailbreaks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14965  
**Abstract:** Recent explorations with commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that non-expert users can jailbreak LLMs by simply manipulating the prompts; resulting in degenerate output behavior, privacy and security breaches, offensive outputs, and violations of content regulator policies. Limited formal studies have been carried out to formalize and analyze these attacks and their mitigations. We bridge this gap by proposing a formalism and a taxonomy of known (and possible) jailbreaks. We perform a survey of existing jailbreak methods and their effectiveness on open-source and commercial LLMs (such as GPT 3.5, OPT, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5-xxl). We further propose a limited set of prompt guards and discuss their effectiveness against known attack types.

**Title:** OverPrompt: Enhancing ChatGPT Capabilities through an Efficient  In-Context Learning Approach  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14973  
**Abstract:** The exceptional performance of pre-trained large language models has revolutionised various applications, but their adoption in production environments is hindered by prohibitive costs and inefficiencies, particularly when utilising long prompts. This paper proposes OverPrompt, an in-context learning method aimed at improving LLM efficiency and performance by processing multiple inputs in parallel. Evaluated across diverse datasets, OverPrompt enhances task efficiency and integrates a diverse range of examples for improved performance. Particularly, it amplifies fact-checking and sentiment analysis tasks when supplemented with contextual information.

**Title:** GPTAraEval: A Comprehensive Evaluation of ChatGPT on Arabic NLP  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14976  
**Abstract:** The recent emergence of ChatGPT has brought a revolutionary change in the landscape of NLP. Although ChatGPT has consistently shown impressive performance on English benchmarks, its exact capabilities on most other languages remain largely unknown. To better understand ChatGPT's capabilities on Arabic, we present a large-scale evaluation of the model on a broad range of Arabic NLP tasks. Namely, we evaluate ChatGPT on 32 diverse natural language understanding and generation tasks on over 60 different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first performance analysis of ChatGPT on Arabic NLP at such a massive scale. Our results show that, despite its success on English benchmarks, ChatGPT trained in-context (few-shot) is consistently outperformed by much smaller dedicated models finetuned on Arabic. These results suggest that there is significant place for improvement for instruction-tuned LLMs such as ChatGPT.

**Title:** Benchmarking Arabic AI with Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14982  
**Abstract:** With large Foundation Models (FMs), language technologies (AI in general) are entering a new paradigm: eliminating the need for developing large-scale task-specific datasets and supporting a variety of tasks through set-ups ranging from zero-shot to few-shot learning. However, understanding FMs capabilities requires a systematic benchmarking effort by comparing FMs performance with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) task-specific models. With that goal, past work focused on the English language and included a few efforts with multiple languages. Our study contributes to ongoing research by evaluating FMs performance for standard Arabic NLP and Speech processing, including a range of tasks from sequence tagging to content classification across diverse domains. We start with zero-shot learning using GPT-3.5-turbo, Whisper, and USM, addressing 33 unique tasks using 59 publicly available datasets resulting in 96 test setups. For a few tasks, FMs performs on par or exceeds the performance of the SOTA models but for the majority it under-performs. Given the importance of prompt for the FMs performance, we discuss our prompt strategies in detail and elaborate on our findings. Our future work on Arabic AI will explore few-shot prompting, expand the range of tasks, and investigate additional open-source models.

**Title:** IdealGPT: Iteratively Decomposing Vision and Language Reasoning via  Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14985  
**Abstract:** The field of vision-and-language (VL) understanding has made unprecedented progress with end-to-end large pre-trained VL models (VLMs). However, they still fall short in zero-shot reasoning tasks that require multi-step inferencing. To achieve this goal, previous works resort to a divide-and-conquer pipeline. In this paper, we argue that previous efforts have several inherent shortcomings: 1) They rely on domain-specific sub-question decomposing models. 2) They force models to predict the final answer even if the sub-questions or sub-answers provide insufficient information. We address these limitations via IdealGPT, a framework that iteratively decomposes VL reasoning using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, IdealGPT utilizes an LLM to generate sub-questions, a VLM to provide corresponding sub-answers, and another LLM to reason to achieve the final answer. These three modules perform the divide-and-conquer procedure iteratively until the model is confident about the final answer to the main question. We evaluate IdealGPT on multiple challenging VL reasoning tasks under a zero-shot setting. In particular, our IdealGPT outperforms the best existing GPT-4-like models by an absolute 10% on VCR and 15% on SNLI-VE. Code is available at https://github.com/Hxyou/IdealGPT

**Title:** Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14992  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, CoT). However, LLMs can still struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning. The deficiency stems from the key fact that LLMs lack an internal $\textit{world model}$ to predict the world $\textit{state}$ (e.g., environment status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of actions. This prevents LLMs from performing deliberate planning akin to human brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new LLM reasoning framework, $\underline{R}\textit{easoning vi}\underline{a} \underline{P}\textit{lanning}$ $\textbf{(RAP)}$. RAP repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During reasoning, the LLM (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the guidance of the LLM (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between exploration $\textit{vs.}$ exploitation. We apply RAP to a variety of challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority of RAP over various strong baselines, including CoT and least-to-most prompting with self-consistency. RAP on LLAMA-33B surpasses CoT on GPT-4 with 33% relative improvement in a plan generation setting.

**Title:** RefGPT: Reference -> Truthful & Customized Dialogues Generation by GPTs  and for GPTs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14994  
**Abstract:** General chat models, like ChatGPT, have attained impressive capability to resolve a wide range of NLP tasks by tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality instruction data. However, collecting human-written high-quality data, especially multi-turn dialogues, is expensive and unattainable for most people. Though previous studies have used powerful LLMs to generate the dialogues automatically, but they all suffer from generating untruthful dialogues because of the LLMs hallucination. Therefore, we propose a method called RefGPT to generate enormous truthful and customized dialogues without worrying about factual errors caused by the model hallucination. RefGPT solves the model hallucination in dialogue generation by restricting the LLMs to leverage the given reference instead of reciting their own knowledge to generate dialogues. Additionally, RefGPT adds detailed controls on every utterances to enable highly customization capability, which previous studies have ignored. On the basis of RefGPT, we also propose two high-quality dialogue datasets generated by GPT-4, namely RefGPT-Fact and RefGPT-Code. RefGPT-Fact is 100k multi-turn dialogue datasets based on factual knowledge and RefGPT-Code is 76k multi-turn dialogue dataset covering a wide range of coding scenarios. Our code and datasets are released in https://github.com/ziliwangnlp/RefGPT

**Title:** A RelEntLess Benchmark for Modelling Graded Relations between Named  Entities  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15002  
**Abstract:** Relations such as "is influenced by", "is known for" or "is a competitor of" are inherently graded: we can rank entity pairs based on how well they satisfy these relations, but it is hard to draw a line between those pairs that satisfy them and those that do not. Such graded relations play a central role in many applications, yet they are typically not covered by existing Knowledge Graphs. In this paper, we consider the possibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to fill this gap. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark, in which entity pairs have to be ranked according to how much they satisfy a given graded relation. The task is formulated as a few-shot ranking problem, where models only have access to a description of the relation and five prototypical instances. We use the proposed benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art relation embedding strategies as well as several recent LLMs, covering both publicly available LLMs and closed models such as GPT-4. Overall, we find a strong correlation between model size and performance, with smaller Language Models struggling to outperform a naive baseline. The results of the largest Flan-T5 and OPT models are remarkably strong, although a clear gap with human performance remains.

**Title:** LLMDet: A Large Language Models Detection Tool  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15004  
**Abstract:** With the advancement of generative language models, the generated text has come remarkably close to high-quality human-authored text in terms of fluency and diversity. This calls for a highly practical detection tool that can identify the source of text, preferably pinpointing the language model it originates from. However, existing detection tools typically require access to language models and can only differentiate between machine-generated and human-authored text, failing to meet the requirements of rapid detection and text tracing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient, secure, and scalable detection tool called LLMDet, which calculates the proxy perplexity of text by utilizing the prior information of the model's next-token probabilities, obtained through pre-training. Subsequently, we use the self-watermarking information of the model, as measured by proxy perplexity, to detect the source of the text. We found that our method demonstrates impressive detection performance while ensuring speed and security, particularly achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.97\% for human-authored text. Furthermore, our detection tool also shows promising results in identifying the large language model (e.g., GPT-2, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna...) responsible for the text. We release the code and processed data at \url{https://github.com/TrustedLLM/LLMDet}.

**Title:** Sentiment Analysis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Reality Check  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15005  
**Abstract:** Sentiment analysis (SA) has been a long-standing research area in natural language processing. It can offer rich insights into human sentiments and opinions and has thus seen considerable interest from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, there is a great potential for their employment on SA problems. However, the extent to which existing LLMs can be leveraged for different sentiment analysis tasks remains unclear. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive investigation into the capabilities of LLMs in performing various sentiment analysis tasks, from conventional sentiment classification to aspect-based sentiment analysis and multifaceted analysis of subjective texts. We evaluate performance across 13 tasks on 26 datasets and compare the results against small language models (SLMs) trained on domain-specific datasets. Our study reveals that while LLMs demonstrate satisfactory performance in simpler tasks, they lag behind in more complex tasks requiring deeper understanding or structured sentiment information. However, LLMs significantly outperform SLMs in few-shot learning settings, suggesting their potential when annotation resources are limited. We also highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices in assessing LLMs' SA abilities and propose a novel benchmark, \textsc{SentiEval}, for a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation. Data and code during our investigations are available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LLM-Sentiment}.

**Title:** Are Chatbots Ready for Privacy-Sensitive Applications? An Investigation  into Input Regurgitation and Prompt-Induced Sanitization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15008  
**Abstract:** LLM-powered chatbots are becoming widely adopted in applications such as healthcare, personal assistants, industry hiring decisions, etc. In many of these cases, chatbots are fed sensitive, personal information in their prompts, as samples for in-context learning, retrieved records from a database, or as part of the conversation. The information provided in the prompt could directly appear in the output, which might have privacy ramifications if there is sensitive information there. As such, in this paper, we aim to understand the input copying and regurgitation capabilities of these models during inference and how they can be directly instructed to limit this copying by complying with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, based on their internal knowledge of them. More specifically, we find that when ChatGPT is prompted to summarize cover letters of a 100 candidates, it would retain personally identifiable information (PII) verbatim in 57.4% of cases, and we find this retention to be non-uniform between different subgroups of people, based on attributes such as gender identity. We then probe ChatGPT's perception of privacy-related policies and privatization mechanisms by directly instructing it to provide compliant outputs and observe a significant omission of PII from output.

**Title:** ChatAgri: Exploring Potentials of ChatGPT on Cross-linguistic  Agricultural Text Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15024  
**Abstract:** In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a massive amount of agricultural news text is being posted on the Internet, in which massive agricultural knowledge has been accumulated. In this context, it is urgent to explore effective text classification techniques for users to access the required agricultural knowledge with high efficiency. Mainstream deep learning approaches employing fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance gains over the past few years. Nonetheless, these methods still face many drawbacks that are complex to solve, including: 1. Limited agricultural training data due to the expensive-cost and labour-intensive annotation; 2. Poor domain transferability, especially of cross-linguistic ability; 3. Complex and expensive large models deployment.Inspired by the extraordinary success brought by the recent ChatGPT (e.g. GPT-3.5, GPT-4), in this work, we systematically investigate and explore the capability and utilization of ChatGPT applying to the agricultural informatization field. ....(shown in article)....

**Title:** Dior-CVAE: Diffusion Priors in Variational Dialog Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15025  
**Abstract:** Conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) have been used recently for diverse response generation, by introducing latent variables to represent the relationship between a dialog context and its potential responses. However, the diversity of the generated responses brought by a CVAE model is limited due to the oversimplified assumption of the isotropic Gaussian prior. We propose, Dior-CVAE, a hierarchical CVAE model with an informative prior produced by a diffusion model. Dior-CVAE derives a series of layer-wise latent variables using attention mechanism and infusing them into decoder layers accordingly. We propose memory dropout in the latent infusion to alleviate posterior collapse. The prior distribution of the latent variables is parameterized by a diffusion model to introduce a multimodal distribution. Overall, experiments on two popular open-domain dialog datasets indicate the advantages of our approach over previous Transformer-based variational dialog models in dialog response generation. We publicly release the code for reproducing Dior-CVAE and all baselines at https://github.com/SkyFishMoon/Latent-Diffusion-Response-Generation.

**Title:** How to Distill your BERT: An Empirical Study on the Impact of Weight  Initialisation and Distillation Objectives  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15032  
**Abstract:** Recently, various intermediate layer distillation (ILD) objectives have been shown to improve compression of BERT models via Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, a comprehensive evaluation of the objectives in both task-specific and task-agnostic settings is lacking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work comprehensively evaluating distillation objectives in both settings. We show that attention transfer gives the best performance overall. We also study the impact of layer choice when initializing the student from the teacher layers, finding a significant impact on the performance in task-specific distillation. For vanilla KD and hidden states transfer, initialisation with lower layers of the teacher gives a considerable improvement over higher layers, especially on the task of QNLI (up to an absolute percentage change of 17.8 in accuracy). Attention transfer behaves consistently under different initialisation settings. We release our code as an efficient transformer-based model distillation framework for further studies.

**Title:** SmartTrim: Adaptive Tokens and Parameters Pruning for Efficient  Vision-Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15033  
**Abstract:** Despite achieving remarkable performance on various vision-language tasks, Transformer-based pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) still suffer from efficiency issues arising from long inputs and numerous parameters, limiting their real-world applications. However, the huge computation is redundant for most samples and the degree of redundancy and the respective components vary significantly depending on tasks and input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive acceleration method SmartTrim for VLMs, which adjusts the inference overhead based on the complexity of instances. Specifically, SmartTrim incorporates lightweight trimming modules into the backbone to perform task-specific pruning on redundant inputs and parameters, without the need for additional pre-training or data augmentation. Since visual and textual representations complement each other in VLMs, we propose to leverage cross-modal interaction information to provide more critical semantic guidance for identifying redundant parts. Meanwhile, we introduce a self-distillation strategy that encourages the trimmed model to be consistent with the full-capacity model, which yields further performance gains. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartTrim significantly reduces the computation overhead (2-3 times) of various VLMs with comparable performance (only a 1-2% degradation) on various vision-language tasks. Compared to previous acceleration methods, SmartTrim attains a better efficiency-performance trade-off, demonstrating great potential for application in resource-constrained scenarios.

**Title:** Is GPT-4 a Good Data Analyst?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15038  
**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their powerful capabilities in plenty of domains and tasks, including context understanding, code generation, language generation, data storytelling, etc., many data analysts may raise concerns if their jobs will be replaced by AI. This controversial topic has drawn a lot of attention in public. However, we are still at a stage of divergent opinions without any definitive conclusion. Motivated by this, we raise the research question of "is GPT-4 a good data analyst?" in this work and aim to answer it by conducting head-to-head comparative studies. In detail, we regard GPT-4 as a data analyst to perform end-to-end data analysis with databases from a wide range of domains. We propose a framework to tackle the problems by carefully designing the prompts for GPT-4 to conduct experiments. We also design several task-specific evaluation metrics to systematically compare the performance between several professional human data analysts and GPT-4. Experimental results show that GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to humans. We also provide in-depth discussions about our results to shed light on further studies before we reach the conclusion that GPT-4 can replace data analysts.

**Title:** Decomposing Complex Queries for Tip-of-the-tongue Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15053  
**Abstract:** When re-finding items, users who forget or are uncertain about identifying details often rely on creative strategies for expressing their information needs -- complex queries that describe content elements (e.g., book characters or events), information beyond the document text (e.g., descriptions of book covers), or personal context (e.g., when they read a book). This retrieval setting, called tip of the tongue (TOT), is especially challenging for models heavily reliant on lexical and semantic overlap between query and document text. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for handling such complex queries by decomposing the query into individual clues, routing those as sub-queries to specialized retrievers, and ensembling the results. This approach allows us to take advantage of off-the-shelf retrievers (e.g., CLIP for retrieving images of book covers) or incorporate retriever-specific logic (e.g., date constraints). We show that our framework incorportating query decompositions into retrievers can improve gold book recall up to 7% relative again for Recall@5 on a new collection of 14,441 real-world query-book pairs from an online community for resolving TOT inquiries.

**Title:** Prompt Optimization of Large Language Model for Interactive Tasks  without Gradient and Demonstrations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15064  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable language proficiency, but they face challenges when solving interactive tasks independently. Existing methods either rely on gradient access, which is often inaccessible in state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4, or necessitate diverse and high-quality in-context demonstrations. In this study, we propose LLM-PO, a novel approach that enables LLMs to address these tasks without gradient access or extensive demonstrations. The key idea is to maintain a text-based plan and ask LLMs to reflect on pros and cons of the current plan based on experience collected with it, to update the plan, and to collect more experiences with the new plan. Experiments on HotpotQA demonstrate that LLM-PO achieves higher or on par success rates compared to in-context learning (ICL) baselines while requiring less inference cost.

**Title:** GPT4Graph: Can Large Language Models Understand Graph Structured Data ?  An Empirical Evaluation and Benchmarking  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15066  
**Abstract:** Large language models~(LLM) like ChatGPT have become indispensable to artificial general intelligence~(AGI), demonstrating excellent performance in various natural language processing tasks. In the real world, graph data is ubiquitous and an essential part of AGI and prevails in domains like social network analysis, bioinformatics and recommender systems. The training corpus of large language models often includes some algorithmic components, which allows them to achieve certain effects on some graph data-related problems. However, there is still little research on their performance on a broader range of graph-structured data. In this study, we conduct an extensive investigation to assess the proficiency of LLMs in comprehending graph data, employing a diverse range of structural and semantic-related tasks. Our analysis encompasses 10 distinct tasks that evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in graph understanding. Through our study, we not only uncover the current limitations of language models in comprehending graph structures and performing associated reasoning tasks but also emphasize the necessity for further advancements and novel approaches to enhance their graph processing capabilities. Our findings contribute valuable insights towards bridging the gap between language models and graph understanding, paving the way for more effective graph mining and knowledge extraction.

**Title:** ToMChallenges: A Principle-Guided Dataset and Diverse Evaluation Tasks  for Exploring Theory of Mind  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15068  
**Abstract:** Theory of Mind (ToM), the capacity to comprehend the mental states of distinct individuals, is essential for numerous practical applications. With the development of large language models, there is a heated debate about whether they are able to perform ToM tasks. Previous studies have used different tasks and prompts to test the ToM on large language models and the results are inconsistent: some studies asserted these models are capable of exhibiting ToM, while others suggest the opposite. In this study, We present ToMChallenges, a dataset for comprehensively evaluating Theory of Mind based on Sally-Anne and Smarties tests. We created 30 variations of each test (e.g., changing the person's name, location, and items). For each variation, we test the model's understanding of different aspects: reality, belief, 1st order belief, and 2nd order belief. We adapt our data for various tasks by creating unique prompts tailored for each task category: Fill-in-the-Blank, Multiple Choice, True/False, Chain-of-Thought True/False, Question Answering, and Text Completion. If the model has a robust ToM, it should be able to achieve good performance for different prompts across different tests. We evaluated two GPT-3.5 models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, with our datasets. Our results indicate that consistent performance in ToM tasks remains a challenge.

**Title:** PathAsst: Redefining Pathology through Generative Foundation AI  Assistant for Pathology  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15072  
**Abstract:** As advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal techniques continue to mature, the development of general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has surged, with significant applications in natural image interpretation. However, the field of pathology has largely remained untapped in this regard, despite the growing need for accurate, timely, and personalized diagnostics. To bridge the gap in pathology MLLMs, we present the PathAsst in this study, which is a generative foundation AI assistant to revolutionize diagnostic and predictive analytics in pathology. To develop PathAsst, we collect over 142K high-quality pathology image-text pairs from a variety of reliable sources, including PubMed, comprehensive pathology textbooks, reputable pathology websites, and private data annotated by pathologists. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT/GPT-4, we generate over 180K instruction-following samples. Furthermore, we devise additional instruction-following data, specifically tailored for the invocation of the pathology-specific models, allowing the PathAsst to effectively interact with these models based on the input image and user intent, consequently enhancing the model's diagnostic capabilities. Subsequently, our PathAsst is trained based on Vicuna-13B language model in coordination with the CLIP vision encoder. The results of PathAsst show the potential of harnessing the AI-powered generative foundation model to improve pathology diagnosis and treatment processes. We are committed to open-sourcing our meticulously curated dataset, as well as a comprehensive toolkit designed to aid researchers in the extensive collection and preprocessing of their own datasets.

**Title:** Have LLMs Advanced Enough? A Challenging Problem Solving Benchmark For  Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15074  
**Abstract:** The performance on Large Language Models (LLMs) on existing reasoning benchmarks has shot up considerably over the past years. In response, we present JEEBench, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs. We curate 450 challenging pre-engineering mathematics, physics and chemistry problems from the IIT JEE-Advanced exam. Long-horizon reasoning on top of deep in-domain knowledge is essential for solving problems in this benchmark. Our evaluation on the GPT series of models reveals that although performance improves with newer models, the best being GPT-4, the highest performance, even after using techniques like Self-Consistency and Chain-of-Thought prompting is less than 40 percent. Our analysis demonstrates that errors in algebraic manipulation and failure in retrieving relevant domain specific concepts are primary contributors to GPT4's low performance. Given the challenging nature of the benchmark, we hope that it can guide future research in problem solving using LLMs. Our code and dataset is available here.

**Title:** HuatuoGPT, towards Taming Language Model to Be a Doctor  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15075  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present HuatuoGPT, a large language model (LLM) for medical consultation. The core recipe of HuatuoGPT is to leverage both \textit{distilled data from ChatGPT} and \textit{real-world data from doctors} in the supervised fine-tuned stage. The responses of ChatGPT are usually detailed, well-presented and informative while it cannot perform like a doctor in many aspects, e.g. for integrative diagnosis. We argue that real-world data from doctors would be complementary to distilled data in the sense the former could tame a distilled language model to perform like doctors. To better leverage the strengths of both data, we train a reward model to align the language model with the merits that both data bring, following an RLAIF (reinforced learning from AI feedback) fashion. To evaluate and benchmark the models, we propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme (including automatic and manual metrics). Experimental results demonstrate that HuatuoGPT achieves state-of-the-art results in performing medical consultation among open-source LLMs in GPT-4 evaluation, human evaluation, and medical benchmark datasets. It is worth noting that by using additional real-world data and RLAIF, the distilled language model (i.e., HuatuoGPT) outperforms its teacher model ChatGPT in most cases. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT}. The online demo is available at \url{https://www.HuatuoGPT.cn/}.

**Abstract:** Large-scale Pretrained Language Models~(LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, have shown strong abilities in multilingual translations, without being explicitly trained on parallel corpora. It is interesting how the LLMs obtain their ability to carry out translation instructions for different languages. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis by finetuning a multilingual pretrained language model, XGLM-7B, to perform multilingual translation following given instructions. Firstly, we show that the multilingual LLMs have stronger translation abilities than previously demonstrated. For a certain language pair, the performance depends on both the language families and the amount of data used in the pretraining phase. Secondly, we find that LLMs' ability to carry out translation instructions relies on the understanding of translation instruction and the alignment among different languages. With proper enhancement, LLMs could perform the translation task well even for those language pairs unseen during the instruction tuning phase.

**Title:** Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via Neural Schrödinger Bridge  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15086  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models which simulate stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to generate data from noise. Although diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, they have limitations in the unpaired image-to-image translation tasks due to the Gaussian prior assumption. Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB), which learns an SDE to translate between two arbitrary distributions, have risen as an attractive solution to this problem. However, none of SB models so far have been successful at unpaired translation between high-resolution images. In this work, we propose the Unpaired Neural Schr\"odinger Bridge (UNSB), which combines SB with adversarial training and regularization to learn a SB between unpaired data. We demonstrate that UNSB is scalable, and that it successfully solves various unpaired image-to-image translation tasks. Code: \url{https://github.com/cyclomon/UNSB}

**Title:** CSTS: Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15093  
**Abstract:** Semantic textual similarity (STS) has been a cornerstone task in NLP that measures the degree of similarity between a pair of sentences, with applications in information retrieval, question answering, and embedding methods. However, it is an inherently ambiguous task, with the sentence similarity depending on the specific aspect of interest. We resolve this ambiguity by proposing a novel task called conditional STS (C-STS) which measures similarity conditioned on an aspect elucidated in natural language (hereon, condition). As an example, the similarity between the sentences "The NBA player shoots a three-pointer." and "A man throws a tennis ball into the air to serve." is higher for the condition "The motion of the ball." (both upward) and lower for "The size of the ball." (one large and one small). C-STS's advantages are two-fold: (1) it reduces the subjectivity and ambiguity of STS, and (2) enables fine-grained similarity evaluation using diverse conditions. C-STS contains almost 20,000 instances from diverse domains and we evaluate several state-of-the-art models to demonstrate that even the most performant fine-tuning and in-context learning models (GPT-4, Flan, SimCSE) find it challenging, with Spearman correlation scores of <50. We encourage the community to evaluate their models on C-STS to provide a more holistic view of semantic similarity and natural language understanding.

**Title:** InpaintNeRF360: Text-Guided 3D Inpainting on Unbounded Neural Radiance  Fields  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15094  
**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate highly realistic novel views. However, editing 3D scenes represented by NeRF across 360-degree views, particularly removing objects while preserving geometric and photometric consistency, remains a challenging problem due to NeRF's implicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose InpaintNeRF360, a unified framework that utilizes natural language instructions as guidance for inpainting NeRF-based 3D scenes.Our approach employs a promptable segmentation model by generating multi-modal prompts from the encoded text for multiview segmentation. We apply depth-space warping to enforce viewing consistency in the segmentations, and further refine the inpainted NeRF model using perceptual priors to ensure visual plausibility. InpaintNeRF360 is capable of simultaneously removing multiple objects or modifying object appearance based on text instructions while synthesizing 3D viewing-consistent and photo-realistic inpainting. Through extensive experiments on both unbounded and frontal-facing scenes trained through NeRF, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and showcase its potential to enhance the editability of implicit radiance fields.

**Title:** Dynamic Masking Rate Schedules for MLM Pretraining  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15096  
**Abstract:** Most works on transformers trained with the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective use the original BERT model's fixed masking rate of 15%. Our work instead dynamically schedules the masking ratio throughout training. We found that linearly decreasing the masking rate from 30% to 15% over the course of pretraining improves average GLUE accuracy by 0.46% in BERT-base, compared to a standard 15% fixed rate. Further analyses demonstrate that the gains from scheduling come from being exposed to both high and low masking rate regimes. Our results demonstrate that masking rate scheduling is a simple way to improve the quality of masked language models and achieve up to a 1.89x speedup in pretraining.

**Title:** Fourier Transformer: Fast Long Range Modeling by Removing Sequence  Redundancy with FFT Operator  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15099  
**Abstract:** The transformer model is known to be computationally demanding, and prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the self-attention module uses a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to sequence length. Many researchers have focused on designing new forms of self-attention or introducing new parameters to overcome this limitation, however a large portion of them prohibits the model to inherit weights from large pretrained models. In this work, the transformer's inefficiency has been taken care of from another perspective. We propose Fourier Transformer, a simple yet effective approach by progressively removing redundancies in hidden sequence using the ready-made Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator to perform Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). Fourier Transformer is able to significantly reduce computational costs while retain the ability to inherit from various large pretrained models. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances among all transformer-based models on the long-range modeling benchmark LRA with significant improvement in both speed and space. For generative seq-to-seq tasks including CNN/DailyMail and ELI5, by inheriting the BART weights our model outperforms the standard BART and other efficient models. \footnote{Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/FourierTransformer}}

**Title:** Deceptive-NeRF: Enhancing NeRF Reconstruction using Pseudo-Observations  from Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15171  
**Abstract:** This paper introduces Deceptive-NeRF, a new method for enhancing the quality of reconstructed NeRF models using synthetically generated pseudo-observations, capable of handling sparse input and removing floater artifacts. Our proposed method involves three key steps: 1) reconstruct a coarse NeRF model from sparse inputs; 2) generate pseudo-observations based on the coarse model; 3) refine the NeRF model using pseudo-observations to produce a high-quality reconstruction. To generate photo-realistic pseudo-observations that faithfully preserve the identity of the reconstructed scene while remaining consistent with the sparse inputs, we develop a rectification latent diffusion model that generates images conditional on a coarse RGB image and depth map, which are derived from the coarse NeRF and latent text embedding from input images. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective and can generate perceptually high-quality NeRF even with very sparse inputs.

**Title:** Simultaneous identification of models and parameters of scientific  simulators  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15174  
**Abstract:** Many scientific models are composed of multiple discrete components, and scien tists often make heuristic decisions about which components to include. Bayesian inference provides a mathematical framework for systematically selecting model components, but defining prior distributions over model components and developing associated inference schemes has been challenging. We approach this problem in an amortized simulation-based inference framework: We define implicit model priors over a fixed set of candidate components and train neural networks to infer joint probability distributions over both, model components and associated parameters from simulations. To represent distributions over model components, we introduce a conditional mixture of multivariate binary distributions in the Grassmann formalism. Our approach can be applied to any compositional stochastic simulator without requiring access to likelihood evaluations. We first illustrate our method on a simple time series model with redundant components and show that it can retrieve joint posterior distribution over a set of symbolic expressions and their parameters while accurately capturing redundancy with strongly correlated posteriors. We then apply our approach to drift-diffusion models, a commonly used model class in cognitive neuroscience. After validating the method on synthetic data, we show that our approach explains experimental data as well as previous methods, but that our fully probabilistic approach can help to discover multiple data-consistent model configurations, as well as reveal non-identifiable model components and parameters. Our method provides a powerful tool for data-driven scientific inquiry which will allow scientists to systematically identify essential model components and make uncertainty-informed modelling decisions.

**Title:** SciReviewGen: A Large-scale Dataset for Automatic Literature Review  Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15186  
**Abstract:** Automatic literature review generation is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing. Although large language models have tackled literature review generation, the absence of large-scale datasets has been a stumbling block to the progress. We release SciReviewGen, consisting of over 10,000 literature reviews and 690,000 papers cited in the reviews. Based on the dataset, we evaluate recent transformer-based summarization models on the literature review generation task, including Fusion-in-Decoder extended for literature review generation. Human evaluation results show that some machine-generated summaries are comparable to human-written reviews, while revealing the challenges of automatic literature review generation such as hallucinations and a lack of detailed information. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/tetsu9923/SciReviewGen.

**Title:** IoT Threat Detection Testbed Using Generative Adversarial Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15191  
**Abstract:** The Internet of Things(IoT) paradigm provides persistent sensing and data collection capabilities and is becoming increasingly prevalent across many market sectors. However, most IoT devices emphasize usability and function over security, making them very vulnerable to malicious exploits. This concern is evidenced by the increased use of compromised IoT devices in large scale bot networks (botnets) to launch distributed denial of service(DDoS) attacks against high value targets. Unsecured IoT systems can also provide entry points to private networks, allowing adversaries relatively easy access to valuable resources and services. Indeed, these evolving IoT threat vectors (ranging from brute force attacks to remote code execution exploits) are posing key challenges. Moreover, many traditional security mechanisms are not amenable for deployment on smaller resource-constrained IoT platforms. As a result, researchers have been developing a range of methods for IoT security, with many strategies using advanced machine learning(ML) techniques. Along these lines, this paper presents a novel generative adversarial network(GAN) solution to detect threats from malicious IoT devices both inside and outside a network. This model is trained using both benign IoT traffic and global darknet data and further evaluated in a testbed with real IoT devices and malware threats.

**Title:** DiffBlender: Scalable and Composable Multimodal Text-to-Image Diffusion  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15194  
**Abstract:** The recent progress in diffusion-based text-to-image generation models has significantly expanded generative capabilities via conditioning the text descriptions. However, since relying solely on text prompts is still restrictive for fine-grained customization, we aim to extend the boundaries of conditional generation to incorporate diverse types of modalities, e.g., sketch, box, and style embedding, simultaneously. We thus design a multimodal text-to-image diffusion model, coined as DiffBlender, that achieves the aforementioned goal in a single model by training only a few small hypernetworks. DiffBlender facilitates a convenient scaling of input modalities, without altering the parameters of an existing large-scale generative model to retain its well-established knowledge. Furthermore, our study sets new standards for multimodal generation by conducting quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing approaches. By diversifying the channels of conditioning modalities, DiffBlender faithfully reflects the provided information or, in its absence, creates imaginative generation.

**Title:** Towards Adaptive Prefix Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Language Model  Fine-tuning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15212  
**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on various downstream tasks with whole parameters is prohibitively expensive. Hence, Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has attracted attention that only optimizes a few task-specific parameters with the frozen pre-trained model. In this work, we focus on prefix tuning, which only optimizes continuous prefix vectors (i.e. pseudo tokens) inserted into Transformer layers. Based on the observation that the learned syntax and semantics representation varies a lot at different layers, we argue that the adaptive prefix will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient. Thus, we propose Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT) to adjust the prefix in terms of both fine-grained token level and coarse-grained layer level with a gate mechanism. Experiments on the SuperGLUE and NER datasets show the effectiveness of APT. In addition, taking the gate as a probing, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the variable prefix.

**Title:** GTNet: Graph Transformer Network for 3D Point Cloud Classification and  Semantic Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15213  
**Abstract:** Recently, graph-based and Transformer-based deep learning networks have demonstrated excellent performances on various point cloud tasks. Most of the existing graph methods are based on static graph, which take a fixed input to establish graph relations. Moreover, many graph methods apply maximization and averaging to aggregate neighboring features, so that only a single neighboring point affects the feature of centroid or different neighboring points have the same influence on the centroid's feature, which ignoring the correlation and difference between points. Most Transformer-based methods extract point cloud features based on global attention and lack the feature learning on local neighbors. To solve the problems of these two types of models, we propose a new feature extraction block named Graph Transformer and construct a 3D point point cloud learning network called GTNet to learn features of point clouds on local and global patterns. Graph Transformer integrates the advantages of graph-based and Transformer-based methods, and consists of Local Transformer and Global Transformer modules. Local Transformer uses a dynamic graph to calculate all neighboring point weights by intra-domain cross-attention with dynamically updated graph relations, so that every neighboring point could affect the features of centroid with different weights; Global Transformer enlarges the receptive field of Local Transformer by a global self-attention. In addition, to avoid the disappearance of the gradient caused by the increasing depth of network, we conduct residual connection for centroid features in GTNet; we also adopt the features of centroid and neighbors to generate the local geometric descriptors in Local Transformer to strengthen the local information learning capability of the model. Finally, we use GTNet for shape classification, part segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks in this paper.

**Title:** Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15241  
**Abstract:** Recently, diffusion models have been successfully applied to improving adversarial robustness of image classifiers by purifying the adversarial noises or generating realistic data for adversarial training. However, the diffusion-based purification can be evaded by stronger adaptive attacks while adversarial training does not perform well under unseen threats, exhibiting inevitable limitations of these methods. To better harness the expressive power of diffusion models, in this paper we propose Robust Diffusion Classifier (RDC), a generative classifier that is constructed from a pre-trained diffusion model to be adversarially robust. Our method first maximizes the data likelihood of a given input and then predicts the class probabilities of the optimized input using the conditional likelihood of the diffusion model through Bayes' theorem. Since our method does not require training on particular adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that it is more generalizable to defend against multiple unseen threats. In particular, RDC achieves $73.24\%$ robust accuracy against $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded perturbations with $\epsilon_\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art adversarial training models by $+2.34\%$. The findings highlight the potential of generative classifiers by employing diffusion models for adversarial robustness compared with the commonly studied discriminative classifiers.

**Title:** Machine Unlearning: its nature, scope, and importance for a "delete  culture"  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15242  
**Abstract:** The article explores the cultural shift from recording to deleting information in the digital age and its implications on privacy, intellectual property (IP), and Large Language Models like ChatGPT. It begins by defining a delete culture where information, in principle legal, is made unavailable or inaccessible because unacceptable or undesirable, especially but not only due to its potential to infringe on privacy or IP. Then it focuses on two strategies in this context: deleting, to make information unavailable; and blocking, to make it inaccessible. The article argues that both strategies have significant implications, particularly for machine learning (ML) models where information is not easily made unavailable. However, the emerging research area of Machine Unlearning (MU) is highlighted as a potential solution. MU, still in its infancy, seeks to remove specific data points from ML models, effectively making them 'forget' completely specific information. If successful, MU could provide a feasible means to manage the overabundance of information and ensure a better protection of privacy and IP. However, potential ethical risks, such as misuse, overuse, and underuse of MU, should be systematically studied to devise appropriate policies.

**Title:** Delving Deeper into Data Scaling in Masked Image Modeling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15248  
**Abstract:** Understanding whether self-supervised learning methods can scale with unlimited data is crucial for training large-scale models. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the scaling capability of masked image modeling (MIM) methods (e.g., MAE) for visual recognition. Unlike most previous works that depend on the widely-used ImageNet dataset, which is manually curated and object-centric, we take a step further and propose to investigate this problem in a more practical setting. Specifically, we utilize the web-collected Coyo-700M dataset. We randomly sample varying numbers of training images from the Coyo dataset and construct a series of sub-datasets, containing 0.5M, 1M, 5M, 10M, and 100M images, for pre-training. Our goal is to investigate how the performance changes on downstream tasks when scaling with different sizes of data and models. The study reveals that: 1) MIM can be viewed as an effective method to improve the model capacity when the scale of the training data is relatively small; 2) Strong reconstruction targets can endow the models with increased capacities on downstream tasks; 3) MIM pre-training is data-agnostic under most scenarios, which means that the strategy of sampling pre-training data is non-critical. We hope these observations could provide valuable insights for future research on MIM.

**Title:** Revisiting Token Dropping Strategy in Efficient BERT Pretraining  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15273  
**Abstract:** Token dropping is a recently-proposed strategy to speed up the pretraining of masked language models, such as BERT, by skipping the computation of a subset of the input tokens at several middle layers. It can effectively reduce the training time without degrading much performance on downstream tasks. However, we empirically find that token dropping is prone to a semantic loss problem and falls short in handling semantic-intense tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective semantic-consistent learning method (ScTD) to improve the token dropping. ScTD aims to encourage the model to learn how to preserve the semantic information in the representation space. Extensive experiments on 12 tasks show that, with the help of our ScTD, token dropping can achieve consistent and significant performance gains across all task types and model sizes. More encouragingly, ScTD saves up to 57% of pretraining time and brings up to +1.56% average improvement over the vanilla token dropping.

**Title:** Self-Evolution Learning for Discriminative Language Model Pretraining  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15275  
**Abstract:** Masked language modeling, widely used in discriminative language model (e.g., BERT) pretraining, commonly adopts a random masking strategy. However, random masking does not consider the importance of the different words in the sentence meaning, where some of them are more worthy to be predicted. Therefore, various masking strategies (e.g., entity-level masking) are proposed, but most of them require expensive prior knowledge and generally train from scratch without reusing existing model weights. In this paper, we present Self-Evolution learning (SE), a simple and effective token masking and learning method to fully and wisely exploit the knowledge from data. SE focuses on learning the informative yet under-explored tokens and adaptively regularizes the training by introducing a novel Token-specific Label Smoothing approach. Experiments on 10 tasks show that our SE brings consistent and significant improvements (+1.43~2.12 average scores) upon different PLMs. In-depth analyses demonstrate that SE improves linguistic knowledge learning and generalization.

**Title:** MultiFusion: Fusing Pre-Trained Models for Multi-Lingual, Multi-Modal  Image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15296  
**Abstract:** The recent popularity of text-to-image diffusion models (DM) can largely be attributed to the intuitive interface they provide to users. The intended generation can be expressed in natural language, with the model producing faithful interpretations of text prompts. However, expressing complex or nuanced ideas in text alone can be difficult. To ease image generation, we propose MultiFusion that allows one to express complex and nuanced concepts with arbitrarily interleaved inputs of multiple modalities and languages. MutliFusion leverages pre-trained models and aligns them for integration into a cohesive system, thereby avoiding the need for extensive training from scratch. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficient transfer of capabilities from individual modules to the downstream model. Specifically, the fusion of all independent components allows the image generation module to utilize multilingual, interleaved multimodal inputs despite being trained solely on monomodal data in a single language.

**Title:** Multi-Modal Mutual Attention and Iterative Interaction for Referring  Image Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15302  
**Abstract:** We address the problem of referring image segmentation that aims to generate a mask for the object specified by a natural language expression. Many recent works utilize Transformer to extract features for the target object by aggregating the attended visual regions. However, the generic attention mechanism in Transformer only uses the language input for attention weight calculation, which does not explicitly fuse language features in its output. Thus, its output feature is dominated by vision information, which limits the model to comprehensively understand the multi-modal information, and brings uncertainty for the subsequent mask decoder to extract the output mask. To address this issue, we propose Multi-Modal Mutual Attention ($\mathrm{M^3Att}$) and Multi-Modal Mutual Decoder ($\mathrm{M^3Dec}$) that better fuse information from the two input modalities. Based on {$\mathrm{M^3Dec}$}, we further propose Iterative Multi-modal Interaction ($\mathrm{IMI}$) to allow continuous and in-depth interactions between language and vision features. Furthermore, we introduce Language Feature Reconstruction ($\mathrm{LFR}$) to prevent the language information from being lost or distorted in the extracted feature. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach significantly improves the baseline and outperforms state-of-the-art referring image segmentation methods on RefCOCO series datasets consistently.

**Title:** Training on Thin Air: Improve Image Classification with Generated Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15316  
**Abstract:** Acquiring high-quality data for training discriminative models is a crucial yet challenging aspect of building effective predictive systems. In this paper, we present Diffusion Inversion, a simple yet effective method that leverages the pre-trained generative model, Stable Diffusion, to generate diverse, high-quality training data for image classification. Our approach captures the original data distribution and ensures data coverage by inverting images to the latent space of Stable Diffusion, and generates diverse novel training images by conditioning the generative model on noisy versions of these vectors. We identify three key components that allow our generated images to successfully supplant the original dataset, leading to a 2-3x enhancement in sample complexity and a 6.5x decrease in sampling time. Moreover, our approach consistently outperforms generic prompt-based steering methods and KNN retrieval baseline across a wide range of datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate the compatibility of our approach with widely-used data augmentation techniques, as well as the reliability of the generated data in supporting various neural architectures and enhancing few-shot learning.

Moreover, we discuss the advantages of bringing everything together through ChatGPT and Internet of Things (IoT). Further, we speculate on the future of ChatGPT by considering various possibilities for study and development, such as energy-efficiency, cybersecurity, enhancing its applicability to additional technologies (Robotics and Computer Vision), strengthening human-AI communications, and bridging the technological gap. Finally, we discuss the important ethics and current trends of ChatGPT.

**Title:** Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15334  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen an impressive wave of advances recently, with models now excelling in a variety of tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and program synthesis. However, their potential to effectively use tools via API calls remains unfulfilled. This is a challenging task even for today's state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, largely due to their inability to generate accurate input arguments and their tendency to hallucinate the wrong usage of an API call. We release Gorilla, a finetuned LLaMA-based model that surpasses the performance of GPT-4 on writing API calls. When combined with a document retriever, Gorilla demonstrates a strong capability to adapt to test-time document changes, enabling flexible user updates or version changes. It also substantially mitigates the issue of hallucination, commonly encountered when prompting LLMs directly. To evaluate the model's ability, we introduce APIBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of HuggingFace, TorchHub, and TensorHub APIs. The successful integration of the retrieval system with Gorilla demonstrates the potential for LLMs to use tools more accurately, keep up with frequently updated documentation, and consequently increase the reliability and applicability of their outputs. Gorilla's code, model, data, and demo are available at https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu

**Title:** From Text to MITRE Techniques: Exploring the Malicious Use of Large  Language Models for Generating Cyber Attack Payloads  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15336  
**Abstract:** This research article critically examines the potential risks and implications arising from the malicious utilization of large language models(LLM), focusing specifically on ChatGPT and Google's Bard. Although these large language models have numerous beneficial applications, the misuse of this technology by cybercriminals for creating offensive payloads and tools is a significant concern. In this study, we systematically generated implementable code for the top-10 MITRE Techniques prevalent in 2022, utilizing ChatGPT, and conduct a comparative analysis of its performance with Google's Bard. Our experimentation reveals that ChatGPT has the potential to enable attackers to accelerate the operation of more targeted and sophisticated attacks. Additionally, the technology provides amateur attackers with more capabilities to perform a wide range of attacks and empowers script kiddies to develop customized tools that contribute to the acceleration of cybercrime. Furthermore, LLMs significantly benefits malware authors, particularly ransomware gangs, in generating sophisticated variants of wiper and ransomware attacks with ease. On a positive note, our study also highlights how offensive security researchers and pentesters can make use of LLMs to simulate realistic attack scenarios, identify potential vulnerabilities, and better protect organizations. Overall, we conclude by emphasizing the need for increased vigilance in mitigating the risks associated with LLMs. This includes implementing robust security measures, increasing awareness and education around the potential risks of this technology, and collaborating with security experts to stay ahead of emerging threats.

**Title:** A Tale of Two Features: Stable Diffusion Complements DINO for Zero-Shot  Semantic Correspondence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15347  
**Abstract:** Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant advances in generating and editing high-quality images. As a result, numerous approaches have explored the ability of diffusion model features to understand and process single images for downstream tasks, e.g., classification, semantic segmentation, and stylization. However, significantly less is known about what these features reveal across multiple, different images and objects. In this work, we exploit Stable Diffusion (SD) features for semantic and dense correspondence and discover that with simple post-processing, SD features can perform quantitatively similar to SOTA representations. Interestingly, the qualitative analysis reveals that SD features have very different properties compared to existing representation learning features, such as the recently released DINOv2: while DINOv2 provides sparse but accurate matches, SD features provide high-quality spatial information but sometimes inaccurate semantic matches. We demonstrate that a simple fusion of these two features works surprisingly well, and a zero-shot evaluation using nearest neighbors on these fused features provides a significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, e.g., SPair-71k, PF-Pascal, and TSS. We also show that these correspondences can enable interesting applications such as instance swapping in two images.

**Title:** Context-Aware Transformer Pre-Training for Answer Sentence Selection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15358  
**Abstract:** Answer Sentence Selection (AS2) is a core component for building an accurate Question Answering pipeline. AS2 models rank a set of candidate sentences based on how likely they answer a given question. The state of the art in AS2 exploits pre-trained transformers by transferring them on large annotated datasets, while using local contextual information around the candidate sentence. In this paper, we propose three pre-training objectives designed to mimic the downstream fine-tuning task of contextual AS2. This allows for specializing LMs when fine-tuning for contextual AS2. Our experiments on three public and two large-scale industrial datasets show that our pre-training approaches (applied to RoBERTa and ELECTRA) can improve baseline contextual AS2 accuracy by up to 8% on some datasets.

**Title:** Inverse Preference Learning: Preference-based RL without a Reward  Function  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15363  
**Abstract:** Reward functions are difficult to design and often hard to align with human intent. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms address these problems by learning reward functions from human feedback. However, the majority of preference-based RL methods na\"ively combine supervised reward models with off-the-shelf RL algorithms. Contemporary approaches have sought to improve performance and query complexity by using larger and more complex reward architectures such as transformers. Instead of using highly complex architectures, we develop a new and parameter-efficient algorithm, Inverse Preference Learning (IPL), specifically designed for learning from offline preference data. Our key insight is that for a fixed policy, the $Q$-function encodes all information about the reward function, effectively making them interchangeable. Using this insight, we completely eliminate the need for a learned reward function. Our resulting algorithm is simpler and more parameter-efficient.

**Title:** Peek Across: Improving Multi-Document Modeling via Cross-Document  Question-Answering  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15387  
**Abstract:** The integration of multi-document pre-training objectives into language models has resulted in remarkable improvements in multi-document downstream tasks. In this work, we propose extending this idea by pre-training a generic multi-document model from a novel cross-document question answering pre-training objective. To that end, given a set (or cluster) of topically-related documents, we systematically generate semantically-oriented questions from a salient sentence in one document and challenge the model, during pre-training, to answer these questions while "peeking" into other topically-related documents. In a similar manner, the model is also challenged to recover the sentence from which the question was generated, again while leveraging cross-document information. This novel multi-document QA formulation directs the model to better recover cross-text informational relations, and introduces a natural augmentation that artificially increases the pre-training data. Further, unlike prior multi-document models that focus on either classification or summarization tasks, our pre-training objective formulation enables the model to perform tasks that involve both short text generation (e.g., QA) and long text generation (e.g., summarization). Following this scheme, we pre-train our model -- termed QAmden -- and evaluate its performance across several multi-document tasks, including multi-document QA, summarization, and query-focused summarization, yielding improvements of up to 7%, and significantly outperforms zero-shot GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

**Title:** Sin3DM: Learning a Diffusion Model from a Single 3D Textured Shape  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15399  
**Abstract:** Synthesizing novel 3D models that resemble the input example has long been pursued by researchers and artists in computer graphics. In this paper, we present Sin3DM, a diffusion model that learns the internal patch distribution from a single 3D textured shape and generates high-quality variations with fine geometry and texture details. Training a diffusion model directly in 3D would induce large memory and computational cost. Therefore, we first compress the input into a lower-dimensional latent space and then train a diffusion model on it. Specifically, we encode the input 3D textured shape into triplane feature maps that represent the signed distance and texture fields of the input. The denoising network of our diffusion model has a limited receptive field to avoid overfitting, and uses triplane-aware 2D convolution blocks to improve the result quality. Aside from randomly generating new samples, our model also facilitates applications such as retargeting, outpainting and local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that our model can generate 3D shapes of various types with better quality than prior methods.

**Title:** Balancing the Picture: Debiasing Vision-Language Datasets with Synthetic  Contrast Sets  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15407  
**Abstract:** Vision-language models are growing in popularity and public visibility to generate, edit, and caption images at scale; but their outputs can perpetuate and amplify societal biases learned during pre-training on uncurated image-text pairs from the internet. Although debiasing methods have been proposed, we argue that these measurements of model bias lack validity due to dataset bias. We demonstrate there are spurious correlations in COCO Captions, the most commonly used dataset for evaluating bias, between background context and the gender of people in-situ. This is problematic because commonly-used bias metrics (such as Bias@K) rely on per-gender base rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel dataset debiasing pipeline to augment the COCO dataset with synthetic, gender-balanced contrast sets, where only the gender of the subject is edited and the background is fixed. However, existing image editing methods have limitations and sometimes produce low-quality images; so, we introduce a method to automatically filter the generated images based on their similarity to real images. Using our balanced synthetic contrast sets, we benchmark bias in multiple CLIP-based models, demonstrating how metrics are skewed by imbalance in the original COCO images. Our results indicate that the proposed approach improves the validity of the evaluation, ultimately contributing to more realistic understanding of bias in vision-language models.

**Title:** Towards Revealing the Mystery behind Chain of Thought: a Theoretical  Perspective  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15408  
**Abstract:** Recent studies have discovered that Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) can dramatically improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly when dealing with complex tasks involving mathematics or reasoning. Despite the enormous empirical success, the underlying mechanisms behind CoT and how it unlocks the potential of LLMs remain elusive. In this paper, we take a first step towards theoretically answering these questions. Specifically, we examine the capacity of LLMs with CoT in solving fundamental mathematical and decision-making problems. We start by giving an impossibility result showing that any bounded-depth Transformer cannot directly output correct answers for basic arithmetic/equation tasks unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, we then prove by construction that autoregressive Transformers of a constant size suffice to solve both tasks by generating CoT derivations using a commonly-used math language format. Moreover, we show LLMs with CoT are capable of solving a general class of decision-making problems known as Dynamic Programming, thus justifying its power in tackling complex real-world tasks. Finally, extensive experiments on four tasks show that, while Transformers always fail to predict the answers directly, they can consistently learn to generate correct solutions step-by-step given sufficient CoT demonstrations.

**Title:** Support for Stock Trend Prediction Using Transformers and Sentiment  Analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14368  
**Abstract:** Stock trend analysis has been an influential time-series prediction topic due to its lucrative and inherently chaotic nature. Many models looking to accurately predict the trend of stocks have been based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, due to the limitations of RNNs, such as gradient vanish and long-term dependencies being lost as sequence length increases, in this paper we develop a Transformer based model that uses technical stock data and sentiment analysis to conduct accurate stock trend prediction over long time windows. This paper also introduces a novel dataset containing daily technical stock data and top news headline data spanning almost three years. Stock prediction based solely on technical data can suffer from lag caused by the inability of stock indicators to effectively factor in breaking market news. The use of sentiment analysis on top headlines can help account for unforeseen shifts in market conditions caused by news coverage. We measure the performance of our model against RNNs over sequence lengths spanning 5 business days to 30 business days to mimic different length trading strategies. This reveals an improvement in directional accuracy over RNNs as sequence length is increased, with the largest improvement being close to 18.63% at 30 business days.

**Title:** A Survey on the Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Prediction and  Diagnosis of Schizophrenia  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14370  
**Abstract:** Machine learning is employed in healthcare to draw approximate conclusions regarding human diseases and mental health problems. Compared to older traditional methods, it can help to analyze data more efficiently and produce better and more dependable results. Millions of people are affected by schizophrenia, which is a chronic mental disorder that can significantly impact their lives. Many machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict and prevent this disease, and they can potentially be implemented in the diagnosis of individuals who have it. This survey aims to review papers that have focused on the use of deep learning to detect and predict schizophrenia using EEG signals, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). With our chosen search strategy, we assessed ten publications from 2019 to 2022. All studies achieved successful predictions of more than 80%. This review provides summaries of the studies and compares their notable aspects. In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for schizophrenia, significant advances have been made due to the availability of ML tools, and we are optimistic that this field will continue to grow.

**Title:** Stock and market index prediction using Informer network  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14382  
**Abstract:** Applications of deep learning in financial market prediction has attracted huge attention from investors and researchers. In particular, intra-day prediction at the minute scale, the dramatically fluctuating volume and stock prices within short time periods have posed a great challenge for the convergence of networks result. Informer is a more novel network, improved on Transformer with smaller computational complexity, longer prediction length and global time stamp features. We have designed three experiments to compare Informer with the commonly used networks LSTM, Transformer and BERT on 1-minute and 5-minute frequencies for four different stocks/ market indices. The prediction results are measured by three evaluation criteria: MAE, RMSE and MAPE. Informer has obtained best performance among all the networks on every dataset. Network without the global time stamp mechanism has significantly lower prediction effect compared to the complete Informer; it is evident that this mechanism grants the time series to the characteristics and substantially improves the prediction accuracy of the networks. Finally, transfer learning capability experiment is conducted, Informer also achieves a good performance. Informer has good robustness and improved performance in market prediction, which can be exactly adapted to real trading.

**Title:** Brain Structure-Function Fusing Representation Learning using  Adversarial Decomposed-VAE for Analyzing MCI  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14404  
**Abstract:** Integrating the brain structural and functional connectivity features is of great significance in both exploring brain science and analyzing cognitive impairment clinically. However, it remains a challenge to effectively fuse structural and functional features in exploring the brain network. In this paper, a novel brain structure-function fusing-representation learning (BSFL) model is proposed to effectively learn fused representation from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. Specifically, the decomposition-fusion framework is developed to first decompose the feature space into the union of the uniform and the unique spaces for each modality, and then adaptively fuse the decomposed features to learn MCI-related representation. Moreover, a knowledge-aware transformer module is designed to automatically capture local and global connectivity features throughout the brain. Also, a uniform-unique contrastive loss is further devised to make the decomposition more effective and enhance the complementarity of structural and functional features. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better performance than other competitive methods in predicting and analyzing MCI. More importantly, the proposed model could be a potential tool for reconstructing unified brain networks and predicting abnormal connections during the degenerative processes in MCI.

**Title:** Optimal Preconditioning and Fisher Adaptive Langevin Sampling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14442  
**Abstract:** We define an optimal preconditioning for the Langevin diffusion by analytically maximizing the expected squared jumped distance. This yields as the optimal preconditioning an inverse Fisher information covariance matrix, where the covariance matrix is computed as the outer product of log target gradients averaged under the target. We apply this result to the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and derive a computationally efficient adaptive MCMC scheme that learns the preconditioning from the history of gradients produced as the algorithm runs. We show in several experiments that the proposed algorithm is very robust in high dimensions and significantly outperforms other methods, including a closely related adaptive MALA scheme that learns the preconditioning with standard adaptive MCMC as well as the position-dependent Riemannian manifold MALA sampler.

**Title:** On the Transferability of Whisper-based Representations for  "In-the-Wild" Cross-Task Downstream Speech Applications  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14546  
**Abstract:** Large self-supervised pre-trained speech models have achieved remarkable success across various speech-processing tasks. The self-supervised training of these models leads to universal speech representations that can be used for different downstream tasks, ranging from automatic speech recognition (ASR) to speaker identification. Recently, Whisper, a transformer-based model was proposed and trained on large amount of weakly supervised data for ASR; it outperformed several state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Given the superiority of Whisper for ASR, in this paper we explore the transferability of the representation for four other speech tasks in SUPERB benchmark. Moreover, we explore the robustness of Whisper representation for ``in the wild'' tasks where speech is corrupted by environment noise and room reverberation. Experimental results show Whisper achieves promising results across tasks and environmental conditions, thus showing potential for cross-task real-world deployment.

**Title:** P-vectors: A Parallel-Coupled TDNN/Transformer Network for Speaker  Verification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14778  
**Abstract:** Typically, the Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) and Transformer can serve as a backbone for Speaker Verification (SV). Both of them have advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of global and local feature modeling. How to effectively integrate these two style features is still an open issue. In this paper, we explore a Parallel-coupled TDNN/Transformer Network (p-vectors) to replace the serial hybrid networks. The p-vectors allows TDNN and Transformer to learn the complementary information from each other through Soft Feature Alignment Interaction (SFAI) under the premise of preserving local and global features. Also, p-vectors uses the Spatial Frequency-channel Attention (SFA) to enhance the spatial interdependence modeling for input features. Finally, the outputs of dual branches of p-vectors are combined by Embedding Aggregation Layer (EAL). Experiments show that p-vectors outperforms MACCIF-TDNN and MFA-Conformer with relative improvements of 11.5% and 13.9% in EER on VoxCeleb1-O.

**Title:** Diffusion-Based Audio Inpainting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15266  
**Abstract:** Audio inpainting aims to reconstruct missing segments in corrupted recordings. Previous methods produce plausible reconstructions when the gap length is shorter than about 100\;ms, but the quality decreases for longer gaps. This paper explores recent advancements in deep learning and, particularly, diffusion models, for the task of audio inpainting. The proposed method uses an unconditionally trained generative model, which can be conditioned in a zero-shot fashion for audio inpainting, offering high flexibility to regenerate gaps of arbitrary length. An improved deep neural network architecture based on the constant-Q transform, which allows the model to exploit pitch-equivariant symmetries in audio, is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through objective and subjective metrics for the task of reconstructing short to mid-sized gaps. The results of a formal listening test show that the proposed method delivers a comparable performance against state-of-the-art for short gaps, while retaining a good audio quality and outperforming the baselines for the longest gap lengths tested, 150\;ms and 200\;ms. This work helps improve the restoration of sound recordings having fairly long local disturbances or dropouts, which must be reconstructed.

**Title:** Solving Diffusion ODEs with Optimal Boundary Conditions for Better Image  Super-Resolution  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15357  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models, as a kind of powerful generative model, have given impressive results on image super-resolution (SR) tasks. However, due to the randomness introduced in the reverse process of diffusion models, the performances of diffusion-based SR models are fluctuating at every time of sampling, especially for samplers with few resampled steps. This inherent randomness of diffusion models results in ineffectiveness and instability, making it challenging for users to guarantee the quality of SR results. However, our work takes this randomness as an opportunity: fully analyzing and leveraging it leads to the construction of an effective plug-and-play sampling method that owns the potential to benefit a series of diffusion-based SR methods. More in detail, we propose to steadily sample high-quality SR images from pretrained diffusion-based SR models by solving diffusion ordinary differential equations (diffusion ODEs) with optimal boundary conditions (BCs) and analyze the characteristics between the choices of BCs and their corresponding SR results. Our analysis shows the route to obtain an approximately optimal BC via an efficient exploration in the whole space. The quality of SR results sampled by the proposed method with fewer steps outperforms the quality of results sampled by current methods with randomness from the same pretrained diffusion-based SR model, which means that our sampling method ``boosts'' current diffusion-based SR models without any additional training.
