**Title:** Large language models in biomedical natural language processing:  benchmarks, baselines, and recommendations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16326  
**Abstract:** Biomedical literature is growing rapidly, making it challenging to curate and extract knowledge manually. Biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) techniques that can automatically extract information from biomedical literature help alleviate this burden. Recently, large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, have gained significant attention for their impressive performance. However, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks and impact on method development and downstream users remain understudied. This pilot study (1) establishes the baseline performance of GPT-3 and GPT-4 at both zero-shot and one-shot settings in eight BioNLP datasets across four applications: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, and semantic similarity and reasoning, (2) examines the errors produced by the LLMs and categorized the errors into three types: missingness, inconsistencies, and unwanted artificial content, and (3) provides suggestions for using LLMs in BioNLP applications. We make the datasets, baselines, and results publicly available to the community via https://github.com/qingyu-qc/gpt_bionlp_benchmark.

**Title:** Handling Realistic Label Noise in BERT Text Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16337  
**Abstract:** Labels noise refers to errors in training labels caused by cheap data annotation methods, such as web scraping or crowd-sourcing, which can be detrimental to the performance of supervised classifiers. Several methods have been proposed to counteract the effect of random label noise in supervised classification, and some studies have shown that BERT is already robust against high rates of randomly injected label noise. However, real label noise is not random; rather, it is often correlated with input features or other annotator-specific factors. In this paper, we evaluate BERT in the presence of two types of realistic label noise: feature-dependent label noise, and synthetic label noise from annotator disagreements. We show that the presence of these types of noise significantly degrades BERT classification performance. To improve robustness, we evaluate different types of ensembles and noise-cleaning methods and compare their effectiveness against label noise across different datasets.

**Title:** Don't Trust GPT When Your Question Is Not In English  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16339  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding abilities and have excelled in a variety of natural language processing (NLP)tasks in recent years. Despite the fact that most LLMs are trained predominantly in English, multiple studies have demonstrated their comparative performance in many other languages. However, fundamental questions persist regarding how LLMs acquire their multi-lingual abilities and how performance varies across different languages. These inquiries are crucial for the study of LLMs since users and researchers often come from diverse language backgrounds, potentially influencing their utilization and interpretation of LLMs' results. In this work, we propose a systematic way of qualifying the performance disparities of LLMs under multilingual settings. We investigate the phenomenon of across-language generalizations in LLMs, wherein insufficient multi-lingual training data leads to advanced multi-lingual capabilities. To accomplish this, we employ a novel back-translation-based prompting method. The results show that GPT exhibits highly translating-like behaviour in multilingual settings.

**Title:** Segmented Recurrent Transformer: An Efficient Sequence-to-Sequence Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16340  
**Abstract:** Transformers have shown dominant performance across a range of domains including language and vision. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with the sequence length, making their usage prohibitive for resource-constrained applications. To counter this, our approach is to divide the whole sequence into segments. The information across segments can then be aggregated using neurons with recurrence leveraging their inherent memory. Such an approach leads to models with sequential processing capability at a lower computation/memory cost. To investigate this idea, first, we examine the effects of using local attention mechanism on the individual segments. Then we propose a segmented recurrent transformer (SRformer) that combines segmented attention with recurrent attention. It uses recurrent accumulate and fire (RAF) layers to process information between consecutive segments. The loss caused by reducing the attention window length is compensated by updating the product of keys and values with RAF neurons' inherent recurrence. The segmented attention and lightweight RAF gates ensure the efficiency of the proposed transformer. We apply the proposed method to T5 and BART transformers. The modified models are tested on summarization datasets including CNN-dailymail and XSUM. Notably, using segmented inputs of different sizes, the proposed model achieves 4-19% higher ROUGE1 scores than the segmented transformer baseline. Compared to full attention, the proposed model largely reduces the complexity of cross attention and results in around 40% reduction in computation cost.

**Title:** InterFormer: Interactive Local and Global Features Fusion for Automatic  Speech Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16342  
**Abstract:** The local and global features are both essential for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Many recent methods have verified that simply combining local and global features can further promote ASR performance. However, these methods pay less attention to the interaction of local and global features, and their series architectures are rigid to reflect local and global relationships. To address these issues, this paper proposes InterFormer for interactive local and global features fusion to learn a better representation for ASR. Specifically, we combine the convolution block with the transformer block in a parallel design. Besides, we propose a bidirectional feature interaction module (BFIM) and a selective fusion module (SFM) to implement the interaction and fusion of local and global features, respectively. Extensive experiments on public ASR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed InterFormer and its superior performance over the other Transformer and Conformer models.

**Title:** Leveraging LLMs for KPIs Retrieval from Hybrid Long-Document: A  Comprehensive Framework and Dataset  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16344  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in textual understanding and tabular reasoning tasks. However, their ability to comprehend and analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains underexplored. In this research, we specialize in harnessing the potential of LLMs to comprehend critical information from financial reports, which are hybrid long-documents. We propose an Automated Financial Information Extraction (AFIE) framework that enhances LLMs' ability to comprehend and extract information from financial reports. To evaluate AFIE, we develop a Financial Reports Numerical Extraction (FINE) dataset and conduct an extensive experimental analysis. Our framework is effectively validated on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, yielding average accuracy increases of 53.94% and 33.77%, respectively, compared to a naive method. These results suggest that the AFIE framework offers accuracy for automated numerical extraction from complex, hybrid documents.

**Title:** Machine learning-based characterization of hydrochar from biomass:  Implications for sustainable energy and material production  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16348  
**Abstract:** Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a process that converts biomass into versatile hydrochar without the need for prior drying. The physicochemical properties of hydrochar are influenced by biomass properties and processing parameters, making it challenging to optimize for specific applications through trial-and-error experiments. To save time and money, machine learning can be used to develop a model that characterizes hydrochar produced from different biomass sources under varying reaction processing parameters. Thus, this study aims to develop an inclusive model to characterize hydrochar using a database covering a range of biomass types and reaction processing parameters. The quality and quantity of hydrochar are predicted using two models (decision tree regression and support vector regression). The decision tree regression model outperforms the support vector regression model in terms of forecast accuracy (R2 > 0.88, RMSE < 6.848, and MAE < 4.718). Using an evolutionary algorithm, optimum inputs are identified based on cost functions provided by the selected model to optimize hydrochar for energy production, soil amendment, and pollutant adsorption, resulting in hydrochar yields of 84.31%, 84.91%, and 80.40%, respectively. The feature importance analysis reveals that biomass ash/carbon content and operating temperature are the primary factors affecting hydrochar production in the HTC process.

**Title:** Using evolutionary machine learning to characterize and optimize  co-pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks and polymeric wastes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16350  
**Abstract:** Co-pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks with polymeric wastes is a promising strategy for improving the quantity and quality parameters of the resulting liquid fuel. Numerous experimental measurements are typically conducted to find the optimal operating conditions. However, performing co-pyrolysis experiments is highly challenging due to the need for costly and lengthy procedures. Machine learning (ML) provides capabilities to cope with such issues by leveraging on existing data. This work aims to introduce an evolutionary ML approach to quantify the (by)products of the biomass-polymer co-pyrolysis process. A comprehensive dataset covering various biomass-polymer mixtures under a broad range of process conditions is compiled from the qualified literature. The database was subjected to statistical analysis and mechanistic discussion. The input features are constructed using an innovative approach to reflect the physics of the process. The constructed features are subjected to principal component analysis to reduce their dimensionality. The obtained scores are introduced into six ML models. Gaussian process regression model tuned by particle swarm optimization algorithm presents better prediction performance (R2 > 0.9, MAE < 0.03, and RMSE < 0.06) than other developed models. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm successfully finds optimal independent parameters.

**Title:** Ensemble Synthetic EHR Generation for Increasing Subpopulation Model's  Performance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16363  
**Abstract:** Electronic health records (EHR) often contain different rates of representation of certain subpopulations (SP). Factors like patient demographics, clinical condition prevalence, and medical center type contribute to this underrepresentation. Consequently, when training machine learning models on such datasets, the models struggle to generalize well and perform poorly on underrepresented SPs. To address this issue, we propose a novel ensemble framework that utilizes generative models. Specifically, we train a GAN-based synthetic data generator for each SP and incorporate synthetic samples into each SP training set. Ultimately, we train SP-specific prediction models. To properly evaluate this method, we design an evaluation pipeline with 2 real-world use case datasets, queried from the MIMIC database. Our approach shows increased model performance over underrepresented SPs. Our code and models are given as supplementary and will be made available on a public repository.

**Title:** Decomposing the Enigma: Subgoal-based Demonstration Learning for Formal  Theorem Proving  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16366  
**Abstract:** Large language models~(LLMs) present an intriguing avenue of exploration in the domain of formal theorem proving. Nonetheless, the full utilization of these models, particularly in terms of demonstration formatting and organization, remains an underexplored area. In an endeavor to enhance the efficacy of LLMs, we introduce a subgoal-based demonstration learning framework, consisting of two primary elements: Firstly, drawing upon the insights of subgoal learning from the domains of reinforcement learning and robotics, we propose the construction of distinct subgoals for each demonstration example and refine these subgoals in accordance with the pertinent theories of subgoal learning. Secondly, we build upon recent advances in diffusion models to predict the optimal organization, simultaneously addressing two intricate issues that persist within the domain of demonstration organization: subset selection and order determination. Through the integration of subgoal-based learning methodologies, we have successfully increased the prevailing proof accuracy from 38.9\% to 44.3\% on the miniF2F benchmark. Furthermore, the adoption of diffusion models for demonstration organization can lead to an additional enhancement in accuracy to 45.5\%, or a $5\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared with the long-standing state-of-the-art method. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/HKUNLP/subgoal-theorem-prover}.

**Title:** Stecformer: Spatio-temporal Encoding Cascaded Transformer for  Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16370  
**Abstract:** Multivariate long-term time series forecasting is of great application across many domains, such as energy consumption and weather forecasting. With the development of transformer-based methods, the performance of multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been significantly improved, however, the study of spatial features extracting in transformer-based model is rare and the consistency of different prediction periods is unsatisfactory due to the large span. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of feature extraction and target prediction. For extraction, we design an efficient spatio-temporal encoding extractor including a semi-adaptive graph to acquire sufficient spatio-temporal information. For prediction, we propose a Cascaded Decoding Predictor (CDP) to strengthen the correlation between different intervals, which can also be utilized as a generic component to improve the performance of transformer-based methods. The proposed method, termed as Spatio-temporal Encoding Cascaded Transformer (Stecformer), achieving a notable gap over the baseline model and is comparable with the state-of-the-art performance of transformer-based methods on five benchmark datasets. We hope our attempt will serve as a regular configuration in multivariate long-term time series forecasting in the future.

**Title:** Scan and Snap: Understanding Training Dynamics and Token Composition in  1-layer Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16380  
**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has shown impressive performance in multiple research domains and has become the backbone of many neural network models. However, there is limited understanding on how it works. In particular, with a simple predictive loss, how the representation emerges from the gradient \emph{training dynamics} remains a mystery. In this paper, for 1-layer transformer with one self-attention layer plus one decoder layer, we analyze its SGD training dynamics for the task of next token prediction in a mathematically rigorous manner. We open the black box of the dynamic process of how the self-attention layer combines input tokens, and reveal the nature of underlying inductive bias. More specifically, with the assumption (a) no positional encoding, (b) long input sequence, and (c) the decoder layer learns faster than the self-attention layer, we prove that self-attention acts as a \emph{discriminative scanning algorithm}: starting from uniform attention, it gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across different next tokens. Among distinct tokens, it progressively drops attention weights, following the order of low to high co-occurrence between the key and the query token in the training set. Interestingly, this procedure does not lead to winner-takes-all, but decelerates due to a \emph{phase transition} that is controllable by the learning rates of the two layers, leaving (almost) fixed token combination. We verify this \textbf{\emph{scan and snap}} dynamics on synthetic and real-world data (WikiText).

**Title:** DPOK: Reinforcement Learning for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16381  
**Abstract:** Learning from human feedback has been shown to improve text-to-image models. These techniques first learn a reward function that captures what humans care about in the task and then improve the models based on the learned reward function. Even though relatively simple approaches (e.g., rejection sampling based on reward scores) have been investigated, fine-tuning text-to-image models with the reward function remains challenging. In this work, we propose using online reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image models. We focus on diffusion models, defining the fine-tuning task as an RL problem, and updating the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using policy gradient to maximize the feedback-trained reward. Our approach, coined DPOK, integrates policy optimization with KL regularization. We conduct an analysis of KL regularization for both RL fine-tuning and supervised fine-tuning. In our experiments, we show that DPOK is generally superior to supervised fine-tuning with respect to both image-text alignment and image quality.

**Title:** Are Diffusion Models Vision-And-Language Reasoners?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16397  
**Abstract:** Text-conditioned image generation models have recently shown immense qualitative success using denoising diffusion processes. However, unlike discriminative vision-and-language models, it is a non-trivial task to subject these diffusion-based generative models to automatic fine-grained quantitative evaluation of high-level phenomena such as compositionality. Towards this goal, we perform two innovations. First, we transform diffusion-based models (in our case, Stable Diffusion) for any image-text matching (ITM) task using a novel method called DiffusionITM. Second, we introduce the Generative-Discriminative Evaluation Benchmark (GDBench) benchmark with 7 complex vision-and-language tasks, bias evaluation and detailed analysis. We find that Stable Diffusion + DiffusionITM is competitive on many tasks and outperforms CLIP on compositional tasks like like CLEVR and Winoground. We further boost its compositional performance with a transfer setup by fine-tuning on MS-COCO while retaining generative capabilities. We also measure the stereotypical bias in diffusion models, and find that Stable Diffusion 2.1 is, for the most part, less biased than Stable Diffusion 1.5. Overall, our results point in an exciting direction bringing discriminative and generative model evaluation closer. We will release code and benchmark setup soon.

**Title:** Context-Aware Attention Layers coupled with Optimal Transport Domain  Adaptation methods for recognizing dementia from spontaneous speech  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16406  
**Abstract:** Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a complex neurocognitive disease and is the main cause of dementia. Although many studies have been proposed targeting at diagnosing dementia through spontaneous speech, there are still limitations. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, which propose multimodal methods, train separately language and acoustic models, employ majority-vote approaches, and concatenate the representations of the different modalities either at the input level, i.e., early fusion, or during training. Also, some of them employ self-attention layers, which calculate the dependencies between representations without considering the contextual information. In addition, no prior work has taken into consideration the model calibration. To address these limitations, we propose some new methods for detecting AD patients, which capture the intra- and cross-modal interactions. First, we convert the audio files into log-Mel spectrograms, their delta, and delta-delta and create in this way an image per audio file consisting of three channels. Next, we pass each transcript and image through BERT and DeiT models respectively. After that, context-based self-attention layers, self-attention layers with a gate model, and optimal transport domain adaptation methods are employed for capturing the intra- and inter-modal interactions. Finally, we exploit two methods for fusing the self and cross-attended features. For taking into account the model calibration, we apply label smoothing. We use both performance and calibration metrics. Experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate the efficacy of our introduced approaches over existing research initiatives with our best performing model reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 91.25% and 91.06% respectively.

**Title:** Script Normalization for Unconventional Writing of Under-Resourced  Languages in Bilingual Communities  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16407  
**Abstract:** The wide accessibility of social media has provided linguistically under-represented communities with an extraordinary opportunity to create content in their native languages. This, however, comes with certain challenges in script normalization, particularly where the speakers of a language in a bilingual community rely on another script or orthography to write their native language. This paper addresses the problem of script normalization for several such languages that are mainly written in a Perso-Arabic script. Using synthetic data with various levels of noise and a transformer-based model, we demonstrate that the problem can be effectively remediated. We conduct a small-scale evaluation of real data as well. Our experiments indicate that script normalization is also beneficial to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as machine translation and language identification.

**Title:** ZeroAvatar: Zero-shot 3D Avatar Generation from a Single Image  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16411  
**Abstract:** Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have enabled significant progress in zero-shot 3D shape generation. This is achieved by score distillation, a methodology that uses pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to optimize the parameters of a 3D neural presentation, e.g. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). While showing promising results, existing methods are often not able to preserve the geometry of complex shapes, such as human bodies. To address this challenge, we present ZeroAvatar, a method that introduces the explicit 3D human body prior to the optimization process. Specifically, we first estimate and refine the parameters of a parametric human body from a single image. Then during optimization, we use the posed parametric body as additional geometry constraint to regularize the diffusion model as well as the underlying density field. Lastly, we propose a UV-guided texture regularization term to further guide the completion of texture on invisible body parts. We show that ZeroAvatar significantly enhances the robustness and 3D consistency of optimization-based image-to-3D avatar generation, outperforming existing zero-shot image-to-3D methods.

**Title:** Not wacky vs. definitely wacky: A study of scalar adverbs in pretrained  language models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16426  
**Abstract:** Vector space models of word meaning all share the assumption that words occurring in similar contexts have similar meanings. In such models, words that are similar in their topical associations but differ in their logical force tend to emerge as semantically close, creating well-known challenges for NLP applications that involve logical reasoning. Modern pretrained language models, such as BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-3 hold the promise of performing better on logical tasks than classic static word embeddings. However, reports are mixed about their success. In the current paper, we advance this discussion through a systematic study of scalar adverbs, an under-explored class of words with strong logical force. Using three different tasks, involving both naturalistic social media data and constructed examples, we investigate the extent to which BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 and GPT-3 exhibit general, human-like, knowledge of these common words. We ask: 1) Do the models distinguish amongst the three semantic categories of MODALITY, FREQUENCY and DEGREE? 2) Do they have implicit representations of full scales from maximally negative to maximally positive? 3) How do word frequency and contextual factors impact model performance? We find that despite capturing some aspects of logical meaning, the models fall far short of human performance.

**Title:** Too Few Bug Reports? Exploring Data Augmentation for Improved  Changeset-based Bug Localization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16430  
**Abstract:** Modern Deep Learning (DL) architectures based on transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) are exhibiting performance improvements across a number of natural language tasks. While such DL models have shown tremendous potential for use in software engineering applications, they are often hampered by insufficient training data. Particularly constrained are applications that require project-specific data, such as bug localization, which aims at recommending code to fix a newly submitted bug report. Deep learning models for bug localization require a substantial training set of fixed bug reports, which are at a limited quantity even in popular and actively developed software projects. In this paper, we examine the effect of using synthetic training data on transformer-based DL models that perform a more complex variant of bug localization, which has the goal of retrieving bug-inducing changesets for each bug report. To generate high-quality synthetic data, we propose novel data augmentation operators that act on different constituent components of bug reports. We also describe a data balancing strategy that aims to create a corpus of augmented bug reports that better reflects the entire source code base, because existing bug reports used as training data usually reference a small part of the code base.

**Title:** Neural Machine Translation for Mathematical Formulae  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16433  
**Abstract:** We tackle the problem of neural machine translation of mathematical formulae between ambiguous presentation languages and unambiguous content languages. Compared to neural machine translation on natural language, mathematical formulae have a much smaller vocabulary and much longer sequences of symbols, while their translation requires extreme precision to satisfy mathematical information needs. In this work, we perform the tasks of translating from LaTeX to Mathematica as well as from LaTeX to semantic LaTeX. While recurrent, recursive, and transformer networks struggle with preserving all contained information, we find that convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks achieve 95.1% and 90.7% exact matches, respectively.

**Title:** EgoHumans: An Egocentric 3D Multi-Human Benchmark  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16487  
**Abstract:** We present EgoHumans, a new multi-view multi-human video benchmark to advance the state-of-the-art of egocentric human 3D pose estimation and tracking. Existing egocentric benchmarks either capture single subject or indoor-only scenarios, which limit the generalization of computer vision algorithms for real-world applications. We propose a novel 3D capture setup to construct a comprehensive egocentric multi-human benchmark in the wild with annotations to support diverse tasks such as human detection, tracking, 2D/3D pose estimation, and mesh recovery. We leverage consumer-grade wearable camera-equipped glasses for the egocentric view, which enables us to capture dynamic activities like playing soccer, fencing, volleyball, etc. Furthermore, our multi-view setup generates accurate 3D ground truth even under severe or complete occlusion. The dataset consists of more than 125k egocentric images, spanning diverse scenes with a particular focus on challenging and unchoreographed multi-human activities and fast-moving egocentric views. We rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods and highlight their limitations in the egocentric scenario, specifically on multi-human tracking. To address such limitations, we propose EgoFormer, a novel approach with a multi-stream transformer architecture and explicit 3D spatial reasoning to estimate and track the human pose. EgoFormer significantly outperforms prior art by 13.6% IDF1 and 9.3 HOTA on the EgoHumans dataset.

**Title:** Diffusion-Based Adversarial Sample Generation for Improved Stealthiness  and Controllability  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16494  
**Abstract:** Neural networks are known to be susceptible to adversarial samples: small variations of natural examples crafted to deliberately mislead the models. While they can be easily generated using gradient-based techniques in digital and physical scenarios, they often differ greatly from the actual data distribution of natural images, resulting in a trade-off between strength and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework dubbed Diffusion-Based Projected Gradient Descent (Diff-PGD) for generating realistic adversarial samples. By exploiting a gradient guided by a diffusion model, Diff-PGD ensures that adversarial samples remain close to the original data distribution while maintaining their effectiveness. Moreover, our framework can be easily customized for specific tasks such as digital attacks, physical-world attacks, and style-based attacks. Compared with existing methods for generating natural-style adversarial samples, our framework enables the separation of optimizing adversarial loss from other surrogate losses (e.g., content/smoothness/style loss), making it more stable and controllable. Finally, we demonstrate that the samples generated using Diff-PGD have better transferability and anti-purification power than traditional gradient-based methods. Code will be released in https://github.com/xavihart/Diff-PGD

**Title:** IMBERT: Making BERT Immune to Insertion-based Backdoor Attacks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16503  
**Abstract:** Backdoor attacks are an insidious security threat against machine learning models. Adversaries can manipulate the predictions of compromised models by inserting triggers into the training phase. Various backdoor attacks have been devised which can achieve nearly perfect attack success without affecting model predictions for clean inputs. Means of mitigating such vulnerabilities are underdeveloped, especially in natural language processing. To fill this gap, we introduce IMBERT, which uses either gradients or self-attention scores derived from victim models to self-defend against backdoor attacks at inference time. Our empirical studies demonstrate that IMBERT can effectively identify up to 98.5% of inserted triggers. Thus, it significantly reduces the attack success rate while attaining competitive accuracy on the clean dataset across widespread insertion-based attacks compared to two baselines. Finally, we show that our approach is model-agnostic, and can be easily ported to several pre-trained transformer models.

**Title:** On the Tool Manipulation Capability of Open-source Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16504  
**Abstract:** Recent studies on software tool manipulation with large language models (LLMs) mostly rely on closed model APIs. The industrial adoption of these models is substantially constrained due to the security and robustness risks in exposing information to closed LLM API services. In this paper, we ask can we enhance open-source LLMs to be competitive to leading closed LLM APIs in tool manipulation, with practical amount of human supervision. By analyzing common tool manipulation failures, we first demonstrate that open-source LLMs may require training with usage examples, in-context demonstration and generation style regulation to resolve failures. These insights motivate us to revisit classical methods in LLM literature, and demonstrate that we can adapt them as model alignment with programmatic data generation, system prompts and in-context demonstration retrievers to enhance open-source LLMs for tool manipulation. To evaluate these techniques, we create the ToolBench, a tool manipulation benchmark consisting of diverse software tools for real-world tasks. We demonstrate that our techniques can boost leading open-source LLMs by up to 90% success rate, showing capabilities competitive to OpenAI GPT-4 in 4 out of 8 ToolBench tasks. We show that such enhancement typically requires about one developer day to curate data for each tool, rendering a recipe with practical amount of human supervision.

**Title:** Comparing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM Deep  Neural Networks for power consumption prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16546  
**Abstract:** Electric consumption prediction methods are investigated for many reasons such as decision-making related to energy efficiency as well as for anticipating demand in the energy market dynamics. The objective of the present work is the comparison between two Deep Learning models, namely the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bi-directional LSTM (BLSTM) for univariate electric consumption Time Series (TS) short-term forecast. The Data Sets (DSs) were selected for their different contexts and scales, aiming the assessment of the models' robustness. Four DSs were used, related to the power consumption of: (a) a household in France; (b) a university building in Santar\'em, Brazil; (c) the T\'etouan city zones, in Morocco; and (c) the Singapore aggregated electric demand. The metrics RMSE, MAE, MAPE and R2 were calculated in a TS cross-validation scheme. The Friedman's test was applied to normalized RMSE (NRMSE) results, showing that BLSTM outperforms LSTM with statistically significant difference (p = 0.0455), corroborating the fact that bidirectional weight updating improves significantly the LSTM performance concerning different scales of electric power consumption.

**Title:** Emergent Agentic Transformer from Chain of Hindsight Experience  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16554  
**Abstract:** Large transformer models powered by diverse data and model scale have dominated natural language modeling and computer vision and pushed the frontier of multiple AI areas. In reinforcement learning (RL), despite many efforts into transformer-based policies, a key limitation, however, is that current transformer-based policies cannot learn by directly combining information from multiple sub-optimal trials. In this work, we address this issue using recently proposed chain of hindsight to relabel experience, where we train a transformer on a sequence of trajectory experience ascending sorted according to their total rewards. Our method consists of relabelling target return of each trajectory to the maximum total reward among in sequence of trajectories and training an autoregressive model to predict actions conditioning on past states, actions, rewards, target returns, and task completion tokens, the resulting model, Agentic Transformer (AT), can learn to improve upon itself both at training and test time. As we show on D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks, to the best our knowledge, this is the first time that a simple transformer-based model performs competitively with both temporal-difference and imitation-learning-based approaches, even from sub-optimal data. Our Agentic Transformer also shows a promising scaling trend that bigger models consistently improve results.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16572  
**Abstract:** Current pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded on the understanding of real world. We tease these factors apart by leveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set of tests from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale controlled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from five pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however, we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this sensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.

**Title:** A Multi-Scale Attentive Transformer for Multi-Instrument Symbolic Music  Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16592  
**Abstract:** Recently, multi-instrument music generation has become a hot topic. Different from single-instrument generation, multi-instrument generation needs to consider inter-track harmony besides intra-track coherence. This is usually achieved by composing note segments from different instruments into a signal sequence. This composition could be on different scales, such as note, bar, or track. Most existing work focuses on a particular scale, leading to a shortage in modeling music with diverse temporal and track dependencies.

**Title:** NormMark: A Weakly Supervised Markov Model for Socio-cultural Norm  Discovery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16598  
**Abstract:** Norms, which are culturally accepted guidelines for behaviours, can be integrated into conversational models to generate utterances that are appropriate for the socio-cultural context. Existing methods for norm recognition tend to focus only on surface-level features of dialogues and do not take into account the interactions within a conversation. To address this issue, we propose NormMark, a probabilistic generative Markov model to carry the latent features throughout a dialogue. These features are captured by discrete and continuous latent variables conditioned on the conversation history, and improve the model's ability in norm recognition. The model is trainable on weakly annotated data using the variational technique. On a dataset with limited norm annotations, we show that our approach achieves higher F1 score, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods, including GPT3.

**Title:** Spatio-Temporal Transformer-Based Reinforcement Learning for Robot Crowd  Navigation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16612  
**Abstract:** The social robot navigation is an open and challenging problem. In existing work, separate modules are used to capture spatial and temporal features, respectively. However, such methods lead to extra difficulties in improving the utilization of spatio-temporal features and reducing the conservative nature of navigation policy. In light of this, we present a spatio-temporal transformer-based policy optimization algorithm to enhance the utilization of spatio-temporal features, thereby facilitating the capture of human-robot interactions. Specifically, this paper introduces a gated embedding mechanism that effectively aligns the spatial and temporal representations by integrating both modalities at the feature level. Then Transformer is leveraged to encode the spatio-temporal semantic information, with hope of finding the optimal navigation policy. Finally, a combination of spatio-temporal Transformer and self-adjusting policy entropy significantly reduces the conservatism of navigation policies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, where our method shows superior performance.

**Title:** AIBugHunter: A Practical Tool for Predicting, Classifying and Repairing  Software Vulnerabilities  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16615  
**Abstract:** Many ML-based approaches have been proposed to automatically detect, localize, and repair software vulnerabilities. While ML-based methods are more effective than program analysis-based vulnerability analysis tools, few have been integrated into modern IDEs, hindering practical adoption. To bridge this critical gap, we propose AIBugHunter, a novel ML-based software vulnerability analysis tool for C/C++ languages that is integrated into Visual Studio Code. AIBugHunter helps software developers to achieve real-time vulnerability detection, explanation, and repairs during programming. In particular, AIBugHunter scans through developers' source code to (1) locate vulnerabilities, (2) identify vulnerability types, (3) estimate vulnerability severity, and (4) suggest vulnerability repairs. In this article, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based vulnerability classification approach and a transformer-based estimation approach to help AIBugHunter accurately identify vulnerability types and estimate severity. Our empirical experiments on a large dataset consisting of 188K+ C/C++ functions confirm that our proposed approaches are more accurate than other state-of-the-art baseline methods for vulnerability classification and estimation. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative evaluations including a survey study and a user study to obtain software practitioners' perceptions of our AIBugHunter tool and assess the impact that AIBugHunter may have on developers' productivity in security aspects. Our survey study shows that our AIBugHunter is perceived as useful where 90% of the participants consider adopting our AIBugHunter. Last but not least, our user study shows that our AIBugHunter could possibly enhance developers' productivity in combating cybersecurity issues during software development.

**Title:** Confidence-Based Feature Imputation for Graphs with Partially Known  Features  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16618  
**Abstract:** This paper investigates a missing feature imputation problem for graph learning tasks. Several methods have previously addressed learning tasks on graphs with missing features. However, in cases of high rates of missing features, they were unable to avoid significant performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature of a node for reflecting certainty of the imputation. We then design pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g., 99.5\%) and it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/daehoum1/pcfi}.

**Title:** Evaluation of Question Generation Needs More References  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16626  
**Abstract:** Question generation (QG) is the task of generating a valid and fluent question based on a given context and the target answer. According to various purposes, even given the same context, instructors can ask questions about different concepts, and even the same concept can be written in different ways. However, the evaluation for QG usually depends on single reference-based similarity metrics, such as n-gram-based metric or learned metric, which is not sufficient to fully evaluate the potential of QG methods. To this end, we propose to paraphrase the reference question for a more robust QG evaluation. Using large language models such as GPT-3, we created semantically and syntactically diverse questions, then adopt the simple aggregation of the popular evaluation metrics as the final scores. Through our experiments, we found that using multiple (pseudo) references is more effective for QG evaluation while showing a higher correlation with human evaluations than evaluation with a single reference.

**Title:** Zero is Not Hero Yet: Benchmarking Zero-Shot Performance of LLMs for  Financial Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16633  
**Abstract:** Recently large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on many natural language processing tasks with zero-shot. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of zero-shot LLMs in the financial domain. We compare the performance of ChatGPT along with some open-source generative LLMs in zero-shot mode with RoBERTa fine-tuned on annotated data. We address three inter-related research questions on data annotation, performance gaps, and the feasibility of employing generative models in the finance domain. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT performs well even without labeled data but fine-tuned models generally outperform it. Our research also highlights how annotating with generative models can be time-intensive. Our codebase is publicly available on GitHub under CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

**Title:** Impossible Distillation: from Low-Quality Model to High-Quality Dataset  & Model for Summarization and Paraphrasing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16635  
**Abstract:** It is commonly perceived that the strongest language models (LMs) rely on a combination of massive scale, instruction data, and human feedback to perform specialized tasks -- e.g. summarization and paraphrasing, without supervision. In this paper, we propose that language models can learn to summarize and paraphrase sentences, with none of these 3 factors. We present Impossible Distillation, a framework that distills a task-specific dataset directly from an off-the-shelf LM, even when it is impossible for the LM itself to reliably solve the task. By training a student model on the generated dataset and amplifying its capability through self-distillation, our method yields a high-quality model and dataset from a low-quality teacher model, without the need for scale or supervision. Using Impossible Distillation, we are able to distill an order of magnitude smaller model (with only 770M parameters) that outperforms 175B parameter GPT-3, in both quality and controllability, as confirmed by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, as a useful byproduct of our approach, we obtain DIMSUM+, a high-quality dataset with 3.4M sentence summaries and paraphrases. Our analyses show that this dataset, as a purely LM-generated corpus, is more diverse and more effective for generalization to unseen domains than all human-authored datasets -- including Gigaword with 4M samples.

**Title:** Improving Position Encoding of Transformers for Multivariate Time Series  Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16642  
**Abstract:** Transformers have demonstrated outstanding performance in many applications of deep learning. When applied to time series data, transformers require effective position encoding to capture the ordering of the time series data. The efficacy of position encoding in time series analysis is not well-studied and remains controversial, e.g., whether it is better to inject absolute position encoding or relative position encoding, or a combination of them. In order to clarify this, we first review existing absolute and relative position encoding methods when applied in time series classification. We then proposed a new absolute position encoding method dedicated to time series data called time Absolute Position Encoding (tAPE). Our new method incorporates the series length and input embedding dimension in absolute position encoding. Additionally, we propose computationally Efficient implementation of Relative Position Encoding (eRPE) to improve generalisability for time series. We then propose a novel multivariate time series classification (MTSC) model combining tAPE/eRPE and convolution-based input encoding named ConvTran to improve the position and data embedding of time series data. The proposed absolute and relative position encoding methods are simple and efficient. They can be easily integrated into transformer blocks and used for downstream tasks such as forecasting, extrinsic regression, and anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on 32 multivariate time-series datasets show that our model is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art convolution and transformer-based models. Code and models are open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/Navidfoumani/ConvTran}.

**Title:** Higher Order Gauge Equivariant CNNs on Riemannian Manifolds and  Applications  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16657  
**Abstract:** With the advent of group equivariant convolutions in deep networks literature, spherical CNNs with $\mathsf{SO}(3)$-equivariant layers have been developed to cope with data that are samples of signals on the sphere $S^2$. One can implicitly obtain $\mathsf{SO}(3)$-equivariant convolutions on $S^2$ with significant efficiency gains by explicitly requiring gauge equivariance w.r.t. $\mathsf{SO}(2)$. In this paper, we build on this fact by introducing a higher order generalization of the gauge equivariant convolution, whose implementation is dubbed a gauge equivariant Volterra network (GEVNet). This allows us to model spatially extended nonlinear interactions within a given receptive field while still maintaining equivariance to global isometries. We prove theoretical results regarding the equivariance and construction of higher order gauge equivariant convolutions. Then, we empirically demonstrate the parameter efficiency of our model, first on computer vision benchmark data (e.g. spherical MNIST), and then in combination with a convolutional kernel network (CKN) on neuroimaging data. In the neuroimaging data experiments, the resulting two-part architecture (CKN + GEVNet) is used to automatically discriminate between patients with Lewy Body Disease (DLB), Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) from diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI). The GEVNet extracts micro-architectural features within each voxel, while the CKN extracts macro-architectural features across voxels. This compound architecture is uniquely poised to exploit the intra- and inter-voxel information contained in the dMRI data, leading to improved performance over the classification results obtained from either of the individual components.

**Title:** Automated Summarization of Stack Overflow Posts  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16680  
**Abstract:** Software developers often resort to Stack Overflow (SO) to fill their programming needs. Given the abundance of relevant posts, navigating them and comparing different solutions is tedious and time-consuming. Recent work has proposed to automatically summarize SO posts to concise text to facilitate the navigation of SO posts. However, these techniques rely only on information retrieval methods or heuristics for text summarization, which is insufficient to handle the ambiguity and sophistication of natural language. This paper presents a deep learning based framework called ASSORT for SO post summarization. ASSORT includes two complementary learning methods, ASSORT_S and ASSORT_{IS}, to address the lack of labeled training data for SO post summarization. ASSORT_S is designed to directly train a novel ensemble learning model with BERT embeddings and domainspecific features to account for the unique characteristics of SO posts. By contrast, ASSORT_{IS} is designed to reuse pre-trained models while addressing the domain shift challenge when no training data is present (i.e., zero-shot learning). Both ASSORT_S and ASSORT_{IS} outperform six existing techniques by at least 13% and 7% respectively in terms of the F1 score. Furthermore, a human study shows that participants significantly preferred summaries generated by ASSORT_S and ASSORT_{IS} over the best baseline, while the preference difference between ASSORT_S and ASSORT_{IS} was small.

**Title:** CAILA: Concept-Aware Intra-Layer Adapters for Compositional Zero-Shot  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16681  
**Abstract:** Compositionality, the ability to combine existing concepts and generalize towards novel compositions, is a key functionality for intelligent entities. Here, we study the problem of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), which aims at recognizing novel attribute-object compositions. Recent approaches build their systems on top of large-scale Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, e.g. CLIP, and observe significant improvements. However, these methods treat CLIP as a black box and focus on pre- and post-CLIP operations. Here, we propose to dive deep into the architecture and insert adapters, a parameter-efficient technique proven to be effective among large language models, to each CLIP encoder layer. We further equip adapters with concept awareness so that concept-specific features of "object", "attribute" and "composition" can be extracted. We name our method CAILA, Concept-Aware Intra-Layer Adapters. Quantitative evaluations performed on three popular CZSL datasets, MIT-States, C-GQA, and UT-Zappos, reveal that CAILA achieves double-digit relative improvements against the current state-of-the-art on all benchmarks.

**Title:** Future-conditioned Unsupervised Pretraining for Decision Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16683  
**Abstract:** Recent research in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated that return-conditioned supervised learning is a powerful paradigm for decision-making problems. While promising, return conditioning is limited to training data labeled with rewards and therefore faces challenges in learning from unsupervised data. In this work, we aim to utilize generalized future conditioning to enable efficient unsupervised pretraining from reward-free and sub-optimal offline data. We propose Pretrained Decision Transformer (PDT), a conceptually simple approach for unsupervised RL pretraining. PDT leverages future trajectory information as a privileged context to predict actions during training. The ability to make decisions based on both present and future factors enhances PDT's capability for generalization. Besides, this feature can be easily incorporated into a return-conditioned framework for online finetuning, by assigning return values to possible futures and sampling future embeddings based on their respective values. Empirically, PDT outperforms or performs on par with its supervised pretraining counterpart, especially when dealing with sub-optimal data. Further analysis reveals that PDT can extract diverse behaviors from offline data and controllably sample high-return behaviors by online finetuning. Code is available at here.

**Title:** Detect Any Shadow: Segment Anything for Video Shadow Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16698  
**Abstract:** Segment anything model (SAM) has achieved great success in the field of natural image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM tends to classify shadows as background, resulting in poor segmentation performance for shadow detection task. In this paper, we propose an simple but effective approach for fine tuning SAM to detect shadows. Additionally, we also combine it with long short-term attention mechanism to extend its capabilities to video shadow detection. Specifically, we first fine tune SAM by utilizing shadow data combined with sparse prompts and apply the fine-tuned model to detect a specific frame (e.g., first frame) in the video with a little user assistance. Subsequently, using the detected frame as a reference, we employ a long short-term network to learn spatial correlations between distant frames and temporal consistency between contiguous frames, thereby achieving shadow information propagation across frames. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, with improvements of 17.2% and 3.3% in terms of MAE and IoU, respectively, validating the effectiveness of our method.

**Title:** AlignScore: Evaluating Factual Consistency with a Unified Alignment  Function  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16739  
**Abstract:** Many text generation applications require the generated text to be factually consistent with input information. Automatic evaluation of factual consistency is challenging. Previous work has developed various metrics that often depend on specific functions, such as natural language inference (NLI) or question answering (QA), trained on limited data. Those metrics thus can hardly assess diverse factual inconsistencies (e.g., contradictions, hallucinations) that occur in varying inputs/outputs (e.g., sentences, documents) from different tasks. In this paper, we propose AlignScore, a new holistic metric that applies to a variety of factual inconsistency scenarios as above. AlignScore is based on a general function of information alignment between two arbitrary text pieces. Crucially, we develop a unified training framework of the alignment function by integrating a large diversity of data sources, resulting in 4.7M training examples from 7 well-established tasks (NLI, QA, paraphrasing, fact verification, information retrieval, semantic similarity, and summarization). We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks including 22 evaluation datasets, where 19 of the datasets were never seen in the alignment training. AlignScore achieves substantial improvement over a wide range of previous metrics. Moreover, AlignScore (355M parameters) matches or even outperforms metrics based on ChatGPT and GPT-4 that are orders of magnitude larger.

**Title:** Diverse and Expressive Speech Prosody Prediction with Denoising  Diffusion Probabilistic Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16749  
**Abstract:** Expressive human speech generally abounds with rich and flexible speech prosody variations. The speech prosody predictors in existing expressive speech synthesis methods mostly produce deterministic predictions, which are learned by directly minimizing the norm of prosody prediction error. Its unimodal nature leads to a mismatch with ground truth distribution and harms the model's ability in making diverse predictions. Thus, we propose a novel prosody predictor based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model to take advantage of its high-quality generative modeling and training stability. Experiment results confirm that the proposed prosody predictor outperforms the deterministic baseline on both the expressiveness and diversity of prediction results with even fewer network parameters.

**Title:** StyleHumanCLIP: Text-guided Garment Manipulation for StyleGAN-Human  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16759  
**Abstract:** This paper tackles text-guided control of StyleGAN for editing garments in full-body human images. Existing StyleGAN-based methods suffer from handling the rich diversity of garments and body shapes and poses. We propose a framework for text-guided full-body human image synthesis via an attention-based latent code mapper, which enables more disentangled control of StyleGAN than existing mappers. Our latent code mapper adopts an attention mechanism that adaptively manipulates individual latent codes on different StyleGAN layers under text guidance. In addition, we introduce feature-space masking at inference time to avoid unwanted changes caused by text inputs. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal that our method can control generated images more faithfully to given texts than existing methods.

**Title:** Backpack Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16765  
**Abstract:** We present Backpacks: a new neural architecture that marries strong modeling performance with an interface for interpretability and control. Backpacks learn multiple non-contextual sense vectors for each word in a vocabulary, and represent a word in a sequence as a context-dependent, non-negative linear combination of sense vectors in this sequence. We find that, after training, sense vectors specialize, each encoding a different aspect of a word. We can interpret a sense vector by inspecting its (non-contextual, linear) projection onto the output space, and intervene on these interpretable hooks to change the model's behavior in predictable ways. We train a 170M-parameter Backpack language model on OpenWebText, matching the loss of a GPT-2 small (124Mparameter) Transformer. On lexical similarity evaluations, we find that Backpack sense vectors outperform even a 6B-parameter Transformer LM's word embeddings. Finally, we present simple algorithms that intervene on sense vectors to perform controllable text generation and debiasing. For example, we can edit the sense vocabulary to tend more towards a topic, or localize a source of gender bias to a sense vector and globally suppress that sense.

**Title:** Graph Neural Convection-Diffusion with Heterophily  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16780  
**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results across various graph learning tasks, but they often assume homophily, which can result in poor performance on heterophilic graphs. The connected nodes are likely to be from different classes or have dissimilar features on heterophilic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN that incorporates the principle of heterophily by modeling the flow of information on nodes using the convection-diffusion equation (CDE). This allows the CDE to take into account both the diffusion of information due to homophily and the ``convection'' of information due to heterophily. We conduct extensive experiments, which suggest that our framework can achieve competitive performance on node classification tasks for heterophilic graphs, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/zknus/Graph-Diffusion-CDE}.

**Title:** Incorporating Distributions of Discourse Structure for Long Document  Abstractive Summarization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16784  
**Abstract:** For text summarization, the role of discourse structure is pivotal in discerning the core content of a text. Regrettably, prior studies on incorporating Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) into transformer-based summarization models only consider the nuclearity annotation, thereby overlooking the variety of discourse relation types. This paper introduces the 'RSTformer', a novel summarization model that comprehensively incorporates both the types and uncertainty of rhetorical relations. Our RST-attention mechanism, rooted in document-level rhetorical structure, is an extension of the recently devised Longformer framework. Through rigorous evaluation, the model proposed herein exhibits significant superiority over state-of-the-art models, as evidenced by its notable performance on several automatic metrics and human evaluation.

**Title:** Calibration of Transformer-based Models for Identifying Stress and  Depression in Social Media  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16797  
**Abstract:** In today's fast-paced world, the rates of stress and depression present a surge. Social media provide assistance for the early detection of mental health conditions. Existing methods mainly introduce feature extraction approaches and train shallow machine learning classifiers. Other researches use deep neural networks or transformers. Despite the fact that transformer-based models achieve noticeable improvements, they cannot often capture rich factual knowledge. Although there have been proposed a number of studies aiming to enhance the pretrained transformer-based models with extra information or additional modalities, no prior work has exploited these modifications for detecting stress and depression through social media. In addition, although the reliability of a machine learning model's confidence in its predictions is critical for high-risk applications, there is no prior work taken into consideration the model calibration. To resolve the above issues, we present the first study in the task of depression and stress detection in social media, which injects extra linguistic information in transformer-based models, namely BERT and MentalBERT. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a Multimodal Adaptation Gate for creating the combined embeddings, which are given as input to a BERT (or MentalBERT) model. For taking into account the model calibration, we apply label smoothing. We test our proposed approaches in three publicly available datasets and demonstrate that the integration of linguistic features into transformer-based models presents a surge in the performance. Also, the usage of label smoothing contributes to both the improvement of the model's performance and the calibration of the model. We finally perform a linguistic analysis of the posts and show differences in language between stressful and non-stressful texts, as well as depressive and non-depressive posts.

**Title:** Do GPTs Produce Less Literal Translations?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16806  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have emerged as general-purpose language models capable of addressing many natural language generation or understanding tasks. On the task of Machine Translation (MT), multiple works have investigated few-shot prompting mechanisms to elicit better translations from LLMs. However, there has been relatively little investigation on how such translations differ qualitatively from the translations generated by standard Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. In this work, we investigate these differences in terms of the literalness of translations produced by the two systems. Using literalness measures involving word alignment and monotonicity, we find that translations out of English (E-X) from GPTs tend to be less literal, while exhibiting similar or better scores on MT quality metrics. We demonstrate that this finding is borne out in human evaluations as well. We then show that these differences are especially pronounced when translating sentences that contain idiomatic expressions.

**Title:** Negative-prompt Inversion: Fast Image Inversion for Editing with  Text-guided Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16807  
**Abstract:** In image editing employing diffusion models, it is crucial to preserve the reconstruction quality of the original image while changing its style. Although existing methods ensure reconstruction quality through optimization, a drawback of these is the significant amount of time required for optimization. In this paper, we propose negative-prompt inversion, a method capable of achieving equivalent reconstruction solely through forward propagation without optimization, thereby enabling much faster editing processes. We experimentally demonstrate that the reconstruction quality of our method is comparable to that of existing methods, allowing for inversion at a resolution of 512 pixels and with 50 sampling steps within approximately 5 seconds, which is more than 30 times faster than null-text inversion. Reduction of the computation time by the proposed method further allows us to use a larger number of sampling steps in diffusion models to improve the reconstruction quality with a moderate increase in computation time.

**Title:** Improved Visual Story Generation with Adaptive Context Modeling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16811  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models developed on top of powerful text-to-image generation models like Stable Diffusion achieve remarkable success in visual story generation. However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios. We conduct detailed model analysis and show that our model excels at generating semantically consistent images for stories.

**Title:** KNSE: A Knowledge-aware Natural Language Inference Framework for  Dialogue Symptom Status Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16833  
**Abstract:** Symptom diagnosis in medical conversations aims to correctly extract both symptom entities and their status from the doctor-patient dialogue. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called KNSE for symptom status recognition (SSR), where the SSR is formulated as a natural language inference (NLI) task. For each mentioned symptom in a dialogue window, we first generate knowledge about the symptom and hypothesis about status of the symptom, to form a (premise, knowledge, hypothesis) triplet. The BERT model is then used to encode the triplet, which is further processed by modules including utterance aggregation, self-attention, cross-attention, and GRU to predict the symptom status. Benefiting from the NLI formalization, the proposed framework can encode more informative prior knowledge to better localize and track symptom status, which can effectively improve the performance of symptom status recognition. Preliminary experiments on Chinese medical dialogue datasets show that KNSE outperforms previous competitive baselines and has advantages in cross-disease and cross-symptom scenarios.

**Title:** ChatGPT: A Study on its Utility for Ubiquitous Software Engineering  Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16837  
**Abstract:** ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models serve as the foundation for ChatGPT. ChatGPT is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques and has received widespread attention for its articulate responses across diverse domains of knowledge. In this study, we explore how ChatGPT can be used to help with common software engineering tasks. Many of the ubiquitous tasks covering the breadth of software engineering such as ambiguity resolution in software requirements, method name suggestion, test case prioritization, code review, log summarization can potentially be performed using ChatGPT. In this study, we explore fifteen common software engineering tasks using ChatGPT. We juxtapose and analyze ChatGPT's answers with the respective state of the art outputs (where available) and/or human expert ground truth. Our experiments suggest that for many tasks, ChatGPT does perform credibly and the response from it is detailed and often better than the human expert output or the state of the art output. However, for a few other tasks, ChatGPT in its present form provides incorrect answers and hence is not suited for such tasks.

**Title:** Playing repeated games with Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16867  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming society and permeating into diverse applications. As a result, LLMs will frequently interact with us and other agents. It is, therefore, of great societal value to understand how LLMs behave in interactive social settings. Here, we propose to use behavioral game theory to study LLM's cooperation and coordination behavior. To do so, we let different LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) play finitely repeated games with each other and with other, human-like strategies. Our results show that LLMs generally perform well in such tasks and also uncover persistent behavioral signatures. In a large set of two players-two strategies games, we find that LLMs are particularly good at games where valuing their own self-interest pays off, like the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma family. However, they behave sub-optimally in games that require coordination. We, therefore, further focus on two games from these distinct families. In the canonical iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we find that GPT-4 acts particularly unforgivingly, always defecting after another agent has defected only once. In the Battle of the Sexes, we find that GPT-4 cannot match the behavior of the simple convention to alternate between options. We verify that these behavioral signatures are stable across robustness checks. Finally, we show how GPT-4's behavior can be modified by providing further information about the other player as well as by asking it to predict the other player's actions before making a choice. These results enrich our understanding of LLM's social behavior and pave the way for a behavioral game theory for machines.

**Title:** MultiTool-CoT: GPT-3 Can Use Multiple External Tools with Chain of  Thought Prompting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16896  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on various reasoning tasks. To further improve the performance, we propose MultiTool-CoT, a novel framework that leverages chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to incorporate multiple external tools, such as a calculator and a knowledge retriever, during the reasoning process. We apply MultiTool-CoT to the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE, which requires both numerical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**Title:** Generalizing Adam To Manifolds For Efficiently Training Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16901  
**Abstract:** One of the primary reasons behind the success of neural networks has been the emergence of an array of new, highly-successful optimizers, perhaps most importantly the Adam optimizer. It is wiedely used for training neural networks, yet notoriously hard to interpret. Lacking a clear physical intuition, Adam is difficult to generalize to manifolds. Some attempts have been made to directly apply parts of the Adam algorithm to manifolds or to find an underlying structure, but a full generalization has remained elusive. In this work a new approach is presented that leverages the special structure of the manifolds which are relevant for optimization of neural networks, such as the Stiefel manifold, the symplectic Stiefel manifold, the Grassmann manifold and the symplectic Grassmann manifold: all of these are homogeneous spaces and as such admit a global tangent space representation. This global tangent space representation is used to perform all of the steps in the Adam optimizer. The resulting algorithm is then applied to train a transformer for which orthogonality constraints are enforced up to machine precision and we observe significant speed-ups in the training process. Optimization of neural networks where they weights do not lie on a manifold is identified as a special case of the presented framkework. This allows for a flexible implementation in which the learning rate is adapted simultaneously for all parameters, irrespective of whether they are an element of a general manifold or a vector space.

**Title:** PlaNeRF: SVD Unsupervised 3D Plane Regularization for NeRF Large-Scale  Scene Reconstruction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16914  
**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images and camera poses for Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Although NeRF can produce photorealistic results, it often suffers from overfitting to training views, leading to poor geometry reconstruction, especially in low-texture areas. This limitation restricts many important applications which require accurate geometry, such as extrapolated NVS, HD mapping and scene editing. To address this limitation, we propose a new method to improve NeRF's 3D structure using only RGB images and semantic maps. Our approach introduces a novel plane regularization based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), that does not rely on any geometric prior. In addition, we leverage the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) in our loss design to properly initialize the volumetric representation of NeRF. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms popular regularization approaches in accurate geometry reconstruction for large-scale outdoor scenes and achieves SoTA rendering quality on the KITTI-360 NVS benchmark.

**Title:** On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16934  
**Abstract:** Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved unprecedented performance in response generation, especially with visual inputs, enabling more creative and adaptable interaction than large language models such as ChatGPT. Nonetheless, multimodal generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable modality (e.g., vision). To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of open-source large VLMs in the most realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning the targeted responses. In particular, we first craft targeted adversarial examples against pretrained models such as CLIP and BLIP, and then transfer these adversarial examples to other VLMs such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, UniDiffuser, BLIP-2, and Img2Prompt. In addition, we observe that black-box queries on these VLMs can further improve the effectiveness of targeted evasion, resulting in a surprisingly high success rate for generating targeted responses. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding regarding the adversarial vulnerability of large VLMs and call for a more thorough examination of their potential security flaws before deployment in practice.

**Title:** CRoSS: Diffusion Model Makes Controllable, Robust and Secure Image  Steganography  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16936  
**Abstract:** Current image steganography techniques are mainly focused on cover-based methods, which commonly have the risk of leaking secret images and poor robustness against degraded container images. Inspired by recent developments in diffusion models, we discovered that two properties of diffusion models, the ability to achieve translation between two images without training, and robustness to noisy data, can be used to improve security and natural robustness in image steganography tasks. For the choice of diffusion model, we selected Stable Diffusion, a type of conditional diffusion model, and fully utilized the latest tools from open-source communities, such as LoRAs and ControlNets, to improve the controllability and diversity of container images. In summary, we propose a novel image steganography framework, named Controllable, Robust and Secure Image Steganography (CRoSS), which has significant advantages in controllability, robustness, and security compared to cover-based image steganography methods. These benefits are obtained without additional training. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce diffusion models to the field of image steganography. In the experimental section, we conducted detailed experiments to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed CRoSS framework in controllability, robustness, and security.

**Title:** Finspector: A Human-Centered Visual Inspection Tool for Exploring and  Comparing Biases among Foundation Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16937  
**Abstract:** Pre-trained transformer-based language models are becoming increasingly popular due to their exceptional performance on various benchmarks. However, concerns persist regarding the presence of hidden biases within these models, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes and reinforce harmful stereotypes. To address this issue, we propose Finspector, a human-centered visual inspection tool designed to detect biases in different categories through log-likelihood scores generated by language models. The goal of the tool is to enable researchers to easily identify potential biases using visual analytics, ultimately contributing to a fairer and more just deployment of these models in both academic and industrial settings.

**Title:** DiffusionNAG: Task-guided Neural Architecture Generation with Diffusion  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16943  
**Abstract:** Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful technique for automating neural architecture design. However, existing NAS methods either require an excessive amount of time for repetitive training or sampling of many task-irrelevant architectures. Moreover, they lack generalization across different tasks and usually require searching for optimal architectures for each task from scratch without reusing the knowledge from the previous NAS tasks. To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a novel transferable task-guided Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. With the guidance of a surrogate model, such as a performance predictor for a given task, our DiffusionNAG can generate task-optimal architectures for diverse tasks, including unseen tasks. DiffusionNAG is highly efficient as it generates task-optimal neural architectures by leveraging the prior knowledge obtained from the previous tasks and neural architecture distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a score network to ensure the generation of valid architectures represented as directed acyclic graphs, unlike existing graph generative models that focus on generating undirected graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffusionNAG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art transferable NAG model in architecture generation quality, as well as previous NAS methods on four computer vision datasets with largely reduced computational cost.

**Title:** Learning to Imagine: Visually-Augmented Natural Language Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16944  
**Abstract:** People often imagine relevant scenes to aid in the writing process. In this work, we aim to utilize visual information for composition in the same manner as humans. We propose a method, LIVE, that makes pre-trained language models (PLMs) Learn to Imagine for Visuallyaugmented natural language gEneration. First, we imagine the scene based on the text: we use a diffusion model to synthesize high-quality images conditioned on the input texts. Second, we use CLIP to determine whether the text can evoke the imagination in a posterior way. Finally, our imagination is dynamic, and we conduct synthesis for each sentence rather than generate only one image for an entire paragraph. Technically, we propose a novel plug-and-play fusion layer to obtain visually-augmented representations for each text. Our vision-text fusion layer is compatible with Transformerbased architecture. We have conducted extensive experiments on four generation tasks using BART and T5, and the automatic results and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We will release the code, model, and data at the link: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/LIVE.

**Title:** Accelerating Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems through Shortcut  Sampling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16965  
**Abstract:** Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to solve inverse problems in an unsupervised manner. Existing methods mainly focus on modifying the posterior sampling process while neglecting the potential of the forward process. In this work, we propose Shortcut Sampling for Diffusion (SSD), a novel pipeline for solving inverse problems. Instead of initiating from random noise, the key concept of SSD is to find the "Embryo", a transitional state that bridges the measurement image y and the restored image x. By utilizing the "shortcut" path of "input-Embryo-output", SSD can achieve precise and fast restoration. To obtain the Embryo in the forward process, We propose Distortion Adaptive Inversion (DA Inversion). Moreover, we apply back projection and attention injection as additional consistency constraints during the generation process. Experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SSD on several representative tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and colorization. Compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, our method achieves competitive results with only 30 NFEs. Moreover, SSD with 100 NFEs can outperform state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in certain tasks.

**Title:** TranSFormer: Slow-Fast Transformer for Machine Translation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16982  
**Abstract:** Learning multiscale Transformer models has been evidenced as a viable approach to augmenting machine translation systems. Prior research has primarily focused on treating subwords as basic units in developing such systems. However, the incorporation of fine-grained character-level features into multiscale Transformer has not yet been explored. In this work, we present a \textbf{S}low-\textbf{F}ast two-stream learning model, referred to as Tran\textbf{SF}ormer, which utilizes a ``slow'' branch to deal with subword sequences and a ``fast'' branch to deal with longer character sequences. This model is efficient since the fast branch is very lightweight by reducing the model width, and yet provides useful fine-grained features for the slow branch. Our TranSFormer shows consistent BLEU improvements (larger than 1 BLEU point) on several machine translation benchmarks.

**Title:** NavGPT: Explicit Reasoning in Vision-and-Language Navigation with Large  Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16986  
**Abstract:** Trained with an unprecedented scale of data, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit the emergence of significant reasoning abilities from model scaling. Such a trend underscored the potential of training LLMs with unlimited language data, advancing the development of a universal embodied agent. In this work, we introduce the NavGPT, a purely LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to reveal the reasoning capability of GPT models in complex embodied scenes by performing zero-shot sequential action prediction for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). At each step, NavGPT takes the textual descriptions of visual observations, navigation history, and future explorable directions as inputs to reason the agent's current status, and makes the decision to approach the target. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate NavGPT can explicitly perform high-level planning for navigation, including decomposing instruction into sub-goal, integrating commonsense knowledge relevant to navigation task resolution, identifying landmarks from observed scenes, tracking navigation progress, and adapting to exceptions with plan adjustment. Furthermore, we show that LLMs is capable of generating high-quality navigational instructions from observations and actions along a path, as well as drawing accurate top-down metric trajectory given the agent's navigation history. Despite the performance of using NavGPT to zero-shot R2R tasks still falling short of trained models, we suggest adapting multi-modality inputs for LLMs to use as visual navigation agents and applying the explicit reasoning of LLMs to benefit learning-based models.

**Title:** Three Towers: Flexible Contrastive Learning with Pretrained Image Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16999  
**Abstract:** We introduce Three Towers (3T), a flexible method to improve the contrastive learning of vision-language models by incorporating pretrained image classifiers. While contrastive models are usually trained from scratch, LiT (Zhai et al., 2022) has recently shown performance gains from using pretrained classifier embeddings. However, LiT directly replaces the image tower with the frozen embeddings, excluding any potential benefits of contrastively training the image tower. With 3T, we propose a more flexible strategy that allows the image tower to benefit from both pretrained embeddings and contrastive training. To achieve this, we introduce a third tower that contains the frozen pretrained embeddings, and we encourage alignment between this third tower and the main image-text towers. Empirically, 3T consistently improves over LiT and the CLIP-style from-scratch baseline for retrieval tasks. For classification, 3T reliably improves over the from-scratch baseline, and while it underperforms relative to LiT for JFT-pretrained models, it outperforms LiT for ImageNet-21k and Places365 pretraining.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17026  
**Abstract:** This article presents a theoretical evaluation of the computational universality of decoder-only transformer models. We extend the theoretical literature on transformer models and show that decoder-only transformer architectures (even with only a single layer and single attention head) are Turing complete under reasonable assumptions. From the theoretical analysis, we show sparsity/compressibility of the word embedding to be a necessary condition for Turing completeness to hold.

**Title:** A Mechanism for Sample-Efficient In-Context Learning for Sparse  Retrieval Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17040  
**Abstract:** We study the phenomenon of \textit{in-context learning} (ICL) exhibited by large language models, where they can adapt to a new learning task, given a handful of labeled examples, without any explicit parameter optimization. Our goal is to explain how a pre-trained transformer model is able to perform ICL under reasonable assumptions on the pre-training process and the downstream tasks. We posit a mechanism whereby a transformer can achieve the following: (a) receive an i.i.d. sequence of examples which have been converted into a prompt using potentially-ambiguous delimiters, (b) correctly segment the prompt into examples and labels, (c) infer from the data a \textit{sparse linear regressor} hypothesis, and finally (d) apply this hypothesis on the given test example and return a predicted label. We establish that this entire procedure is implementable using the transformer mechanism, and we give sample complexity guarantees for this learning framework. Our empirical findings validate the challenge of segmentation, and we show a correspondence between our posited mechanisms and observed attention maps for step (c).

**Title:** Learning and Leveraging Verifiers to Improve Planning Capabilities of  Pre-trained Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17077  
**Abstract:** There have been wide spread claims in the literature about the emergent reasoning capabilities of Pretrained Large Language Models. However, recent studies, have found that their ability to plan remains questionable. Through our experiments using GPT-2, we empirically demonstrate that the performance of a finetuned baseline remains poor because it violates pre-conditions of actions in the plans that it generates. To improve the planning capabilities of a finetuned LLM, we train a verifier, which can classify actions as being valid or invalid in a particular state. By randomly sampling actions from the same dataset, we generate examples of invalid actions which are then used to train a verifier which can check for action applicability. In the presence of diverse sampling from a generator and a verifier which can prune invalid trajectories, we show significant gains in the success rate on the Blocksworld domain. Additionally, we show that finetuning the GPT-2 generator itself to create the verifier generalizes better than finetuning the base GPT-2. Lastly, we investigate the role of the sampling temperature which can be used to control the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

**Title:** GRAtt-VIS: Gated Residual Attention for Auto Rectifying Video Instance  Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17096  
**Abstract:** Recent trends in Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) have seen a growing reliance on online methods to model complex and lengthy video sequences. However, the degradation of representation and noise accumulation of the online methods, especially during occlusion and abrupt changes, pose substantial challenges. Transformer-based query propagation provides promising directions at the cost of quadratic memory attention. However, they are susceptible to the degradation of instance features due to the above-mentioned challenges and suffer from cascading effects. The detection and rectification of such errors remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GRAtt-VIS}, \textbf{G}ated \textbf{R}esidual \textbf{Att}ention for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation. Firstly, we leverage a Gumbel-Softmax-based gate to detect possible errors in the current frame. Next, based on the gate activation, we rectify degraded features from its past representation. Such a residual configuration alleviates the need for dedicated memory and provides a continuous stream of relevant instance features. Secondly, we propose a novel inter-instance interaction using gate activation as a mask for self-attention. This masking strategy dynamically restricts the unrepresentative instance queries in the self-attention and preserves vital information for long-term tracking. We refer to this novel combination of Gated Residual Connection and Masked Self-Attention as \textbf{GRAtt} block, which can easily be integrated into the existing propagation-based framework. Further, GRAtt blocks significantly reduce the attention overhead and simplify dynamic temporal modeling. GRAtt-VIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on YouTube-VIS and the highly challenging OVIS dataset, significantly improving over previous methods.

**Title:** ControlVideo: Adding Conditional Control for One Shot Text-to-Video  Editing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17098  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present ControlVideo, a novel method for text-driven video editing. Leveraging the capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models and ControlNet, ControlVideo aims to enhance the fidelity and temporal consistency of videos that align with a given text while preserving the structure of the source video. This is achieved by incorporating additional conditions such as edge maps, fine-tuning the key-frame and temporal attention on the source video-text pair with carefully designed strategies. An in-depth exploration of ControlVideo's design is conducted to inform future research on one-shot tuning video diffusion models. Quantitatively, ControlVideo outperforms a range of competitive baselines in terms of faithfulness and consistency while still aligning with the textual prompt. Additionally, it delivers videos with high visual realism and fidelity w.r.t. the source content, demonstrating flexibility in utilizing controls containing varying degrees of source video information, and the potential for multiple control combinations.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17100  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a unified and generalist Biomedical Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiomedGPT) model, which leverages self-supervision on large and diverse datasets to accept multi-modal inputs and perform a range of downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that BiomedGPT delivers expansive and inclusive representations of biomedical data, outperforming the majority of preceding state-of-the-art models across five distinct tasks with 20 public datasets spanning over 15 unique biomedical modalities. Through the ablation study, we also showcase the efficacy of our multi-modal and multi-task pretraining approach in transferring knowledge to previously unseen data. Overall, our work presents a significant step forward in developing unified and generalist models for biomedicine, with far-reaching implications for improving healthcare outcomes.

**Title:** GeoVLN: Learning Geometry-Enhanced Visual Representation with Slot  Attention for Vision-and-Language Navigation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17102  
**Abstract:** Most existing works solving Room-to-Room VLN problem only utilize RGB images and do not consider local context around candidate views, which lack sufficient visual cues about surrounding environment. Moreover, natural language contains complex semantic information thus its correlations with visual inputs are hard to model merely with cross attention. In this paper, we propose GeoVLN, which learns Geometry-enhanced visual representation based on slot attention for robust Visual-and-Language Navigation. The RGB images are compensated with the corresponding depth maps and normal maps predicted by Omnidata as visual inputs. Technically, we introduce a two-stage module that combine local slot attention and CLIP model to produce geometry-enhanced representation from such input. We employ V&L BERT to learn a cross-modal representation that incorporate both language and vision informations. Additionally, a novel multiway attention module is designed, encouraging different phrases of input instruction to exploit the most related features from visual input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly designed modules and show the compelling performance of the proposed method.

**Title:** Large Language Models as Tool Makers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17126  
**Abstract:** Recent research shows the potential of enhancing the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) through the use of external tools. However, prior work along this line depends on the availability of existing tools. In this work, we take an initial step towards removing this dependency by proposing a closed-loop framework, referred to as LLMs As Tool Makers (LATM), where LLMs create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. Our approach consists of two key phases: 1) tool making: an LLM acts as the tool maker that crafts tools for given tasks, where a tool is implemented as a Python utility function. 2) tool using: an LLM acts as the tool user, which applies the tool built by the tool maker for problem-solving. The tool user can be either the same or a different LLM from the tool maker. Tool-making enables an LLM to continually generate tools that can be applied to different requests so that future requests can call the corresponding APIs when beneficial for solving the tasks. Furthermore, the division of labor among LLMs for tool-making and tool-using phases introduces the opportunity to achieve cost effectiveness without degrading the quality of generated tools and problem solutions. For example, recognizing that tool-making demands more sophisticated capabilities than tool-using, we can apply a powerful yet resource-intensive model as the tool maker, and a lightweight while cost-effective model as the tool user. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across a variety of complex reasoning tasks, including Big-Bench tasks. With GPT-4 as the tool maker and GPT-3.5 as the tool user, LATM can achieve performance that is on par with using GPT-4 for both tool making and tool using, while the inference cost is significantly reduced.

**Title:** Prompt Engineering for Transformer-based Chemical Similarity Search  Identifies Structurally Distinct Functional Analogues  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16330  
**Abstract:** Chemical similarity searches are widely used in-silico methods for identifying new drug-like molecules. These methods have historically relied on structure-based comparisons to compute molecular similarity. Here, we use a chemical language model to create a vector-based chemical search. We extend implementations by creating a prompt engineering strategy that utilizes two different chemical string representation algorithms: one for the query and the other for the database. We explore this method by reviewing the search results from five drug-like query molecules (penicillin G, nirmatrelvir, zidovudine, lysergic acid diethylamide, and fentanyl) and three dye-like query molecules (acid blue 25, avobenzone, and 2-diphenylaminocarbazole). We find that this novel method identifies molecules that are functionally similar to the query, indicated by the associated patent literature, and that many of these molecules are structurally distinct from the query, making them unlikely to be found with traditional chemical similarity search methods. This method may aid in the discovery of novel structural classes of molecules that achieve target functionality.

**Title:** Bi-fidelity Variational Auto-encoder for Uncertainty Quantification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16530  
**Abstract:** Quantifying the uncertainty of quantities of interest (QoIs) from physical systems is a primary objective in model validation. However, achieving this goal entails balancing the need for computational efficiency with the requirement for numerical accuracy. To address this trade-off, we propose a novel bi-fidelity formulation of variational auto-encoders (BF-VAE) designed to estimate the uncertainty associated with a QoI from low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) samples of the QoI. This model allows for the approximation of the statistics of the HF QoI by leveraging information derived from its LF counterpart. Specifically, we design a bi-fidelity auto-regressive model in the latent space that is integrated within the VAE's probabilistic encoder-decoder structure. An effective algorithm is proposed to maximize the variational lower bound of the HF log-likelihood in the presence of limited HF data, resulting in the synthesis of HF realizations with a reduced computational cost. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the bi-fidelity information bottleneck (BF-IB) to provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the proposed BF-VAE model. Our numerical results demonstrate that BF-VAE leads to considerably improved accuracy, as compared to a VAE trained using only HF data when limited HF data is available.

**Title:** A Score-Based Model for Learning Neural Wavefunctions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16540  
**Abstract:** Quantum Monte Carlo coupled with neural network wavefunctions has shown success in computing ground states of quantum many-body systems. Existing optimization approaches compute the energy by sampling local energy from an explicit probability distribution given by the wavefunction. In this work, we provide a new optimization framework for obtaining properties of quantum many-body ground states using score-based neural networks. Our new framework does not require explicit probability distribution and performs the sampling via Langevin dynamics. Our method is based on the key observation that the local energy is directly related to scores, defined as the gradient of the logarithmic wavefunction. Inspired by the score matching and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, we derive a weighted score matching objective to guide our score-based models to converge correctly to ground states. We first evaluate our approach with experiments on quantum harmonic traps, and results show that it can accurately learn ground states of atomic systems. By implicitly modeling high-dimensional data distributions, our work paves the way toward a more efficient representation of quantum systems.

**Title:** Tree-Based Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge with Applications to  Wasserstein Barycenters  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16557  
**Abstract:** Multi-marginal Optimal Transport (mOT), a generalization of OT, aims at minimizing the integral of a cost function with respect to a distribution with some prescribed marginals. In this paper, we consider an entropic version of mOT with a tree-structured quadratic cost, i.e., a function that can be written as a sum of pairwise cost functions between the nodes of a tree. To address this problem, we develop Tree-based Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (TreeDSB), an extension of the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) algorithm. TreeDSB corresponds to a dynamic and continuous state-space counterpart of the multimarginal Sinkhorn algorithm. A notable use case of our methodology is to compute Wasserstein barycenters which can be recast as the solution of a mOT problem on a star-shaped tree. We demonstrate that our methodology can be applied in high-dimensional settings such as image interpolation and Bayesian fusion.

**Title:** Error Bounds for Flow Matching Methods  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16860  
**Abstract:** Score-based generative models are a popular class of generative modelling techniques relying on stochastic differential equations (SDE). From their inception, it was realized that it was also possible to perform generation using ordinary differential equations (ODE) rather than SDE. This led to the introduction of the probability flow ODE approach and denoising diffusion implicit models. Flow matching methods have recently further extended these ODE-based approaches and approximate a flow between two arbitrary probability distributions. Previous work derived bounds on the approximation error of diffusion models under the stochastic sampling regime, given assumptions on the $L^2$ loss. We present error bounds for the flow matching procedure using fully deterministic sampling, assuming an $L^2$ bound on the approximation error and a certain regularity condition on the data distributions.

**Title:** Neural modeling of magnetic tape recorders  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16862  
**Abstract:** The sound of magnetic recording media, such as open-reel and cassette tape recorders, is still sought after by today's sound practitioners due to the imperfections embedded in the physics of the magnetic recording process. This paper proposes a method for digitally emulating this character using neural networks. The signal chain of the proposed system consists of three main components: the hysteretic nonlinearity and filtering jointly produced by the magnetic recording process as well as the record and playback amplifiers, the fluctuating delay originating from the tape transport, and the combined additive noise component from various electromagnetic origins. In our approach, the hysteretic nonlinear block is modeled using a recurrent neural network, while the delay trajectories and the noise component are generated using separate diffusion models, which employ U-net deep convolutional neural networks. According to the conducted objective evaluation, the proposed architecture faithfully captures the character of the magnetic tape recorder. The results of this study can be used to construct virtual replicas of vintage sound recording devices with applications in music production and audio antiquing tasks.
