**Title:** Diagnostic Spatio-temporal Transformer with Faithful Encoding  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17149  
**Abstract:** This paper addresses the task of anomaly diagnosis when the underlying data generation process has a complex spatio-temporal (ST) dependency. The key technical challenge is to extract actionable insights from the dependency tensor characterizing high-order interactions among temporal and spatial indices. We formalize the problem as supervised dependency discovery, where the ST dependency is learned as a side product of multivariate time-series classification. We show that temporal positional encoding used in existing ST transformer works has a serious limitation in capturing higher frequencies (short time scales). We propose a new positional encoding with a theoretical guarantee, based on discrete Fourier transform. We also propose a new ST dependency discovery framework, which can provide readily consumable diagnostic information in both spatial and temporal directions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed model, DFStrans (Diagnostic Fourier-based Spatio-temporal Transformer), in a real industrial application of building elevator control.

**Title:** Flow Matching for Scalable Simulation-Based Inference  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17161  
**Abstract:** Neural posterior estimation methods based on discrete normalizing flows have become established tools for simulation-based inference (SBI), but scaling them to high-dimensional problems can be challenging. Building on recent advances in generative modeling, we here present flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE), a technique for SBI using continuous normalizing flows. Like diffusion models, and in contrast to discrete flows, flow matching allows for unconstrained architectures, providing enhanced flexibility for complex data modalities. Flow matching, therefore, enables exact density evaluation, fast training, and seamless scalability to large architectures--making it ideal for SBI. We show that FMPE achieves competitive performance on an established SBI benchmark, and then demonstrate its improved scalability on a challenging scientific problem: for gravitational-wave inference, FMPE outperforms methods based on comparable discrete flows, reducing training time by 30% with substantially improved accuracy. Our work underscores the potential of FMPE to enhance performance in challenging inference scenarios, thereby paving the way for more advanced applications to scientific problems.

**Title:** From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns: Unveiling Coded Rhetoric with Language  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17174  
**Abstract:** Dogwhistles are coded expressions that simultaneously convey one meaning to a broad audience and a second one, often hateful or provocative, to a narrow in-group; they are deployed to evade both political repercussions and algorithmic content moderation. For example, in the sentence 'we need to end the cosmopolitan experiment,' the word 'cosmopolitan' likely means 'worldly' to many, but secretly means 'Jewish' to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians' speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3's performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detection, highlighting online risks of such coded language. This work sheds light on the theoretical and applied importance of dogwhistles in both NLP and computational social science, and provides resources for future research in modeling dogwhistles and mitigating their online harms.

**Title:** Hardware-Efficient Transformer Training via Piecewise Affine Operations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17190  
**Abstract:** Multiplications are responsible for most of the computational cost involved in neural network training and inference. Recent research has thus looked for ways to reduce the cost associated with them. Inspired by Mogami (2020), we replace multiplication with a cheap piecewise affine approximation that is achieved by adding the bit representation of the floating point numbers together as integers. We show that transformers can be trained with the resulting modified matrix multiplications on both vision and language tasks with little to no performance impact, and without changes to the training hyperparameters. We further replace all non-linearities in the networks making them fully and jointly piecewise affine in both inputs and weights. Finally, we show that we can eliminate all multiplications in the entire training process, including operations in the forward pass, backward pass and optimizer update, demonstrating the first successful training of modern neural network architectures in a fully multiplication-free fashion.

**Title:** Contrast, Attend and Diffuse to Decode High-Resolution Images from Brain  Activities  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17214  
**Abstract:** Decoding visual stimuli from neural responses recorded by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) presents an intriguing intersection between cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, promising advancements in understanding human visual perception and building non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. However, the task is challenging due to the noisy nature of fMRI signals and the intricate pattern of brain visual representations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a two-phase fMRI representation learning framework. The first phase pre-trains an fMRI feature learner with a proposed Double-contrastive Mask Auto-encoder to learn denoised representations. The second phase tunes the feature learner to attend to neural activation patterns most informative for visual reconstruction with guidance from an image auto-encoder. The optimized fMRI feature learner then conditions a latent diffusion model to reconstruct image stimuli from brain activities. Experimental results demonstrate our model's superiority in generating high-resolution and semantically accurate images, substantially exceeding previous state-of-the-art methods by 39.34% in the 50-way-top-1 semantic classification accuracy. Our research invites further exploration of the decoding task's potential and contributes to the development of non-invasive brain-machine interfaces.

**Title:** GVdoc: Graph-based Visual Document Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17219  
**Abstract:** The robustness of a model for real-world deployment is decided by how well it performs on unseen data and distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples. Visual document classifiers have shown impressive performance on in-distribution test sets. However, they tend to have a hard time correctly classifying and differentiating out-of-distribution examples. Image-based classifiers lack the text component, whereas multi-modality transformer-based models face the token serialization problem in visual documents due to their diverse layouts. They also require a lot of computing power during inference, making them impractical for many real-world applications. We propose, GVdoc, a graph-based document classification model that addresses both of these challenges. Our approach generates a document graph based on its layout, and then trains a graph neural network to learn node and graph embeddings. Through experiments, we show that our model, even with fewer parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art models on out-of-distribution data while retaining comparable performance on the in-distribution test set.

**Title:** Do We Really Need a Large Number of Visual Prompts?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17223  
**Abstract:** Due to increasing interest in adapting models on resource-constrained edges, parameter-efficient transfer learning has been widely explored. Among various methods, Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), prepending learnable prompts to input space, shows competitive fine-tuning performance compared to training of full network parameters. However, VPT increases the number of input tokens, resulting in additional computational overhead. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the number of prompts on fine-tuning performance and self-attention operation in a vision transformer architecture. Through theoretical and empirical analysis we show that adding more prompts does not lead to linear performance improvement. Further, we propose a Prompt Condensation (PC) technique that aims to prevent performance degradation from using a small number of prompts. We validate our methods on FGVC and VTAB-1k tasks and show that our approach reduces the number of prompts by ~70% while maintaining accuracy.

**Title:** COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of  Attention-Based Vision Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17235  
**Abstract:** Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\times$ reduction) than the existing works.

**Title:** Slide, Constrain, Parse, Repeat: Synchronous SlidingWindows for Document  AMR Parsing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17273  
**Abstract:** The sliding window approach provides an elegant way to handle contexts of sizes larger than the Transformer's input window, for tasks like language modeling. Here we extend this approach to the sequence-to-sequence task of document parsing. For this, we exploit recent progress in transition-based parsing to implement a parser with synchronous sliding windows over source and target. We develop an oracle and a parser for document-level AMR by expanding on Structured-BART such that it leverages source-target alignments and constrains decoding to guarantee synchronicity and consistency across overlapping windows. We evaluate our oracle and parser using the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing 3.0 corpus. On the Multi-Sentence development set of AMR 3.0, we show that our transition oracle loses only 8\% of the gold cross-sentential links despite using a sliding window. In practice, this approach also results in a high-quality document-level parser with manageable memory requirements. Our proposed system performs on par with the state-of-the-art pipeline approach for document-level AMR parsing task on Multi-Sentence AMR 3.0 corpus while maintaining sentence-level parsing performance.

**Title:** Improved Instruction Ordering in Recipe-Grounded Conversation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17280  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the task of instructional dialogue and focus on the cooking domain. Analyzing the generated output of the GPT-J model, we reveal that the primary challenge for a recipe-grounded dialog system is how to provide the instructions in the correct order. We hypothesize that this is due to the model's lack of understanding of user intent and inability to track the instruction state (i.e., which step was last instructed). Therefore, we propose to explore two auxiliary subtasks, namely User Intent Detection and Instruction State Tracking, to support Response Generation with improved instruction grounding. Experimenting with our newly collected dataset, ChattyChef, shows that incorporating user intent and instruction state information helps the response generation model mitigate the incorrect order issue. Furthermore, to investigate whether ChatGPT has completely solved this task, we analyze its outputs and find that it also makes mistakes (10.7% of the responses), about half of which are out-of-order instructions. We will release ChattyChef to facilitate further research in this area at: https://github.com/octaviaguo/ChattyChef.

**Title:** Exploiting Large Neuroimaging Datasets to Create Connectome-Constrained  Approaches for more Robust, Efficient, and Adaptable Artificial Intelligence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17300  
**Abstract:** Despite the progress in deep learning networks, efficient learning at the edge (enabling adaptable, low-complexity machine learning solutions) remains a critical need for defense and commercial applications. We envision a pipeline to utilize large neuroimaging datasets, including maps of the brain which capture neuron and synapse connectivity, to improve machine learning approaches. We have pursued different approaches within this pipeline structure. First, as a demonstration of data-driven discovery, the team has developed a technique for discovery of repeated subcircuits, or motifs. These were incorporated into a neural architecture search approach to evolve network architectures. Second, we have conducted analysis of the heading direction circuit in the fruit fly, which performs fusion of visual and angular velocity features, to explore augmenting existing computational models with new insight. Our team discovered a novel pattern of connectivity, implemented a new model, and demonstrated sensor fusion on a robotic platform. Third, the team analyzed circuitry for memory formation in the fruit fly connectome, enabling the design of a novel generative replay approach. Finally, the team has begun analysis of connectivity in mammalian cortex to explore potential improvements to transformer networks. These constraints increased network robustness on the most challenging examples in the CIFAR-10-C computer vision robustness benchmark task, while reducing learnable attention parameters by over an order of magnitude. Taken together, these results demonstrate multiple potential approaches to utilize insight from neural systems for developing robust and efficient machine learning techniques.

**Title:** Chain-of-Thought Hub: A Continuous Effort to Measure Large Language  Models' Reasoning Performance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17306  
**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are continuously being developed, their evaluation becomes increasingly important yet challenging. This work proposes Chain-of-Thought Hub, an open-source evaluation suite on the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models. We are interested in this setting for two reasons: (1) from the behavior of GPT and PaLM model family, we observe that complex reasoning is likely to be a key differentiator between weaker and stronger LLMs; (2) we envisage large language models to become the next-generation computational platform and foster an ecosystem of LLM-based new applications, this naturally requires the foundation models to perform complex tasks that often involve the composition of linguistic and logical operations. Our approach is to compile a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks to track the progress of LLMs. Our current results show that: (1) model scale clearly correlates with reasoning capabilities; (2) As of May 2023, Claude-v1.3 and PaLM-2 are the only two models that are comparable with GPT-4, while open-sourced models still lag behind; (3) LLaMA-65B performs closely to code-davinci-002, indicating that with successful further development such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), it has great potential to be close to GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results also suggest that for the open-source efforts to catch up, the community may focus more on building better base models and exploring RLHF.

**Title:** Super-Resolution of License Plate Images Using Attention Modules and  Sub-Pixel Convolution Layers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17313  
**Abstract:** Recent years have seen significant developments in the field of License Plate Recognition (LPR) through the integration of deep learning techniques and the increasing availability of training data. Nevertheless, reconstructing license plates (LPs) from low-resolution (LR) surveillance footage remains challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) approach that integrates attention and transformer modules to enhance the detection of structural and textural features in LR images. Our approach incorporates sub-pixel convolution layers (also known as PixelShuffle) and a loss function that uses an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for feature extraction. We trained the proposed architecture on synthetic images created by applying heavy Gaussian noise to high-resolution LP images from two public datasets, followed by bicubic downsampling. As a result, the generated images have a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of less than 0.10. Our results show that our approach for reconstructing these low-resolution synthesized images outperforms existing ones in both quantitative and qualitative measures.

**Title:** Radar Enlighten the Dark: Enhancing Low-Visibility Perception for  Automated Vehicles with Camera-Radar Fusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17318  
**Abstract:** Sensor fusion is a crucial augmentation technique for improving the accuracy and reliability of perception systems for automated vehicles under diverse driving conditions. However, adverse weather and low-light conditions remain challenging, where sensor performance degrades significantly, exposing vehicle safety to potential risks. Advanced sensors such as LiDARs can help mitigate the issue but with extremely high marginal costs. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based 3D object detection model "REDFormer" to tackle low visibility conditions, exploiting the power of a more practical and cost-effective solution by leveraging bird's-eye-view camera-radar fusion. Using the nuScenes dataset with multi-radar point clouds, weather information, and time-of-day data, our model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on classification and detection accuracy. Finally, we provide extensive ablation studies of each model component on their contributions to address the above-mentioned challenges. Particularly, it is shown in the experiments that our model achieves a significant performance improvement over the baseline model in low-visibility scenarios, specifically exhibiting a 31.31% increase in rainy scenes and a 46.99% enhancement in nighttime scenes.The source code of this study is publicly available.

**Title:** Zero-TPrune: Zero-Shot Token Pruning through Leveraging of the Attention  Graph in Pre-Trained Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17328  
**Abstract:** Deployment of Transformer models on the edge is increasingly challenging due to the exponentially growing model size and inference cost that scales quadratically with the number of tokens in the input sequence. Token pruning is an emerging solution to address this challenge due to its ease of deployment on various Transformer backbones. However, most token pruning methods require a computationally-expensive fine-tuning process after or during pruning, which is not desirable in many cases. Some recent works explore pruning of off-the-shelf pre-trained Transformers without fine-tuning. However, they only take the importance of tokens into consideration. In this work, we propose Zero-TPrune, the first zero-shot method that considers both the importance and similarity of tokens in performing token pruning. Zero-TPrune leverages the attention graph of pre-trained Transformer models to produce an importance rank for tokens and removes the less informative tokens. The attention matrix can be thought of as an adjacency matrix of a directed graph, to which a graph shift operator can be applied iteratively to obtain the importance score distribution. This distribution guides the partition of tokens into two groups and measures similarity between them. Due to the elimination of the fine-tuning overhead, Zero-TPrune can easily prune large models and perform hyperparameter tuning efficiently. We evaluate the performance of Zero-TPrune on vision tasks by applying it to various vision Transformer backbones. Compared with state-of-the-art pruning methods that require fine-tuning, Zero-TPrune not only eliminates the need for fine-tuning after pruning, but does so with only around 0.3% accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art fine-tuning-free pruning methods, Zero-TPrune reduces accuracy loss by up to 45% on medium-sized models.

**Title:** MADiff: Offline Multi-agent Learning with Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17330  
**Abstract:** Diffusion model (DM), as a powerful generative model, recently achieved huge success in various scenarios including offline reinforcement learning, where the policy learns to conduct planning by generating trajectory in the online evaluation. However, despite the effectiveness shown for single-agent learning, it remains unclear how DMs can operate in multi-agent problems, where agents can hardly complete teamwork without good coordination by independently modeling each agent's trajectories. In this paper, we propose MADiff, a novel generative multi-agent learning framework to tackle this problem. MADiff is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple diffusion agents. To the best of our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent offline RL framework, which behaves as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller, which includes opponent modeling and can be used for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MADiff takes advantage of the powerful generative ability of diffusion while well-suited in modeling complex multi-agent interactions. Our experiments show the superior performance of MADiff compared to baseline algorithms in a range of multi-agent learning tasks.

**Title:** Complementary and Integrative Health Lexicon (CIHLex) and Entity  Recognition in the Literature  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17353  
**Abstract:** Objective: Our study aimed to construct an exhaustive Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) Lexicon (CIHLex) to better represent the often underrepresented physical and psychological CIH approaches in standard terminologies. We also intended to apply advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and GPT-3.5 Turbo for CIH named entity recognition, evaluating their performance against established models like MetaMap and CLAMP. Materials and Methods: We constructed the CIHLex by integrating various resources, compiling and integrating data from biomedical literature and relevant knowledge bases. The Lexicon encompasses 198 unique concepts with 1090 corresponding unique terms. We matched these concepts to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Additionally, we developed and utilized BERT models and compared their efficiency in CIH named entity recognition to that of other models such as MetaMap, CLAMP, and GPT3.5-turbo. Results: From the 198 unique concepts in CIHLex, 62.1% could be matched to at least one term in the UMLS. Moreover, 75.7% of the mapped UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) were categorized as "Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure." Among the models applied to CIH named entity recognition, BLUEBERT delivered the highest macro average F1-score of 0.90, surpassing other models. Conclusion: Our CIHLex significantly augments representation of CIH approaches in biomedical literature. Demonstrating the utility of advanced NLP models, BERT notably excelled in CIH entity recognition. These results highlight promising strategies for enhancing standardization and recognition of CIH terminology in biomedical contexts.

**Title:** Bridging the Granularity Gap for Acoustic Modeling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17356  
**Abstract:** While Transformer has become the de-facto standard for speech, modeling upon the fine-grained frame-level features remains an open challenge of capturing long-distance dependencies and distributing the attention weights. We propose \textit{Progressive Down-Sampling} (PDS) which gradually compresses the acoustic features into coarser-grained units containing more complete semantic information, like text-level representation. In addition, we develop a representation fusion method to alleviate information loss that occurs inevitably during high compression. In this way, we compress the acoustic features into 1/32 of the initial length while achieving better or comparable performances on the speech recognition task. And as a bonus, it yields inference speedups ranging from 1.20$\times$ to 1.47$\times$. By reducing the modeling burden, we also achieve competitive results when training on the more challenging speech translation task.

**Title:** DNA-GPT: Divergent N-Gram Analysis for Training-Free Detection of  GPT-Generated Text  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17359  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have notably enhanced the fluency and diversity of machine-generated text. However, this progress also presents a significant challenge in detecting the origin of a given text, and current research on detection methods lags behind the rapid evolution of LLMs. Conventional training-based methods have limitations in flexibility, particularly when adapting to new domains, and they often lack explanatory power. To address this gap, we propose a novel training-free detection strategy called Divergent N-Gram Analysis (DNA-GPT). Given a text, we first truncate it in the middle and then use only the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the new remaining parts. By analyzing the differences between the original and new remaining parts through N-gram analysis in black-box or probability divergence in white-box, we can clearly illustrate significant discrepancies between machine-generated and human-written text. We conducted extensive experiments on the most advanced LLMs from OpenAI, including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4, as well as open-source models such as GPT-NeoX-20B and LLaMa-13B. Results show that our zero-shot approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing between human and GPT-generated text on four English and one German dataset, outperforming OpenAI's own classifier, which is trained on millions of text. Additionally, our methods provide reasonable explanations and evidence to support our claim, which is a unique feature of explainable detection. Our method is also robust under the revised text attack and can additionally solve model sourcing. Codes are available at https://github.com/Xianjun-Yang/DNA-GPT.

**Title:** A Zero-/Few-Shot Anomaly Classification and Segmentation Method for CVPR  2023 VAND Workshop Challenge Tracks 1&2: 1st Place on Zero-shot AD and 4th  Place on Few-shot AD  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17382  
**Abstract:** In this technical report, we briefly introduce our solution for the Zero/Few-shot Track of the Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 2023 Challenge. For industrial visual inspection, building a single model that can be rapidly adapted to numerous categories without or with only a few normal reference images is a promising research direction. This is primarily because of the vast variety of the product types. For the zero-shot track, we propose a solution based on the CLIP model by adding extra linear layers. These layers are used to map the image features to the joint embedding space, so that they can compare with the text features to generate the anomaly maps. Besides, when the reference images are available, we utilize multiple memory banks to store their features and compare them with the features of the test images during the testing phase. In this challenge, our method achieved first place in the zero-shot track, especially excelling in segmentation with an impressive F1 score improvement of 0.0489 over the second-ranked participant. Furthermore, in the few-shot track, we secured the fourth position overall, with our classification F1 score of 0.8687 ranking first among all participating teams.

**Title:** HyperFormer: Learning Expressive Sparse Feature Representations via  Hypergraph Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17386  
**Abstract:** Learning expressive representations for high-dimensional yet sparse features has been a longstanding problem in information retrieval. Though recent deep learning methods can partially solve the problem, they often fail to handle the numerous sparse features, particularly those tail feature values with infrequent occurrences in the training data. Worse still, existing methods cannot explicitly leverage the correlations among different instances to help further improve the representation learning on sparse features since such relational prior knowledge is not provided. To address these challenges, in this paper, we tackle the problem of representation learning on feature-sparse data from a graph learning perspective. Specifically, we propose to model the sparse features of different instances using hypergraphs where each node represents a data instance and each hyperedge denotes a distinct feature value. By passing messages on the constructed hypergraphs based on our Hypergraph Transformer (HyperFormer), the learned feature representations capture not only the correlations among different instances but also the correlations among features. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve feature representation learning on sparse features.

**Title:** SwiftSage: A Generative Agent with Fast and Slow Thinking for Complex  Interactive Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17390  
**Abstract:** We introduce SwiftSage, a novel agent framework inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, designed to excel in action planning for complex interactive reasoning tasks. SwiftSage integrates the strengths of behavior cloning and prompting large language models (LLMs) to enhance task completion performance. The framework comprises two primary modules: the Swift module, representing fast and intuitive thinking, and the Sage module, emulating deliberate thought processes. The Swift module is a small encoder-decoder LM fine-tuned on the oracle agent's action trajectories, while the Sage module employs LLMs such as GPT-4 for subgoal planning and grounding. We develop a heuristic method to harmoniously integrate the two modules, resulting in a more efficient and robust problem-solving process. In 30 tasks from the ScienceWorld benchmark, SwiftSage significantly outperforms other methods such as SayCan, ReAct, and Reflexion, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex real-world tasks.

**Title:** Parallel Corpus for Indigenous Language Translation: Spanish-Mazatec and  Spanish-Mixtec  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17404  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a parallel Spanish-Mazatec and Spanish-Mixtec corpus for machine translation (MT) tasks, where Mazatec and Mixtec are two indigenous Mexican languages. We evaluated the usability of the collected corpus using three different approaches: transformer, transfer learning, and fine-tuning pre-trained multilingual MT models. Fine-tuning the Facebook M2M100-48 model outperformed the other approaches, with BLEU scores of 12.09 and 22.25 for Mazatec-Spanish and Spanish-Mazatec translations, respectively, and 16.75 and 22.15 for Mixtec-Spanish and Spanish-Mixtec translations, respectively. The findings show that the dataset size (9,799 sentences in Mazatec and 13,235 sentences in Mixtec) affects translation performance and that indigenous languages work better when used as target languages. The findings emphasize the importance of creating parallel corpora for indigenous languages and fine-tuning models for low-resource translation tasks. Future research will investigate zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches to further improve translation performance in low-resource settings.

**Title:** CCDWT-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks Based on Color Channel Using  Discrete Wavelet Transform for Document Image Binarization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17420  
**Abstract:** To efficiently extract the textual information from color degraded document images is an important research topic. Long-term imperfect preservation of ancient documents has led to various types of degradation such as page staining, paper yellowing, and ink bleeding; these degradations badly impact the image processing for information extraction. In this paper, we present CCDWT-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) that utilizes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on RGB (red, green, blue) channel splited images. The proposed method comprises three stages: image preprocessing, image enhancement, and image binarization. This work conducts comparative experiments in the image preprocessing stage to determine the optimal selection of DWT with normalization. Additionally, we perform an ablation study on the results of the image enhancement stage and the image binarization stage to validate their positive effect on the model performance. This work compares the performance of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on DIBCO and H-DIBCO ((Handwritten) Document Image Binarization Competition) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that CCDWT-GAN achieves a top two performance on multiple benchmark datasets, and outperforms other SOTA methods.

**Title:** Understanding Emotion Valence is a Joint Deep Learning Task  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17422  
**Abstract:** The valence analysis of speakers' utterances or written posts helps to understand the activation and variations of the emotional state throughout the conversation. More recently, the concept of Emotion Carriers (EC) has been introduced to explain the emotion felt by the speaker and its manifestations. In this work, we investigate the natural inter-dependency of valence and ECs via a multi-task learning approach. We experiment with Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) for single-task, two-step, and joint settings for the valence and EC prediction tasks. We compare and evaluate the performance of generative (GPT-2) and discriminative (BERT) architectures in each setting. We observed that providing the ground truth label of one task improves the prediction performance of the models in the other task. We further observed that the discriminative model achieves the best trade-off of valence and EC prediction tasks in the joint prediction setting. As a result, we attain a single model that performs both tasks, thus, saving computation resources at training and inference times.

**Title:** FISEdit: Accelerating Text-to-image Editing via Cache-enabled Sparse  Diffusion Inference  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17423  
**Abstract:** Due to the recent success of diffusion models, text-to-image generation is becoming increasingly popular and achieves a wide range of applications. Among them, text-to-image editing, or continuous text-to-image generation, attracts lots of attention and can potentially improve the quality of generated images. It's common to see that users may want to slightly edit the generated image by making minor modifications to their input textual descriptions for several rounds of diffusion inference. However, such an image editing process suffers from the low inference efficiency of many existing diffusion models even using GPU accelerators. To solve this problem, we introduce Fast Image Semantically Edit (FISEdit), a cached-enabled sparse diffusion model inference engine for efficient text-to-image editing. The key intuition behind our approach is to utilize the semantic mapping between the minor modifications on the input text and the affected regions on the output image. For each text editing step, FISEdit can automatically identify the affected image regions and utilize the cached unchanged regions' feature map to accelerate the inference process. Extensive empirical results show that FISEdit can be $3.4\times$ and $4.4\times$ faster than existing methods on NVIDIA TITAN RTX and A100 GPUs respectively, and even generates more satisfactory images.

**Title:** Towards Consistent Video Editing with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17431  
**Abstract:** Existing works have advanced Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models for video editing in a one-shot learning manner. Despite their low requirements of data and computation, these methods might produce results of unsatisfied consistency with text prompt as well as temporal sequence, limiting their applications in the real world. In this paper, we propose to address the above issues with a novel EI$^2$ model towards \textbf{E}nhancing v\textbf{I}deo \textbf{E}diting cons\textbf{I}stency of TTI-based frameworks. Specifically, we analyze and find that the inconsistent problem is caused by newly added modules into TTI models for learning temporal information. These modules lead to covariate shift in the feature space, which harms the editing capability. Thus, we design EI$^2$ to tackle the above drawbacks with two classical modules: Shift-restricted Temporal Attention Module (STAM) and Fine-coarse Frame Attention Module (FFAM). First, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that covariate shift is highly related to Layer Normalization, thus STAM employs a \textit{Instance Centering} layer replacing it to preserve the distribution of temporal features. In addition, {STAM} employs an attention layer with normalized mapping to transform temporal features while constraining the variance shift. As the second part, we incorporate {STAM} with a novel {FFAM}, which efficiently leverages fine-coarse spatial information of overall frames to further enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EI$^2$ model for text-driven video editing.

**Title:** GMSF: Global Matching Scene Flow  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17432  
**Abstract:** We tackle the task of scene flow estimation from point clouds. Given a source and a target point cloud, the objective is to estimate a translation from each point in the source point cloud to the target, resulting in a 3D motion vector field. Previous dominant scene flow estimation methods require complicated coarse-to-fine or recurrent architectures as a multi-stage refinement. In contrast, we propose a significantly simpler single-scale one-shot global matching to address the problem. Our key finding is that reliable feature similarity between point pairs is essential and sufficient to estimate accurate scene flow. To this end, we propose to decompose the feature extraction step via a hybrid local-global-cross transformer architecture which is crucial to accurate and robust feature representations. Extensive experiments show that GMSF sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple scene flow estimation benchmarks. On FlyingThings3D, with the presence of occlusion points, GMSF reduces the outlier percentage from the previous best performance of 27.4% to 11.7%. On KITTI Scene Flow, without any fine-tuning, our proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance.

**Title:** Modeling Adversarial Attack on Pre-trained Language Models as Sequential  Decision Making  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17440  
**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been widely used to underpin various downstream tasks. However, the adversarial attack task has found that PLMs are vulnerable to small perturbations. Mainstream methods adopt a detached two-stage framework to attack without considering the subsequent influence of substitution at each step. In this paper, we formally model the adversarial attack task on PLMs as a sequential decision-making problem, where the whole attack process is sequential with two decision-making problems, i.e., word finder and word substitution. Considering the attack process can only receive the final state without any direct intermediate signals, we propose to use reinforcement learning to find an appropriate sequential attack path to generate adversaries, named SDM-Attack. Extensive experimental results show that SDM-Attack achieves the highest attack success rate with a comparable modification rate and semantic similarity to attack fine-tuned BERT. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate the generalization and transferability of SDM-Attack. The code is available at https://github.com/fduxuan/SDM-Attack.

**Title:** Analysis over vision-based models for pedestrian action anticipation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17451  
**Abstract:** Anticipating human actions in front of autonomous vehicles is a challenging task. Several papers have recently proposed model architectures to address this problem by combining multiple input features to predict pedestrian crossing actions. This paper focuses specifically on using images of the pedestrian's context as an input feature. We present several spatio-temporal model architectures that utilize standard CNN and Transformer modules to serve as a backbone for pedestrian anticipation. However, the objective of this paper is not to surpass state-of-the-art benchmarks but rather to analyze the positive and negative predictions of these models. Therefore, we provide insights on the explainability of vision-based Transformer models in the context of pedestrian action prediction. We will highlight cases where the model can achieve correct quantitative results but falls short in providing human-like explanations qualitatively, emphasizing the importance of investing in explainability for pedestrian action anticipation problems.

**Title:** CrossGET: Cross-Guided Ensemble of Tokens for Accelerating  Vision-Language Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17455  
**Abstract:** Vision-language models have achieved tremendous progress far beyond what we ever expected. However, their computational costs and latency are also dramatically growing with rapid development, making model acceleration exceedingly critical for researchers with limited resources and consumers with low-end devices. Although extensively studied for unimodal models, the acceleration for multimodal models, especially the vision-language Transformers, is still relatively under-explored. Accordingly, this paper proposes \textbf{Cross}-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}nsemble of \textbf{T}okens (\textbf{\emph{CrossGET}}) as a universal vison-language Transformer acceleration framework, which adaptively reduces token numbers during inference via cross-modal guidance on-the-fly, leading to significant model acceleration while keeping high performance. Specifically, the proposed \textit{CrossGET} has two key designs:1) \textit{Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble}. \textit{CrossGET} incorporates cross-modal guided token matching and ensemble to merge tokens effectively, only introducing cross-modal tokens with negligible extra parameters. 2) \textit{Complete-Graph Soft Matching}. In contrast to the previous bipartite soft matching approach, \textit{CrossGET} introduces an efficient and effective complete-graph soft matching policy to achieve more reliable token-matching results. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks, datasets, and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed \textit{CrossGET} framework. The code will be at https://github.com/sdc17/CrossGET.

**Title:** A Diffusion Model for Event Skeleton Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17458  
**Abstract:** Event skeleton generation, aiming to induce an event schema skeleton graph with abstracted event nodes and their temporal relations from a set of event instance graphs, is a critical step in the temporal complex event schema induction task. Existing methods effectively address this task from a graph generation perspective but suffer from noise-sensitive and error accumulation, e.g., the inability to correct errors while generating schema. We, therefore, propose a novel Diffusion Event Graph Model~(DEGM) to address these issues. Our DEGM is the first workable diffusion model for event skeleton generation, where the embedding and rounding techniques with a custom edge-based loss are introduced to transform a discrete event graph into learnable latent representation. Furthermore, we propose a denoising training process to maintain the model's robustness. Consequently, DEGM derives the final schema, where error correction is guaranteed by iteratively refining the latent representation during the schema generation process. Experimental results on three IED bombing datasets demonstrate that our DEGM achieves better results than other state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhufq00/EventSkeletonGeneration.

**Title:** Text-to-image Editing by Image Information Removal  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17489  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in text-guided image generation. To leverage the knowledge of text-guided image generation models in image editing, current approaches either fine-tune the pretrained models using the input image (e.g., Imagic) or incorporate structure information as additional constraints into the pretrained models (e.g., ControlNet). However, fine-tuning large-scale diffusion models on a single image can lead to severe overfitting issues and lengthy inference time. The information leakage from pretrained models makes it challenging to preserve the text-irrelevant content of the input image while generating new features guided by language descriptions. On the other hand, methods that incorporate structural guidance (e.g., edge maps, semantic maps, keypoints) as additional constraints face limitations in preserving other attributes of the original image, such as colors or textures. A straightforward way to incorporate the original image is to directly use it as an additional control. However, since image editing methods are typically trained on the image reconstruction task, the incorporation can lead to the identical mapping issue, where the model learns to output an image identical to the input, resulting in limited editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a text-to-image editing model with Image Information Removal module (IIR) to selectively erase color-related and texture-related information from the original image, allowing us to better preserve the text-irrelevant content and avoid the identical mapping issue. We evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets: CUB, Outdoor Scenes, and COCO. Our approach achieves the best editability-fidelity trade-off, and our edited images are approximately 35% more preferred by annotators than the prior-arts on COCO.

**Title:** Model Dementia: Generated Data Makes Models Forget  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493  
**Abstract:** Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We call this effect model dementia and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.

**Title:** Scalable Transformer for PDE Surrogate Modeling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17560  
**Abstract:** Transformer has shown state-of-the-art performance on various applications and has recently emerged as a promising tool for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite the introduction of linear-complexity variant, applying attention to a large number of grid points can result in instability and is still expensive to compute. In this work, we propose Factorized Transformer(FactFormer), which is based on an axial factorized kernel integral. Concretely, we introduce a learnable projection operator that decomposes the input function into multiple sub-functions with one-dimensional domain. These sub-functions are then evaluated and used to compute the instance-based kernel with an axial factorized scheme. We showcase that the proposed model is able to simulate 2D Kolmogorov flow on a 256 by 256 grid and 3D smoke buoyancy on a 64 by 64 by 64 grid with good accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we find out that with the factorization scheme, the attention matrices enjoy a more compact spectrum than full softmax-free attention matrices.

**Title:** An Investigation into the Effects of Pre-training Data Distributions for  Pathology Report Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17588  
**Abstract:** Pre-trained transformer models have demonstrated success across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In applying these models to the clinical domain, a prevailing assumption is that pre-training language models from scratch on large-scale biomedical data results in substantial improvements. We test this assumption with 4 pathology classification tasks on a corpus of 2907 prostate cancer pathology reports. We evaluate 5 transformer pre-trained models that are the same size but differ in pre-training corpora. Specifically, we analyze 3 categories of models: 1)General-domain: BERT and Turing Natural Language Representation (TNLR) models, which use general corpora for pre-training, 2)Mixed-domain: BioBERT which is obtained from BERT by including PubMed abstracts in pre-training and Clinical BioBERT which additionally includes MIMIC-III clinical notes and 3)Domain-specific: PubMedBERT which is pre-trained from scratch on PubMed abstracts. We find the mixed-domain and domain-specific models exhibit faster feature disambiguation during fine-tuning. However, the domain-specific model, PubMedBERT, can overfit to minority classes when presented with class imbalance, a common scenario in pathology report data. At the same time, the mixed-domain models are more resistant to overfitting. Our findings indicate that the use of general natural language and domain-specific corpora in pre-training serve complementary purposes for pathology report classification. The first enables resistance to overfitting when fine-tuning on an imbalanced dataset while the second allows for more accurate modelling of the fine-tuning domain. An expert evaluation is also conducted to reveal common outlier modes of each model. Our results could inform better fine-tuning practices in the clinical domain, to possibly leverage the benefits of mixed-domain models for imbalanced downstream datasets.

**Title:** Graph Inductive Biases in Transformers without Message Passing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17589  
**Abstract:** Transformers for graph data are increasingly widely studied and successful in numerous learning tasks. Graph inductive biases are crucial for Graph Transformers, and previous works incorporate them using message-passing modules and/or positional encodings. However, Graph Transformers that use message-passing inherit known issues of message-passing, and differ significantly from Transformers used in other domains, thus making transfer of research advances more difficult. On the other hand, Graph Transformers without message-passing often perform poorly on smaller datasets, where inductive biases are more crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose the Graph Inductive bias Transformer (GRIT) -- a new Graph Transformer that incorporates graph inductive biases without using message passing. GRIT is based on several architectural changes that are each theoretically and empirically justified, including: learned relative positional encodings initialized with random walk probabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair representations, and injection of degree information in each layer. We prove that GRIT is expressive -- it can express shortest path distances and various graph propagation matrices. GRIT achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance across a variety of graph datasets, thus showing the power that Graph Transformers without message-passing can deliver.

**Title:** Reward Collapse in Aligning Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17608  
**Abstract:** The extraordinary capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 are in part unleashed by aligning them with reward models that are trained on human preferences, which are often represented as rankings of responses to prompts. In this paper, we document the phenomenon of \textit{reward collapse}, an empirical observation where the prevailing ranking-based approach results in an \textit{identical} reward distribution \textit{regardless} of the prompts during the terminal phase of training. This outcome is undesirable as open-ended prompts like ``write a short story about your best friend'' should yield a continuous range of rewards for their completions, while specific prompts like ``what is the capital of New Zealand'' should generate either high or low rewards. Our theoretical investigation reveals that reward collapse is primarily due to the insufficiency of the ranking-based objective function to incorporate prompt-related information during optimization. This insight allows us to derive closed-form expressions for the reward distribution associated with a set of utility functions in an asymptotic regime. To overcome reward collapse, we introduce a prompt-aware optimization scheme that provably admits a prompt-dependent reward distribution within the interpolating regime. Our experimental results suggest that our proposed prompt-aware utility functions significantly alleviate reward collapse during the training of reward models.

**Title:** EvIcon: Designing High-Usability Icon with Human-in-the-loop Exploration  and IconCLIP  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17609  
**Abstract:** Interface icons are prevalent in various digital applications. Due to limited time and budgets, many designers rely on informal evaluation, which often results in poor usability icons. In this paper, we propose a unique human-in-the-loop framework that allows our target users, i.e., novice and professional UI designers, to improve the usability of interface icons efficiently. We formulate several usability criteria into a perceptual usability function and enable users to iteratively revise an icon set with an interactive design tool, EvIcon. We take a large-scale pre-trained joint image-text embedding (CLIP) and fine-tune it to embed icon visuals with icon tags in the same embedding space (IconCLIP). During the revision process, our design tool provides two types of instant perceptual usability feedback. First, we provide perceptual usability feedback modeled by deep learning models trained on IconCLIP embeddings and crowdsourced perceptual ratings. Second, we use the embedding space of IconCLIP to assist users in improving icons' visual distinguishability among icons within the user-prepared icon set. To provide the perceptual prediction, we compiled IconCEPT10K, the first large-scale dataset of perceptual usability ratings over $10,000$ interface icons, by conducting a crowdsourcing study. We demonstrated that our framework could benefit UI designers' interface icon revision process with a wide range of professional experience. Moreover, the interface icons designed using our framework achieved better semantic distance and familiarity, verified by an additional online user study.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17611  
**Abstract:** This report describes our approach for the EGO4D 2023 Visual Query 2D Localization Challenge. Our method aims to reduce the number of False Positives (FP) that occur because of high similarity between the visual crop and the proposed bounding boxes from the baseline's Region Proposal Network (RPN). Our method uses a transformer to determine similarity in higher dimensions which is used as our prior belief. The results are then combined together with the similarity in lower dimensions from the Siamese Head, acting as our measurement, to generate a posterior which is then used to determine the final similarity of the visual crop with the proposed bounding box. Our code is publicly available $\href{https://github.com/s-m-asjad/EGO4D_VQ2D}{here}$.

**Title:** AI Coach Assist: An Automated Approach for Call Recommendation in  Contact Centers for Agent Coaching  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17619  
**Abstract:** In recent years, the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the contact center industry is on the rise. One area where AI can have a significant impact is in the coaching of contact center agents. By analyzing call transcripts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it would be possible to quickly determine which calls are most relevant for coaching purposes. In this paper, we present AI Coach Assist, which leverages the pre-trained transformer-based language models to determine whether a given call is coachable or not based on the quality assurance (QA) questions asked by the contact center managers or supervisors. The system was trained and evaluated on a large dataset collected from real-world contact centers and provides an effective way to recommend calls to the contact center managers that are more likely to contain coachable moments. Our experimental findings demonstrate the potential of AI Coach Assist to improve the coaching process, resulting in enhancing the performance of contact center agents.

**Title:** SimpSON: Simplifying Photo Cleanup with Single-Click Distracting Object  Segmentation Network  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17624  
**Abstract:** In photo editing, it is common practice to remove visual distractions to improve the overall image quality and highlight the primary subject. However, manually selecting and removing these small and dense distracting regions can be a laborious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose an interactive distractor selection method that is optimized to achieve the task with just a single click. Our method surpasses the precision and recall achieved by the traditional method of running panoptic segmentation and then selecting the segments containing the clicks. We also showcase how a transformer-based module can be used to identify more distracting regions similar to the user's click position. Our experiments demonstrate that the model can effectively and accurately segment unknown distracting objects interactively and in groups. By significantly simplifying the photo cleaning and retouching process, our proposed model provides inspiration for exploring rare object segmentation and group selection with a single click.

**Title:** Robust Natural Language Understanding with Residual Attention Debiasing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17627  
**Abstract:** Natural language understanding (NLU) models often suffer from unintended dataset biases. Among bias mitigation methods, ensemble-based debiasing methods, especially product-of-experts (PoE), have stood out for their impressive empirical success. However, previous ensemble-based debiasing methods typically apply debiasing on top-level logits without directly addressing biased attention patterns. Attention serves as the main media of feature interaction and aggregation in PLMs and plays a crucial role in providing robust prediction. In this paper, we propose REsidual Attention Debiasing (READ), an end-to-end debiasing method that mitigates unintended biases from attention. Experiments on three NLU tasks show that READ significantly improves the performance of BERT-based models on OOD data with shortcuts removed, including +12.9% accuracy on HANS, +11.0% accuracy on FEVER-Symmetric, and +2.7% F1 on PAWS. Detailed analyses demonstrate the crucial role of unbiased attention in robust NLU models and that READ effectively mitigates biases in attention.

**Title:** DPFormer: Learning Differentially Private Transformer on Long-Tailed  Data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17633  
**Abstract:** The Transformer has emerged as a versatile and effective architecture with broad applications. However, it still remains an open problem how to efficiently train a Transformer model of high utility with differential privacy guarantees. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in learning differentially private Transformers, i.e., heavy computation overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping and unintentional attention distraction within the attention mechanism. In response, we propose DPFormer, equipped with Phantom Clipping and Re-Attention Mechanism, to address these challenges. Our theoretical analysis shows that DPFormer can reduce computational costs during gradient clipping and effectively mitigate attention distraction (which could obstruct the training process and lead to a significant performance drop, especially in the presence of long-tailed data). Such analysis is further corroborated by empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DPFormer.

**Title:** ConaCLIP: Exploring Distillation of Fully-Connected Knowledge  Interaction Graph for Lightweight Text-Image Retrieval  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17652  
**Abstract:** Large-scale pre-trained text-image models with dual-encoder architectures (such as CLIP) are typically adopted for various vision-language applications, including text-image retrieval. However,these models are still less practical on edge devices or for real-time situations, due to the substantial indexing and inference time and the large consumption of computational resources. Although knowledge distillation techniques have been widely utilized for uni-modal model compression, how to expand them to the situation when the numbers of modalities and teachers/students are doubled has been rarely studied. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments on this topic and propose the fully-Connected knowledge interaction graph (Cona) technique for cross-modal pre-training distillation. Based on our findings, the resulting ConaCLIP achieves SOTA performances on the widely-used Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks under the lightweight setting. An industry application of our method on an e-commercial platform further demonstrates the significant effectiveness of ConaCLIP.

**Abstract:** The paper describes the RuSentNE-2023 evaluation devoted to targeted sentiment analysis in Russian news texts. The task is to predict sentiment towards a named entity in a single sentence. The dataset for RuSentNE-2023 evaluation is based on the Russian news corpus RuSentNE having rich sentiment-related annotation. The corpus is annotated with named entities and sentiments towards these entities, along with related effects and emotional states. The evaluation was organized using the CodaLab competition framework. The main evaluation measure was macro-averaged measure of positive and negative classes. The best results achieved were of 66% Macro F-measure (Positive+Negative classes). We also tested ChatGPT on the test set from our evaluation and found that the zero-shot answers provided by ChatGPT reached 60% of the F-measure, which corresponds to 4th place in the evaluation. ChatGPT also provided detailed explanations of its conclusion. This can be considered as quite high for zero-shot application.

**Title:** Evaluating GPT-3 Generated Explanations for Hateful Content Moderation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17680  
**Abstract:** Recent research has focused on using large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for hate speech through fine-tuning or prompting. Despite the growing interest in this area, these generated explanations' effectiveness and potential limitations remain poorly understood. A key concern is that these explanations, generated by LLMs, may lead to erroneous judgments about the nature of flagged content by both users and content moderators. For instance, an LLM-generated explanation might inaccurately convince a content moderator that a benign piece of content is hateful. In light of this, we propose an analytical framework for examining hate speech explanations and conducted an extensive survey on evaluating such explanations. Specifically, we prompted GPT-3 to generate explanations for both hateful and non-hateful content, and a survey was conducted with 2,400 unique respondents to evaluate the generated explanations. Our findings reveal that (1) human evaluators rated the GPT-generated explanations as high quality in terms of linguistic fluency, informativeness, persuasiveness, and logical soundness, (2) the persuasive nature of these explanations, however, varied depending on the prompting strategy employed, and (3) this persuasiveness may result in incorrect judgments about the hatefulness of the content. Our study underscores the need for caution in applying LLM-generated explanations for content moderation. Code and results are available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/GPT3-HateEval.

**Title:** SQuARe: A Large-Scale Dataset of Sensitive Questions and Acceptable  Responses Created Through Human-Machine Collaboration  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17696  
**Abstract:** The potential social harms that large language models pose, such as generating offensive content and reinforcing biases, are steeply rising. Existing works focus on coping with this concern while interacting with ill-intentioned users, such as those who explicitly make hate speech or elicit harmful responses. However, discussions on sensitive issues can become toxic even if the users are well-intentioned. For safer models in such scenarios, we present the Sensitive Questions and Acceptable Response (SQuARe) dataset, a large-scale Korean dataset of 49k sensitive questions with 42k acceptable and 46k non-acceptable responses. The dataset was constructed leveraging HyperCLOVA in a human-in-the-loop manner based on real news headlines. Experiments show that acceptable response generation significantly improves for HyperCLOVA and GPT-3, demonstrating the efficacy of this dataset.

**Title:** KoSBI: A Dataset for Mitigating Social Bias Risks Towards Safer Large  Language Model Application  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17701  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) learn not only natural text generation abilities but also social biases against different demographic groups from real-world data. This poses a critical risk when deploying LLM-based applications. Existing research and resources are not readily applicable in South Korea due to the differences in language and culture, both of which significantly affect the biases and targeted demographic groups. This limitation requires localized social bias datasets to ensure the safe and effective deployment of LLMs. To this end, we present KO SB I, a new social bias dataset of 34k pairs of contexts and sentences in Korean covering 72 demographic groups in 15 categories. We find that through filtering-based moderation, social biases in generated content can be reduced by 16.47%p on average for HyperCLOVA (30B and 82B), and GPT-3.

**Title:** Rethinking Masked Language Modeling for Chinese Spelling Correction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17721  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we study Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) as a joint decision made by two separate models: a language model and an error model. Through empirical analysis, we find that fine-tuning BERT tends to over-fit the error model while under-fit the language model, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution error patterns. Given that BERT is the backbone of most CSC models, this phenomenon has a significant negative impact. To address this issue, we are releasing a multi-domain benchmark LEMON, with higher quality and diversity than existing benchmarks, to allow a comprehensive assessment of the open domain generalization of CSC models. Then, we demonstrate that a very simple strategy, randomly masking 20\% non-error tokens from the input sequence during fine-tuning is sufficient for learning a much better language model without sacrificing the error model. This technique can be applied to any model architecture and achieves new state-of-the-art results on SIGHAN, ECSpell, and LEMON.

**Title:** Breaking Language Barriers with a LEAP: Learning Strategies for Polyglot  LLMs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17740  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of transforming numerous domains globally. However, their inclusivity and effectiveness remain limited for non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper tackles the imperative challenge of enhancing the multilingual performance of LLMs, specifically focusing on Generative models. Through systematic investigation and evaluation of diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets, we present novel techniques that unlock the true potential of LLMs in a polyglot landscape. Our approach encompasses three key strategies that yield remarkable improvements in multilingual proficiency. First, by meticulously optimizing prompts tailored for polyglot LLMs, we unlock their latent capabilities, resulting in substantial performance boosts across languages. Second, we introduce a new hybrid approach that synergizes GPT generation with multilingual embeddings and achieves significant multilingual performance improvement on critical tasks like QA and retrieval. Finally, to further propel the performance of polyglot LLMs, we introduce a novel learning algorithm that dynamically selects the optimal prompt strategy, LLM model, and embeddings per query. This dynamic adaptation maximizes the efficacy of LLMs across languages, outperforming best static and random strategies. Our results show substantial advancements in multilingual understanding and generation across a diverse range of languages.

**Title:** Whitening-based Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17746  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a whitening-based contrastive learning method for sentence embedding learning (WhitenedCSE), which combines contrastive learning with a novel shuffled group whitening. Generally, contrastive learning pulls distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in the feature space. A popular alternative to the "pushing'' operation is whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity. Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t. the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity. We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group. By shuffling the group division, we derive multiple distortions of a single sample and thus increase the positive sample diversity. Consequently, using multiple positive samples with enhanced diversity further improves contrastive learning due to better alignment. Extensive experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks show our method achieves consistent improvement over the contrastive learning baseline and sets new states of the art, e.g., 78.78\% (+2.53\% based on BERT\ba) Spearman correlation on STS tasks.

**Title:** Generating EDU Extracts for Plan-Guided Summary Re-Ranking  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17779  
**Abstract:** Two-step approaches, in which summary candidates are generated-then-reranked to return a single summary, can improve ROUGE scores over the standard single-step approach. Yet, standard decoding methods (i.e., beam search, nucleus sampling, and diverse beam search) produce candidates with redundant, and often low quality, content. In this paper, we design a novel method to generate candidates for re-ranking that addresses these issues. We ground each candidate abstract on its own unique content plan and generate distinct plan-guided abstracts using a model's top beam. More concretely, a standard language model (a BART LM) auto-regressively generates elemental discourse unit (EDU) content plans with an extractive copy mechanism. The top K beams from the content plan generator are then used to guide a separate LM, which produces a single abstractive candidate for each distinct plan. We apply an existing re-ranker (BRIO) to abstractive candidates generated from our method, as well as baseline decoding methods. We show large relevance improvements over previously published methods on widely used single document news article corpora, with ROUGE-2 F1 gains of 0.88, 2.01, and 0.38 on CNN / Dailymail, NYT, and Xsum, respectively. A human evaluation on CNN / DM validates these results. Similarly, on 1k samples from CNN / DM, we show that prompting GPT-3 to follow EDU plans outperforms sampling-based methods by 1.05 ROUGE-2 F1 points. Code to generate and realize plans is available at https://github.com/griff4692/edu-sum.

**Title:** Visual Affordance Prediction for Guiding Robot Exploration  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17783  
**Abstract:** Motivated by the intuitive understanding humans have about the space of possible interactions, and the ease with which they can generalize this understanding to previously unseen scenes, we develop an approach for learning visual affordances for guiding robot exploration. Given an input image of a scene, we infer a distribution over plausible future states that can be achieved via interactions with it. We use a Transformer-based model to learn a conditional distribution in the latent embedding space of a VQ-VAE and show that these models can be trained using large-scale and diverse passive data, and that the learned models exhibit compositional generalization to diverse objects beyond the training distribution. We show how the trained affordance model can be used for guiding exploration by acting as a goal-sampling distribution, during visual goal-conditioned policy learning in robotic manipulation.

**Title:** ConvGenVisMo: Evaluation of Conversational Generative Vision Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17784  
**Abstract:** Conversational generative vision models (CGVMs) like Visual ChatGPT (Wu et al., 2023) have recently emerged from the synthesis of computer vision and natural language processing techniques. These models enable more natural and interactive communication between humans and machines, because they can understand verbal inputs from users and generate responses in natural language along with visual outputs. To make informed decisions about the usage and deployment of these models, it is important to analyze their performance through a suitable evaluation framework on realistic datasets. In this paper, we present ConvGenVisMo, a framework for the novel task of evaluating CGVMs. ConvGenVisMo introduces a new benchmark evaluation dataset for this task, and also provides a suite of existing and new automated evaluation metrics to evaluate the outputs. All ConvGenVisMo assets, including the dataset and the evaluation code, will be made available publicly on GitHub.

**Title:** Large Language Models, scientific knowledge and factuality: A systematic  analysis in antibiotic discovery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17819  
**Abstract:** Inferring over and extracting information from Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on a large corpus of scientific literature can potentially drive a new era in biomedical research, reducing the barriers for accessing existing medical evidence. This work examines the potential of LLMs for dialoguing with biomedical background knowledge, using the context of antibiotic discovery as an exemplar motivational scenario. The context of biomedical discovery from natural products entails understanding the relational evidence between an organism, an associated chemical and its associated antibiotic properties. We provide a systematic assessment on the ability of LLMs to encode and express these relations, verifying for fluency, prompt-alignment, semantic coherence, factual knowledge and specificity of generated responses. The systematic analysis is applied to nine state-of-the-art models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4) in two prompting-based tasks: chemical compound definition generation and chemical compound-fungus relation determination. Results show that while recent models have improved in fluency, factual accuracy is still low and models are biased towards over-represented entities. The ability of LLMs to serve as biomedical knowledge bases is questioned, and the need for additional systematic evaluation frameworks is highlighted. The best performing GPT-4 produced a factual definition for 70% of chemical compounds and 43.6% factual relations to fungi, whereas the best open source model BioGPT-large 30% of the compounds and 30% of the relations for the best-performing prompt. The results show that while LLMs are currently not fit for purpose to be used as biomedical factual knowledge bases, there is a promising emerging property in the direction of factuality as the models become domain specialised, scale-up in size and level of human feedback.

**Title:** Streaming Audio Transformers for Online Audio Tagging  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17834  
**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a prominent model framework for audio tagging (AT), boasting state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the widely-used Audioset dataset. However, their impressive performance often comes at the cost of high memory usage, slow inference speed, and considerable model delay, rendering them impractical for real-world AT applications. In this study, we introduce streaming audio transformers (SAT) that combine the vision transformer (ViT) architecture with Transformer-Xl-like chunk processing, enabling efficient processing of long-range audio signals. Our proposed SAT is benchmarked against other transformer-based SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision (mAP) at a delay of 2s and 1s, while also exhibiting significantly lower memory usage and computational overhead. Checkpoints are publicly available https://github.com/RicherMans/SAT.

**Title:** SPAC-Net: Synthetic Pose-aware Animal ControlNet for Enhanced Pose  Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17845  
**Abstract:** Animal pose estimation has become a crucial area of research, but the scarcity of annotated data is a significant challenge in developing accurate models. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative, but it frequently exhibits domain discrepancies with real data. Style transfer algorithms have been proposed to address this issue, but they suffer from insufficient spatial correspondence, leading to the loss of label information. In this work, we present a new approach called Synthetic Pose-aware Animal ControlNet (SPAC-Net), which incorporates ControlNet into the previously proposed Prior-Aware Synthetic animal data generation (PASyn) pipeline. We leverage the plausible pose data generated by the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)-based data generation pipeline as input for the ControlNet Holistically-nested Edge Detection (HED) boundary task model to generate synthetic data with pose labels that are closer to real data, making it possible to train a high-precision pose estimation network without the need for real data. In addition, we propose the Bi-ControlNet structure to separately detect the HED boundary of animals and backgrounds, improving the precision and stability of the generated data. Using the SPAC-Net pipeline, we generate synthetic zebra and rhino images and test them on the AP10K real dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to using only real images or synthetic data generated by other methods. Our work demonstrates the potential for synthetic data to overcome the challenge of limited annotated data in animal pose estimation.

**Title:** GridFormer: Residual Dense Transformer with Grid Structure for Image  Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17863  
**Abstract:** Image restoration in adverse weather conditions is a difficult task in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework called GridFormer which serves as a backbone for image restoration under adverse weather conditions. GridFormer is designed in a grid structure using a residual dense transformer block, and it introduces two core designs. First, it uses an enhanced attention mechanism in the transformer layer. The mechanism includes stages of the sampler and compact self-attention to improve efficiency, and a local enhancement stage to strengthen local information. Second, we introduce a residual dense transformer block (RDTB) as the final GridFormer layer. This design further improves the network's ability to learn effective features from both preceding and current local features. The GridFormer framework achieves state-of-the-art results on five diverse image restoration tasks in adverse weather conditions, including image deraining, dehazing, deraining & dehazing, desnowing, and multi-weather restoration. The source code and pre-trained models will be released.

**Title:** NaturalFinger: Generating Natural Fingerprint with Generative  Adversarial Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17868  
**Abstract:** Deep neural network (DNN) models have become a critical asset of the model owner as training them requires a large amount of resource (i.e. labeled data). Therefore, many fingerprinting schemes have been proposed to safeguard the intellectual property (IP) of the model owner against model extraction and illegal redistribution. However, previous schemes adopt unnatural images as the fingerprint, such as adversarial examples and noisy images, which can be easily perceived and rejected by the adversary. In this paper, we propose NaturalFinger which generates natural fingerprint with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Besides, our proposed NaturalFinger fingerprints the decision difference areas rather than the decision boundary, which is more robust. The application of GAN not only allows us to generate more imperceptible samples, but also enables us to generate unrestricted samples to explore the decision boundary.To demonstrate the effectiveness of our fingerprint approach, we evaluate our approach against four model modification attacks including adversarial training and two model extraction attacks. Experiments show that our approach achieves 0.91 ARUC value on the FingerBench dataset (154 models), exceeding the optimal baseline (MetaV) over 17\%.

**Title:** The Rise of AI Language Pathologists: Exploring Two-level Prompt  Learning for Few-shot Weakly-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17891  
**Abstract:** This paper introduces the novel concept of few-shot weakly supervised learning for pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, denoted as FSWC. A solution is proposed based on prompt learning and the utilization of a large language model, GPT-4. Since a WSI is too large and needs to be divided into patches for processing, WSI classification is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. In this context, each WSI is considered a bag, and the obtained patches are treated as instances. The objective of FSWC is to classify both bags and instances with only a limited number of labeled bags. Unlike conventional few-shot learning problems, FSWC poses additional challenges due to its weak bag labels within the MIL framework. Drawing inspiration from the recent achievements of vision-language models (V-L models) in downstream few-shot classification tasks, we propose a two-level prompt learning MIL framework tailored for pathology, incorporating language prior knowledge. Specifically, we leverage CLIP to extract instance features for each patch, and introduce a prompt-guided pooling strategy to aggregate these instance features into a bag feature. Subsequently, we employ a small number of labeled bags to facilitate few-shot prompt learning based on the bag features. Our approach incorporates the utilization of GPT-4 in a question-and-answer mode to obtain language prior knowledge at both the instance and bag levels, which are then integrated into the instance and bag level language prompts. Additionally, a learnable component of the language prompts is trained using the available few-shot labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three real WSI datasets encompassing breast cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer, demonstrating the notable performance of the proposed method in bag and instance classification. All codes will be made publicly accessible.

**Title:** Deeply Coupled Cross-Modal Prompt Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17903  
**Abstract:** Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have excelled in zero-shot generalization. Prompt tuning involved in the knowledge transfer from foundation models to downstream tasks has gained significant attention recently. Existing prompt-tuning methods in cross-modal learning, however, either solely focus on language branch, or learn vision-language interaction in a shallow mechanism. In this context, we propose a Deeply coupled Cross-modal Prompt learning (DCP) method based on CLIP. DCP flexibly accommodates the interplay between vision and language with a Cross-Modal Prompt Attention (CMPA) mechanism, which enables the mutual exchange of respective representation through a well-connected multi-head attention module progressively and strongly. We then conduct comprehensive few-shot learning experiments on 11 image classification datasets and analyze the robustness to domain shift as well. Thorough experimental analysis evidently demonstrates the superb few-shot generalization and compelling domain adaption capacity of a well-executed DCP. The code can be found at \href{https://github.com/GingL/CMPA}{https://github.com/GingL/CMPA}.

**Title:** Volume Feature Rendering for Fast Neural Radiance Field Reconstruction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17916  
**Abstract:** Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are able to synthesize realistic novel views from multi-view images captured from distinct positions and perspectives. In NeRF's rendering pipeline, neural networks are used to represent a scene independently or transform queried learnable feature vector of a point to the expected color or density. With the aid of geometry guides either in occupancy grids or proposal networks, the number of neural network evaluations can be reduced from hundreds to dozens in the standard volume rendering framework. Instead of rendering yielded color after neural network evaluation, we propose to render the queried feature vectors of a ray first and then transform the rendered feature vector to the final pixel color by a neural network. This fundamental change to the standard volume rendering framework requires only one single neural network evaluation to render a pixel, which substantially lowers the high computational complexity of the rendering framework attributed to a large number of neural network evaluations. Consequently, we can use a comparably larger neural network to achieve a better rendering quality while maintaining the same training and rendering time costs. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art rendering quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets while requiring a training time of several minutes.

**Title:** Large Language Models are not Fair Evaluators  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17926  
**Abstract:** We uncover a systematic bias in the evaluation paradigm of adopting large language models~(LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, as a referee to score the quality of responses generated by candidate models. We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., vicuna could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries. To address this issue, we propose two simple yet effective calibration strategies: 1) Multiple Evidence Calibration, which requires the evaluator model to generate multiple detailed pieces of evidence before assigning ratings; 2) Balanced Position Calibration, which aggregates results across various orders to determine the final score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments. To facilitate future research on more robust large language model comparison, we integrate the techniques in the paper into an easy-to-use toolkit \emph{FairEval}, along with the human annotations.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/i-Eval/FairEval}}

**Title:** CamoDiffusion: Camouflaged Object Detection via Conditional Diffusion  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17932  
**Abstract:** Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is a challenging task in computer vision due to the high similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings. Existing COD methods primarily employ semantic segmentation, which suffers from overconfident incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that treats COD as a conditional mask-generation task leveraging diffusion models. Our method, dubbed CamoDiffusion, employs the denoising process of diffusion models to iteratively reduce the noise of the mask. Due to the stochastic sampling process of diffusion, our model is capable of sampling multiple possible predictions from the mask distribution, avoiding the problem of overconfident point estimation. Moreover, we develop specialized learning strategies that include an innovative ensemble approach for generating robust predictions and tailored forward diffusion methods for efficient training, specifically for the COD task. Extensive experiments on three COD datasets attest the superior performance of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly on the most challenging COD10K dataset, where our approach achieves 0.019 in terms of MAE.

**Title:** DiffRate : Differentiable Compression Rate for Efficient Vision  Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17997  
**Abstract:** Token compression aims to speed up large-scale vision transformers (e.g. ViTs) by pruning (dropping) or merging tokens. It is an important but challenging task. Although recent advanced approaches achieved great success, they need to carefully handcraft a compression rate (i.e. number of tokens to remove), which is tedious and leads to sub-optimal performance. To tackle this problem, we propose Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate), a novel token compression method that has several appealing properties prior arts do not have. First, DiffRate enables propagating the loss function's gradient onto the compression ratio, which is considered as a non-differentiable hyperparameter in previous work. In this case, different layers can automatically learn different compression rates layer-wisely without extra overhead. Second, token pruning and merging can be naturally performed simultaneously in DiffRate, while they were isolated in previous works. Third, extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffRate achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, by applying the learned layer-wise compression rates to an off-the-shelf ViT-H (MAE) model, we achieve a 40% FLOPs reduction and a 1.5x throughput improvement, with a minor accuracy drop of 0.16% on ImageNet without fine-tuning, even outperforming previous methods with fine-tuning. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/DiffRate.

**Title:** Conditional Score Guidance for Text-Driven Image-to-Image Translation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18007  
**Abstract:** We present a novel algorithm for text-driven image-to-image translation based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model. Our method aims to generate a target image by selectively editing the regions of interest in a source image, defined by a modifying text, while preserving the remaining parts. In contrast to existing techniques that solely rely on a target prompt, we introduce a new score function, which considers both a source prompt and a source image, tailored to address specific translation tasks. To this end, we derive the conditional score function in a principled manner, decomposing it into a standard score and a guiding term for target image generation. For the gradient computation, we adopt a Gaussian distribution of the posterior distribution, estimating its mean and variance without requiring additional training. In addition, to enhance the conditional score guidance, we incorporate a simple yet effective mixup method. This method combines two cross-attention maps derived from the source and target latents, promoting the generation of the target image by a desirable fusion of the original parts in the source image and the edited regions aligned with the target prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves outstanding image-to-image translation performance on various tasks.

**Title:** Multi-Modal Face Stylization with a Generative Prior  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18009  
**Abstract:** In this work, we introduce a new approach for artistic face stylization. Despite existing methods achieving impressive results in this task, there is still room for improvement in generating high-quality stylized faces with diverse styles and accurate facial reconstruction. Our proposed framework, MMFS, supports multi-modal face stylization by leveraging the strengths of StyleGAN and integrates it into an encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we use the mid-resolution and high-resolution layers of StyleGAN as the decoder to generate high-quality faces, while aligning its low-resolution layer with the encoder to extract and preserve input facial details. We also introduce a two-stage training strategy, where we train the encoder in the first stage to align the feature maps with StyleGAN and enable a faithful reconstruction of input faces. In the second stage, the entire network is fine-tuned with artistic data for stylized face generation. To enable the fine-tuned model to be applied in zero-shot and one-shot stylization tasks, we train an additional mapping network from the large-scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training (CLIP) space to a latent $w+$ space of fine-tuned StyleGAN. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our framework achieves superior face stylization performance in both one-shot and zero-shot stylization tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

**Title:** Test-Time Adaptation with CLIP Reward for Zero-Shot Generalization in  Vision-Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18010  
**Abstract:** Misalignment between the outputs of a vision-language (VL) model and task goal hinders its deployment. This issue can worsen when there are distribution shifts between the training and test data. To address this problem, prevailing fully test-time adaptation~(TTA) methods bootstrap themselves through entropy minimization. However, minimizing the entropy of the predictions makes the model overfit to incorrect output distributions of itself. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to avoid such overfitting and align the model with task goals. Specifically, we adopt CLIP as reward model to provide feedback for VL models during test time in various tasks, including image classification, image-text retrieval, and image captioning. Given a single test sample, the model aims to maximize CLIP reward through reinforcement learning. We adopt a reward design with the average CLIP score of sampled candidates as the baseline. This design is simple and surprisingly effective when combined with various task-specific sampling strategies. The entire system is flexible, allowing the reward model to be extended with multiple CLIP models. Plus, a momentum buffer can be used to memorize and leverage the learned knowledge from multiple test samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves different VL models after TTA.

**Title:** TReR: A Lightweight Transformer Re-Ranking Approach for 3D LiDAR Place  Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18013  
**Abstract:** Autonomous driving systems often require reliable loop closure detection to guarantee reduced localization drift. Recently, 3D LiDAR-based localization methods have used retrieval-based place recognition to find revisited places efficiently. However, when deployed in challenging real-world scenarios, the place recognition models become more complex, which comes at the cost of high computational demand. This work tackles this problem from an information-retrieval perspective, adopting a first-retrieve-then-re-ranking paradigm, where an initial loop candidate ranking, generated from a 3D place recognition model, is re-ordered by a proposed lightweight transformer-based re-ranking approach (TReR). The proposed approach relies on global descriptors only, being agnostic to the place recognition model. The experimental evaluation, conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset, where we compared TReR with s.o.t.a. re-ranking approaches such as alphaQE and SGV, indicate the robustness and efficiency when compared to alphaQE while offering a good trade-off between robustness and efficiency when compared to SGV.

**Title:** HGT: A Hierarchical GCN-Based Transformer for Multimodal Periprosthetic  Joint Infection Diagnosis Using CT Images and Text  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18022  
**Abstract:** Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a prevalent and severe complication characterized by high diagnostic challenges. Currently, a unified diagnostic standard incorporating both computed tomography (CT) images and numerical text data for PJI remains unestablished, owing to the substantial noise in CT images and the disparity in data volume between CT images and text data. This study introduces a diagnostic method, HGT, based on deep learning and multimodal techniques. It effectively merges features from CT scan images and patients' numerical text data via a Unidirectional Selective Attention (USA) mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based feature fusion network. We evaluated the proposed method on a custom-built multimodal PJI dataset, assessing its performance through ablation experiments and interpretability evaluations. Our method achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 91.4\% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.9\%, outperforming recent multimodal approaches by 2.9\% in ACC and 2.2\% in AUC, with a parameter count of only 68M. Notably, the interpretability results highlighted our model's strong focus and localization capabilities at lesion sites. This proposed method could provide clinicians with additional diagnostic tools to enhance accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice.

**Title:** Abstractive Summarization as Augmentation for Document-Level Event  Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18023  
**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have consistently produced substantial performance gains across a variety of NLP tasks, compared to shallow models. However, deep models are orders of magnitude more computationally expensive than shallow models, especially on tasks with large sequence lengths, such as document-level event detection. In this work, we attempt to bridge the performance gap between shallow and deep models on document-level event detection by using abstractive text summarization as an augmentation method. We augment the DocEE dataset by generating abstractive summaries of examples from low-resource classes. For classification, we use linear SVM with TF-IDF representations and RoBERTa-base. We use BART for zero-shot abstractive summarization, making our augmentation setup less resource-intensive compared to supervised fine-tuning. We experiment with four decoding methods for text generation, namely beam search, top-k sampling, top-p sampling, and contrastive search. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of using document titles as additional input for classification. Our results show that using the document title offers 2.04% and 3.19% absolute improvement in macro F1-score for linear SVM and RoBERTa, respectively. Augmentation via summarization further improves the performance of linear SVM by about 0.5%, varying slightly across decoding methods. Overall, our augmentation setup yields insufficient improvements for linear SVM compared to RoBERTa.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18034  
**Abstract:** We present a novel corpus for subjectivity detection at the sentence level. We develop new annotation guidelines for the task, which are not limited to language-specific cues, and apply them to produce a new corpus in English. The corpus consists of 411 subjective and 638 objective sentences extracted from ongoing coverage of political affairs from online news outlets. This new resource paves the way for the development of models for subjectivity detection in English and across other languages, without relying on language-specific tools like lexicons or machine translation. We evaluate state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models on the task, both in mono- and cross-lingual settings, the latter with a similar existing corpus in Italian language. We observe that enriching our corpus with resources in other languages improves the results on the task.

**Title:** InstructEdit: Improving Automatic Masks for Diffusion-based Image  Editing With User Instructions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18047  
**Abstract:** Recent works have explored text-guided image editing using diffusion models and generated edited images based on text prompts. However, the models struggle to accurately locate the regions to be edited and faithfully perform precise edits. In this work, we propose a framework termed InstructEdit that can do fine-grained editing based on user instructions. Our proposed framework has three components: language processor, segmenter, and image editor. The first component, the language processor, processes the user instruction using a large language model. The goal of this processing is to parse the user instruction and output prompts for the segmenter and captions for the image editor. We adopt ChatGPT and optionally BLIP2 for this step. The second component, the segmenter, uses the segmentation prompt provided by the language processor. We employ a state-of-the-art segmentation framework Grounded Segment Anything to automatically generate a high-quality mask based on the segmentation prompt. The third component, the image editor, uses the captions from the language processor and the masks from the segmenter to compute the edited image. We adopt Stable Diffusion and the mask-guided generation from DiffEdit for this purpose. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous editing methods in fine-grained editing applications where the input image contains a complex object or multiple objects. We improve the mask quality over DiffEdit and thus improve the quality of edited images. We also show that our framework can accept multiple forms of user instructions as input. We provide the code at https://github.com/QianWangX/InstructEdit.

**Title:** Convergence analysis of an explicit method and its random batch  approximation for the McKean-Vlasov equations with non-globally Lipschitz  conditions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18054  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a numerical approach to solve the McKean-Vlasov equations, which are distribution-dependent stochastic differential equations, under some non-globally Lipschitz conditions for both the drift and diffusion coefficients. We establish a propagation of chaos result, based on which the McKean-Vlasov equation is approximated by an interacting particle system. A truncated Euler scheme is then proposed for the interacting particle system allowing for a Khasminskii-type condition on the coefficients. To reduce the computational cost, the random batch approximation proposed in [Jin et al., J. Comput. Phys., 400(1), 2020] is extended to the interacting particle system where the interaction could take place in the diffusion term. An almost half order of convergence is proved in $L^p$ sense. Numerical tests are performed to verify the theoretical results.

**Title:** Text-Only Image Captioning with Multi-Context Data Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18072  
**Abstract:** Text-only Image Captioning (TIC) is an approach that aims to construct a model solely based on text that can accurately describe images. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images that are semantically coherent with given texts. This presents an opportunity to generate synthetic training images for TIC. However, we have identified a challenge that the images generated from simple descriptions typically exhibit a single perspective with one or limited contexts, which is not aligned with the complexity of real-world scenes in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses this issue by introducing multi-context data generation. Starting with an initial text corpus, our framework employs a large language model to select multiple sentences that describe the same scene from various perspectives. These sentences are then summarized into a single sentence with multiple contexts. We generate simple images using the straightforward sentences and complex images using the summarized sentences through diffusion models. Finally, we train the model exclusively using the synthetic image-text pairs obtained from this process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively tackles the central challenge we have identified, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets such as MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and SS1M.

**Title:** Towards a Robust Framework for NeRF Evaluation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18079  
**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) research has attracted significant attention recently, with 3D modelling, virtual/augmented reality, and visual effects driving its application. While current NeRF implementations can produce high quality visual results, there is a conspicuous lack of reliable methods for evaluating them. Conventional image quality assessment methods and analytical metrics (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS etc.) only provide approximate indicators of performance since they generalise the ability of the entire NeRF pipeline. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new test framework which isolates the neural rendering network from the NeRF pipeline and then performs a parametric evaluation by training and evaluating the NeRF on an explicit radiance field representation. We also introduce a configurable approach for generating representations specifically for evaluation purposes. This employs ray-casting to transform mesh models into explicit NeRF samples, as well as to "shade" these representations. Combining these two approaches, we demonstrate how different "tasks" (scenes with different visual effects or learning strategies) and types of networks (NeRFs and depth-wise implicit neural representations (INRs)) can be evaluated within this framework. Additionally, we propose a novel metric to measure task complexity of the framework which accounts for the visual parameters and the distribution of the spatial data. Our approach offers the potential to create a comparative objective evaluation framework for NeRF methods.

**Title:** Game of Tones: Faculty detection of GPT-4 generated content in  university assessments  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18081  
**Abstract:** This study explores the robustness of university assessments against the use of Open AI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) generated content and evaluates the ability of academic staff to detect its use when supported by the Turnitin Artificial Intelligence (AI) detection tool. The research involved twenty-two GPT-4 generated submissions being created and included in the assessment process to be marked by fifteen different faculty members. The study reveals that although the detection tool identified 91% of the experimental submissions as containing some AI-generated content, the total detected content was only 54.8%. This suggests that the use of adversarial techniques regarding prompt engineering is an effective method in evading AI detection tools and highlights that improvements to AI detection software are needed. Using the Turnitin AI detect tool, faculty reported 54.5% of the experimental submissions to the academic misconduct process, suggesting the need for increased awareness and training into these tools. Genuine submissions received a mean score of 54.4, whereas AI-generated content scored 52.3, indicating the comparable performance of GPT-4 in real-life situations. Recommendations include adjusting assessment strategies to make them more resistant to the use of AI tools, using AI-inclusive assessment where possible, and providing comprehensive training programs for faculty and students. This research contributes to understanding the relationship between AI-generated content and academic assessment, urging further investigation to preserve academic integrity.

**Title:** Assess and Summarize: Improve Outage Understanding with Large Language  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18084  
**Abstract:** Cloud systems have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their flexibility and scalability. Each time cloud computing applications and services hosted on the cloud are affected by a cloud outage, users can experience slow response times, connection issues or total service disruption, resulting in a significant negative business impact. Outages are usually comprised of several concurring events/source causes, and therefore understanding the context of outages is a very challenging yet crucial first step toward mitigating and resolving outages. In current practice, on-call engineers with in-depth domain knowledge, have to manually assess and summarize outages when they happen, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we first present a large-scale empirical study investigating the way on-call engineers currently deal with cloud outages at Microsoft, and then present and empirically validate a novel approach (dubbed Oasis) to help the engineers in this task. Oasis is able to automatically assess the impact scope of outages as well as to produce human-readable summarization. Specifically, Oasis first assesses the impact scope of an outage by aggregating relevant incidents via multiple techniques. Then, it generates a human-readable summary by leveraging fine-tuned large language models like GPT-3.x. The impact assessment component of Oasis was introduced in Microsoft over three years ago, and it is now widely adopted, while the outage summarization component has been recently introduced, and in this article we present the results of an empirical evaluation we carried out on 18 real-world cloud systems as well as a human-based evaluation with outage owners. The results show that Oasis can effectively and efficiently summarize outages, and lead Microsoft to deploy its first prototype which is currently under experimental adoption by some of the incident teams.

**Title:** BigTrans: Augmenting Large Language Models with Multilingual Translation  Capability over 100 Languages  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18098  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising translation performance among various natural languages. However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTrans which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTrans is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTrans model. The preliminary experiments on multilingual translation show that BigTrans performs comparably with ChatGPT and Google Translate in many languages and even outperforms ChatGPT in 8 language pairs. We release the BigTrans model and hope it can advance the research progress.

**Title:** Writing user personas with Large Language Models: Testing phase 6 of a  Thematic Analysis of semi-structured interviews  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18099  
**Abstract:** The goal of this paper is establishing if we can satisfactorily perform a Thematic Analysis (TA) of semi-structured interviews using a Large Language Model (more precisely GPT3.5-Turbo). Building on previous work by the author, which established an embryonal process for conducting a TA with the model, this paper will perform a further analysis and then cover the last phase of a TA (phase 6), which entails the writing up of the result. This phase was not covered by the previous work. In particular, the focus will be on using the results of a TA done with the LLM on a dataset of user interviews, for writing user personas, with the model building on the TA to produce the personas narratives. User personas are models of real users, usually built from a data analysis like interviews with a sample of users. User personas are tools often used in User Centered Design processes. The paper shows that the model can build basic user personas with an acceptable quality deriving them from themes, and that the model can serve for the generation of ideas for user personas.

**Title:** TD-GEM: Text-Driven Garment Editing Mapper  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18120  
**Abstract:** Language-based fashion image editing allows users to try out variations of desired garments through provided text prompts. Inspired by research on manipulating latent representations in StyleCLIP and HairCLIP, we focus on these latent spaces for editing fashion items of full-body human datasets. Currently, there is a gap in handling fashion image editing due to the complexity of garment shapes and textures and the diversity of human poses. In this paper, we propose an editing optimizer scheme method called Text-Driven Garment Editing Mapper (TD-GEM), aiming to edit fashion items in a disentangled way. To this end, we initially obtain a latent representation of an image through generative adversarial network inversions such as Encoder for Editing (e4e) or Pivotal Tuning Inversion (PTI) for more accurate results. An optimization-based Contrasive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is then utilized to guide the latent representation of a fashion image in the direction of a target attribute expressed in terms of a text prompt. Our TD-GEM manipulates the image accurately according to the target attribute, while other parts of the image are kept untouched. In the experiments, we evaluate TD-GEM on two different attributes (i.e., "color" and "sleeve length"), which effectively generates realistic images compared to the recent manipulation schemes.

**Title:** Alignment-free HDR Deghosting with Semantics Consistent Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18135  
**Abstract:** High dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to retrieve information from multiple low-dynamic range inputs to generate realistic output. The essence is to leverage the contextual information, including both dynamic and static semantics, for better image generation. Existing methods often focus on the spatial misalignment across input frames caused by the foreground and/or camera motion. However, there is no research on jointly leveraging the dynamic and static context in a simultaneous manner. To delve into this problem, we propose a novel alignment-free network with a Semantics Consistent Transformer (SCTNet) with both spatial and channel attention modules in the network. The spatial attention aims to deal with the intra-image correlation to model the dynamic motion, while the channel attention enables the inter-image intertwining to enhance the semantic consistency across frames. Aside from this, we introduce a novel realistic HDR dataset with more variations in foreground objects, environmental factors, and larger motions. Extensive comparisons on both conventional datasets and ours validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best trade-off on the performance and the computational cost.

**Title:** Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled Detection of AI-Generated Texts  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18149  
**Abstract:** Recent releases of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT, are astonishing at generating human-like texts, but they may get misused for fake scholarly texts, fake news, fake tweets, et cetera. Previous works have proposed methods to detect these multiscale AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based training-agnostic methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors are formulated without considering the factor of corpus length: shorter corpuses are harder to detect compared with longer ones for shortage of informative features. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the challenge of multiscale text detection. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase text classification as a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by marking these short machine texts as "unlabeled" during training. In this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where we use a recurrent model in abstraction to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpuses. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpuses. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated text, and significantly improves short-corpus detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors by large margins on multiscale AI-generated texts.

**Title:** Do Large Language Models Know What They Don't Know?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18153  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have a wealth of knowledge that allows them to excel in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Current research focuses on enhancing their performance within their existing knowledge. Despite their vast knowledge, LLMs are still limited by the amount of information they can accommodate and comprehend. Therefore, the ability to understand their own limitations on the unknows, referred to as self-knowledge, is of paramount importance. This study aims to evaluate LLMs' self-knowledge by assessing their ability to identify unanswerable or unknowable questions. We introduce an automated methodology to detect uncertainty in the responses of these models, providing a novel measure of their self-knowledge. We further introduce a unique dataset, SelfAware, consisting of unanswerable questions from five diverse categories and their answerable counterparts. Our extensive analysis, involving 20 LLMs including GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA, discovering an intrinsic capacity for self-knowledge within these models. Moreover, we demonstrate that in-context learning and instruction tuning can further enhance this self-knowledge. Despite this promising insight, our findings also highlight a considerable gap between the capabilities of these models and human proficiency in recognizing the limits of their knowledge.

**Title:** Exploring Effectiveness of GPT-3 in Grammatical Error Correction: A  Study on Performance and Controllability in Prompt-Based Methods  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18156  
**Abstract:** Large-scale pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, applying prompt-based methods with GPT-3 for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) tasks and their controllability remains underexplored. Controllability in GEC is crucial for real-world applications, particularly in educational settings, where the ability to tailor feedback according to learner levels and specific error types can significantly enhance the learning process. This paper investigates the performance and controllability of prompt-based methods with GPT-3 for GEC tasks using zero-shot and few-shot setting. We explore the impact of task instructions and examples on GPT-3's output, focusing on controlling aspects such as minimal edits, fluency edits, and learner levels. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-3 could effectively perform GEC tasks, outperforming existing supervised and unsupervised approaches. We also showed that GPT-3 could achieve controllability when appropriate task instructions and examples are given.

**Title:** LM-CPPF: Paraphrasing-Guided Data Augmentation for Contrastive  Prompt-Based Few-Shot Fine-Tuning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18169  
**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing pre-trained language models for NLP. However, these models often struggle when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision, effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B, for data augmentation. Our experiments on multiple text classification benchmarks show that this augmentation method outperforms other methods, such as easy data augmentation, back translation, and multiple templates.

**Title:** Syntax and Semantics Meet in the "Middle": Probing the Syntax-Semantics  Interface of LMs Through Agentivity  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18185  
**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models have prompted researchers to examine their abilities across a variety of linguistic tasks, but little has been done to investigate how models handle the interactions in meaning across words and larger syntactic forms -- i.e. phenomena at the intersection of syntax and semantics. We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions. We created a novel evaluation dataset by utilitizing the unique linguistic properties of a subset of optionally transitive English verbs. This dataset was used to prompt varying sizes of three model classes to see if they are sensitive to agentivity at the lexical level, and if they can appropriately employ these word-level priors given a specific syntactic context. Overall, GPT-3 text-davinci-003 performs extremely well across all experiments, outperforming all other models tested by far. In fact, the results are even better correlated with human judgements than both syntactic and semantic corpus statistics. This suggests that LMs may potentially serve as more useful tools for linguistic annotation, theory testing, and discovery than select corpora for certain tasks.

**Title:** Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes  in Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18189  
**Abstract:** To recognize and mitigate harms from large language models (LLMs), we need to understand the prevalence and nuances of stereotypes in LLM outputs. Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women. These representational harms have concerning implications for downstream applications like story generation.

**Title:** HowkGPT: Investigating the Detection of ChatGPT-generated University  Student Homework through Context-Aware Perplexity Analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18226  
**Abstract:** As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation tasks proliferates, concerns arise over their potential to compromise academic integrity. The education sector currently tussles with distinguishing student-authored homework assignments from AI-generated ones. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing HowkGPT, designed to identify homework assignments generated by AI. HowkGPT is built upon a dataset of academic assignments and accompanying metadata [17] and employs a pretrained LLM to compute perplexity scores for student-authored and ChatGPT-generated responses. These scores then assist in establishing a threshold for discerning the origin of a submitted assignment. Given the specificity and contextual nature of academic work, HowkGPT further refines its analysis by defining category-specific thresholds derived from the metadata, enhancing the precision of the detection. This study emphasizes the critical need for effective strategies to uphold academic integrity amidst the growing influence of LLMs and provides an approach to ensuring fair and accurate grading in educational institutions.

**Title:** Practical PCG Through Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18243  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven to be useful tools in various domains outside of the field of their inception, which was natural language processing. In this study, we provide practical directions on how to use LLMs to generate 2D-game rooms for an under-development game, named Metavoidal. Our technique can harness the power of GPT-3 by Human-in-the-loop fine-tuning which allows our method to create 37% Playable-Novel levels from as scarce data as only 60 hand-designed rooms under a scenario of the non-trivial game, with respect to (Procedural Content Generation) PCG, that has a good amount of local and global constraints.

**Title:** Do Language Models Know When They're Hallucinating References?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18248  
**Abstract:** Current state-of-the-art language models (LMs) are notorious for generating text with "hallucinations," a primary example being book and paper references that lack any solid basis in their training data. However, we find that many of these fabrications can be identified using the same LM, using only black-box queries without consulting any external resources. Consistency checks done with direct queries about whether the generated reference title is real (inspired by Kadavath et al. 2022, Lin et al. 2022, Manakul et al. 2023) are compared to consistency checks with indirect queries which ask for ancillary details such as the authors of the work. These consistency checks are found to be partially reliable indicators of whether or not the reference is a hallucination. In particular, we find that LMs in the GPT-series will hallucinate differing authors of hallucinated references when queried in independent sessions, while it will consistently identify authors of real references. This suggests that the hallucination may be more a result of generation techniques than the underlying representation.

**Title:** Representation Learning on Hyper-Relational and Numeric Knowledge Graphs  with Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18256  
**Abstract:** A hyper-relational knowledge graph has been recently studied where a triplet is associated with a set of qualifiers; a qualifier is composed of a relation and an entity, providing auxiliary information for a triplet. While existing hyper-relational knowledge graph embedding methods assume that the entities are discrete objects, some information should be represented using numeric values, e.g., (J.R.R., was born in, 1892). Also, a triplet (J.R.R., educated at, Oxford Univ.) can be associated with a qualifier such as (start time, 1911). In this paper, we propose a unified framework named HyNT that learns representations of a hyper-relational knowledge graph containing numeric literals in either triplets or qualifiers. We define a context transformer and a prediction transformer to learn the representations based not only on the correlations between a triplet and its qualifiers but also on the numeric information. By learning compact representations of triplets and qualifiers and feeding them into the transformers, we reduce the computation cost of using transformers. Using HyNT, we can predict missing numeric values in addition to missing entities or relations in a hyper-relational knowledge graph. Experimental results show that HyNT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.

**Title:** GlyphControl: Glyph Conditional Control for Visual Text Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18259  
**Abstract:** Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based text-to-image generative models capable of generating coherent and well-formed visual text. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient approach called GlyphControl to address this task. Unlike existing methods that rely on character-aware text encoders like ByT5 and require retraining of text-to-image models, our approach leverages additional glyph conditional information to enhance the performance of the off-the-shelf Stable-Diffusion model in generating accurate visual text. By incorporating glyph instructions, users can customize the content, location, and size of the generated text according to their specific requirements. To facilitate further research in visual text generation, we construct a training benchmark dataset called LAION-Glyph. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by measuring OCR-based metrics and CLIP scores of the generated visual text. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GlyphControl outperforms the recent DeepFloyd IF approach in terms of OCR accuracy and CLIP scores, highlighting the efficacy of our method.

**Title:** Gen-L-Video: Multi-Text to Long Video Generation via Temporal  Co-Denoising  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18264  
**Abstract:** Leveraging large-scale image-text datasets and advancements in diffusion models, text-driven generative models have made remarkable strides in the field of image generation and editing. This study explores the potential of extending the text-driven ability to the generation and editing of multi-text conditioned long videos. Current methodologies for video generation and editing, while innovative, are often confined to extremely short videos (typically less than 24 frames) and are limited to a single text condition. These constraints significantly limit their applications given that real-world videos usually consist of multiple segments, each bearing different semantic information. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel paradigm dubbed as Gen-L-Video, capable of extending off-the-shelf short video diffusion models for generating and editing videos comprising hundreds of frames with diverse semantic segments without introducing additional training, all while preserving content consistency. We have implemented three mainstream text-driven video generation and editing methodologies and extended them to accommodate longer videos imbued with a variety of semantic segments with our proposed paradigm. Our experimental outcomes reveal that our approach significantly broadens the generative and editing capabilities of video diffusion models, offering new possibilities for future research and applications. The code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/Gen-L-Video.

**Title:** Check-COVID: Fact-Checking COVID-19 News Claims with Scientific Evidence  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18265  
**Abstract:** We present a new fact-checking benchmark, Check-COVID, that requires systems to verify claims about COVID-19 from news using evidence from scientific articles. This approach to fact-checking is particularly challenging as it requires checking internet text written in everyday language against evidence from journal articles written in formal academic language. Check-COVID contains 1, 504 expert-annotated news claims about the coronavirus paired with sentence-level evidence from scientific journal articles and veracity labels. It includes both extracted (journalist-written) and composed (annotator-written) claims. Experiments using both a fact-checking specific system and GPT-3.5, which respectively achieve F1 scores of 76.99 and 69.90 on this task, reveal the difficulty of automatically fact-checking both claim types and the importance of in-domain data for good performance. Our data and models are released publicly at https://github.com/posuer/Check-COVID.

**Title:** Reconstructing the Mind's Eye: fMRI-to-Image with Contrastive Learning  and Diffusion Priors  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18274  
**Abstract:** We present MindEye, a novel fMRI-to-image approach to retrieve and reconstruct viewed images from brain activity. Our model comprises two parallel submodules that are specialized for retrieval (using contrastive learning) and reconstruction (using a diffusion prior). MindEye can map fMRI brain activity to any high dimensional multimodal latent space, like CLIP image space, enabling image reconstruction using generative models that accept embeddings from this latent space. We comprehensively compare our approach with other existing methods, using both qualitative side-by-side comparisons and quantitative evaluations, and show that MindEye achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and retrieval tasks. In particular, MindEye can retrieve the exact original image even among highly similar candidates indicating that its brain embeddings retain fine-grained image-specific information. This allows us to accurately retrieve images even from large-scale databases like LAION-5B. We demonstrate through ablations that MindEye's performance improvements over previous methods result from specialized submodules for retrieval and reconstruction, improved training techniques, and training models with orders of magnitude more parameters. Furthermore, we show that MindEye can better preserve low-level image features in the reconstructions by using img2img, with outputs from a separate autoencoder. All code is available on GitHub.

**Title:** HyperConformer: Multi-head HyperMixer for Efficient Speech Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18281  
**Abstract:** State-of-the-art ASR systems have achieved promising results by modeling local and global interactions separately. While the former can be computed efficiently, global interactions are usually modeled via attention mechanisms, which are expensive for long input sequences. Here, we address this by extending HyperMixer, an efficient alternative to attention exhibiting linear complexity, to the Conformer architecture for speech recognition, leading to HyperConformer. In particular, multi-head HyperConformer achieves comparable or higher recognition performance while being more efficient than Conformer in terms of inference speed, memory, parameter count, and available training data. HyperConformer achieves a word error rate of 2.9% on Librispeech test-clean with less than 8M neural parameters and a peak memory during training of 5.7GB, hence trainable with accessible hardware. Encoder speed is between 38% on mid-length speech and 56% on long speech faster than an equivalent Conformer. (The HyperConformer recipe is publicly available in: https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/LibriSpeech/ASR/transformer/)

**Title:** Photoswap: Personalized Subject Swapping in Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18286  
**Abstract:** In an era where images and visual content dominate our digital landscape, the ability to manipulate and personalize these images has become a necessity. Envision seamlessly substituting a tabby cat lounging on a sunlit window sill in a photograph with your own playful puppy, all while preserving the original charm and composition of the image. We present Photoswap, a novel approach that enables this immersive image editing experience through personalized subject swapping in existing images. Photoswap first learns the visual concept of the subject from reference images and then swaps it into the target image using pre-trained diffusion models in a training-free manner. We establish that a well-conceptualized visual subject can be seamlessly transferred to any image with appropriate self-attention and cross-attention manipulation, maintaining the pose of the swapped subject and the overall coherence of the image. Comprehensive experiments underscore the efficacy and controllability of Photoswap in personalized subject swapping. Furthermore, Photoswap significantly outperforms baseline methods in human ratings across subject swapping, background preservation, and overall quality, revealing its vast application potential, from entertainment to professional editing.

**Title:** Mix-of-Show: Decentralized Low-Rank Adaptation for Multi-Concept  Customization of Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18292  
**Abstract:** Public large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have gained significant attention from the community. These models can be easily customized for new concepts using low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). However, the utilization of multiple concept LoRAs to jointly support multiple customized concepts presents a challenge. We refer to this scenario as decentralized multi-concept customization, which involves single-client concept tuning and center-node concept fusion. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Mix-of-Show that addresses the challenges of decentralized multi-concept customization, including concept conflicts resulting from existing single-client LoRA tuning and identity loss during model fusion. Mix-of-Show adopts an embedding-decomposed LoRA (ED-LoRA) for single-client tuning and gradient fusion for the center node to preserve the in-domain essence of single concepts and support theoretically limitless concept fusion. Additionally, we introduce regionally controllable sampling, which extends spatially controllable sampling (e.g., ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor) to address attribute binding and missing object problems in multi-concept sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mix-of-Show is capable of composing multiple customized concepts with high fidelity, including characters, objects, and scenes.

**Title:** Transformer Language Models Handle Word Frequency in Prediction Head  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18294  
**Abstract:** Prediction head is a crucial component of Transformer language models. Despite its direct impact on prediction, this component has often been overlooked in analyzing Transformers. In this study, we investigate the inner workings of the prediction head, specifically focusing on bias parameters. Our experiments with BERT and GPT-2 models reveal that the biases in their word prediction heads play a significant role in the models' ability to reflect word frequency in a corpus, aligning with the logit adjustment method commonly used in long-tailed learning. We also quantify the effect of controlling the biases in practical auto-regressive text generation scenarios; under a particular setting, more diverse text can be generated without compromising text quality.

**Abstract:** Text-to-image generation has recently witnessed remarkable achievements. We introduce a text-conditional image diffusion model, termed RAPHAEL, to generate highly artistic images, which accurately portray the text prompts, encompassing multiple nouns, adjectives, and verbs. This is achieved by stacking tens of mixture-of-experts (MoEs) layers, i.e., space-MoE and time-MoE layers, enabling billions of diffusion paths (routes) from the network input to the output. Each path intuitively functions as a "painter" for depicting a particular textual concept onto a specified image region at a diffusion timestep. Comprehensive experiments reveal that RAPHAEL outperforms recent cutting-edge models, such as Stable Diffusion, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, DeepFloyd, and DALL-E 2, in terms of both image quality and aesthetic appeal. Firstly, RAPHAEL exhibits superior performance in switching images across diverse styles, such as Japanese comics, realism, cyberpunk, and ink illustration. Secondly, a single model with three billion parameters, trained on 1,000 A100 GPUs for two months, achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 6.61 on the COCO dataset. Furthermore, RAPHAEL significantly surpasses its counterparts in human evaluation on the ViLG-300 benchmark. We believe that RAPHAEL holds the potential to propel the frontiers of image generation research in both academia and industry, paving the way for future breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.

**Title:** Structured model selection via $\ell_1-\ell_2$ optimization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17467  
**Abstract:** Automated model selection is an important application in science and engineering. In this work, we develop a learning approach for identifying structured dynamical systems from undersampled and noisy spatiotemporal data. The learning is performed by a sparse least-squares fitting over a large set of candidate functions via a nonconvex $\ell_1-\ell_2$ sparse optimization solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers. Using a Bernstein-like inequality with a coherence condition, we show that if the set of candidate functions forms a structured random sampling matrix of a bounded orthogonal system, the recovery is stable and the error is bounded. The learning approach is validated on synthetic data generated by the viscous Burgers' equation and two reaction-diffusion equations. The computational results demonstrate the theoretical guarantees of success and the efficiency with respect to the ambient dimension and the number of candidate functions.

**Title:** Attention Mechanisms in Medical Image Segmentation: A Survey  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17937  
**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. Attention mechanisms that distinguish important parts from irrelevant parts have been widely used in medical image segmentation tasks. This paper systematically reviews the basic principles of attention mechanisms and their applications in medical image segmentation. First, we review the basic concepts of attention mechanism and formulation. Second, we surveyed over 300 articles related to medical image segmentation, and divided them into two groups based on their attention mechanisms, non-Transformer attention and Transformer attention. In each group, we deeply analyze the attention mechanisms from three aspects based on the current literature work, i.e., the principle of the mechanism (what to use), implementation methods (how to use), and application tasks (where to use). We also thoroughly analyzed the advantages and limitations of their applications to different tasks. Finally, we summarize the current state of research and shortcomings in the field, and discuss the potential challenges in the future, including task specificity, robustness, standard evaluation, etc. We hope that this review can showcase the overall research context of traditional and Transformer attention methods, provide a clear reference for subsequent research, and inspire more advanced attention research, not only in medical image segmentation, but also in other image analysis scenarios.

**Title:** ChatGPT-powered Conversational Drug Editing Using Retrieval and Domain  Feedback  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18090  
**Abstract:** Recent advancements in conversational large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable promise in various domains, including drug discovery. However, existing works mainly focus on investigating the capabilities of conversational LLMs on chemical reaction and retrosynthesis. While drug editing, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ChatDrug, a framework to facilitate the systematic investigation of drug editing using LLMs. ChatDrug jointly leverages a prompt module, a retrieval and domain feedback (ReDF) module, and a conversation module to streamline effective drug editing. We empirically show that ChatDrug reaches the best performance on 33 out of 39 drug editing tasks, encompassing small molecules, peptides, and proteins. We further demonstrate, through 10 case studies, that ChatDrug can successfully identify the key substructures (e.g., the molecule functional groups, peptide motifs, and protein structures) for manipulation, generating diverse and valid suggestions for drug editing. Promisingly, we also show that ChatDrug can offer insightful explanations from a domain-specific perspective, enhancing interpretability and enabling informed decision-making. This research sheds light on the potential of ChatGPT and conversational LLMs for drug editing. It paves the way for a more efficient and collaborative drug discovery pipeline, contributing to the advancement of pharmaceutical research and development.

**Title:** TCN AA: A Wi Fi based Temporal Convolution Network for Human to Human  Interaction Recognition with Augmentation and Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18211  
**Abstract:** The utilization of Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR) has gained considerable interest in recent times, primarily owing to its applications in various domains such as healthcare for monitoring breath and heart rate, security, elderly care, and others. These Wi-Fi-based methods exhibit several advantages over conventional state-of-the-art techniques that rely on cameras and sensors, including lower costs and ease of deployment. However, a significant challenge associated with Wi-Fi-based HAR is the significant decline in performance when the scene or subject changes. To mitigate this issue, it is imperative to train the model using an extensive dataset. In recent studies, the utilization of CNN-based models or sequence-to-sequence models such as LSTM, GRU, or Transformer has become prevalent. While sequence-to-sequence models can be more precise, they are also more computationally intensive and require a larger amount of training data. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a temporal convolution network with augmentations and attention, referred to as TCN-AA. Our proposed method is computationally efficient and exhibits improved accuracy even when the data size is increased threefold through our augmentation techniques. Our experiments on a publicly available dataset indicate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with a final accuracy of 99.42%.

**Title:** High-Fidelity Image Compression with Score-based Generative Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18231  
**Abstract:** Despite the tremendous success of diffusion generative models in text-to-image generation, replicating this success in the domain of image compression has proven difficult. In this paper, we demonstrate that diffusion can significantly improve perceptual quality at a given bit-rate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches PO-ELIC and HiFiC as measured by FID score. This is achieved using a simple but theoretically motivated two-stage approach combining an autoencoder targeting MSE followed by a further score-based decoder. However, as we will show, implementation details matter and the optimal design decisions can differ greatly from typical text-to-image models.

**Title:** Temporal Aware Mixed Attention-based Convolution and Transformer Network  (MACTN) for EEG Emotion Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18234  
**Abstract:** Emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, and electroencephalography (EEG) is advantageous for reflecting human emotional states. In this study, we propose MACTN, a hierarchical hybrid model for jointly modeling local and global temporal information. The model is inspired by neuroscience research on the temporal dynamics of emotions. MACTN extracts local emotional features through a convolutional neural network (CNN) and integrates sparse global emotional features through a transformer. Moreover, we employ channel attention mechanisms to identify the most task-relevant channels. Through extensive experimentation on two publicly available datasets, namely THU-EP and DEAP, our proposed method, MACTN, consistently achieves superior classification accuracy and F1 scores compared to other existing methods in most experimental settings. Furthermore, ablation studies have shown that the integration of both self-attention mechanisms and channel attention mechanisms leads to improved classification performance. Finally, an earlier version of this method, which shares the same ideas, won the Emotional BCI Competition's final championship in the 2022 World Robot Contest.
