**Title:** Towards the Vulnerability of Watermarking Artificial Intelligence  Generated Content  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07726  
**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is gaining great popularity in social media, with many commercial services available. These services leverage advanced generative models, such as latent diffusion models and large language models, to generate creative content (e.g., realistic images, fluent sentences) for users. The usage of such generated content needs to be highly regulated, as the service providers need to ensure the users do not violate the usage policies (e.g., abuse for commercialization, generating and distributing unsafe content).

**Title:** Domain-Controlled Prompt Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07730  
**Abstract:** Large pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown remarkable generalization capabilities across various tasks when appropriate text prompts are provided. However, adapting these models to specialized domains, like remote sensing images (RSIs), medical images, etc, remains unexplored and challenging. Existing prompt learning methods often lack domain-awareness or domain-transfer mechanisms, leading to suboptimal performance due to the misinterpretation of specialized images in natural image patterns. To tackle this dilemma, we proposed a Domain-Controlled Prompt Learning for the specialized domains. Specifically, the large-scale specialized domain foundation model (LSDM) is first introduced to provide essential specialized domain knowledge. Using lightweight neural networks, we transfer this knowledge into domain biases, which control both the visual and language branches to obtain domain-adaptive prompts in a directly incorporating manner. Simultaneously, to overcome the existing overfitting challenge, we propose a novel noisy-adding strategy, without extra trainable parameters, to help the model escape the suboptimal solution in a global domain oscillation manner. Experimental results show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in specialized domain image recognition datasets. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCPL-8588.

**Title:** DrivingDiffusion: Layout-Guided multi-view driving scene video  generation with latent diffusion model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07771  
**Abstract:** With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving based on the powerful and unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, a demand for high-quality and large-scale multi-view video data with accurate annotation is urgently required. However, such large-scale multi-view data is hard to obtain due to expensive collection and annotation costs. To alleviate the problem, we propose a spatial-temporal consistent diffusion framework DrivingDiffusion, to generate realistic multi-view videos controlled by 3D layout. There are three challenges when synthesizing multi-view videos given a 3D layout: How to keep 1) cross-view consistency and 2) cross-frame consistency? 3) How to guarantee the quality of the generated instances? Our DrivingDiffusion solves the problem by cascading the multi-view single-frame image generation step, the single-view video generation step shared by multiple cameras, and post-processing that can handle long video generation. In the multi-view model, the consistency of multi-view images is ensured by information exchange between adjacent cameras. In the temporal model, we mainly query the information that needs attention in subsequent frame generation from the multi-view images of the first frame. We also introduce the local prompt to effectively improve the quality of generated instances. In post-processing, we further enhance the cross-view consistency of subsequent frames and extend the video length by employing temporal sliding window algorithm. Without any extra cost, our model can generate large-scale realistic multi-camera driving videos in complex urban scenes, fueling the downstream driving tasks. The code will be made publicly available.

**Title:** 3D TransUNet: Advancing Medical Image Segmentation through Vision  Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07781  
**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in advancing healthcare systems for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. The u-shaped architecture, popularly known as U-Net, has proven highly successful for various medical image segmentation tasks. However, U-Net's convolution-based operations inherently limit its ability to model long-range dependencies effectively. To address these limitations, researchers have turned to Transformers, renowned for their global self-attention mechanisms, as alternative architectures. One popular network is our previous TransUNet, which leverages Transformers' self-attention to complement U-Net's localized information with the global context. In this paper, we extend the 2D TransUNet architecture to a 3D network by building upon the state-of-the-art nnU-Net architecture, and fully exploring Transformers' potential in both the encoder and decoder design. We introduce two key components: 1) A Transformer encoder that tokenizes image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) feature map, enabling the extraction of global contexts, and 2) A Transformer decoder that adaptively refines candidate regions by utilizing cross-attention between candidate proposals and U-Net features. Our investigations reveal that different medical tasks benefit from distinct architectural designs. The Transformer encoder excels in multi-organ segmentation, where the relationship among organs is crucial. On the other hand, the Transformer decoder proves more beneficial for dealing with small and challenging segmented targets such as tumor segmentation. Extensive experiments showcase the significant potential of integrating a Transformer-based encoder and decoder into the u-shaped medical image segmentation architecture. TransUNet outperforms competitors in various medical applications.

**Title:** Generative Modeling with Phase Stochastic Bridges  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07805  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) represent state-of-the-art generative models for continuous inputs. DMs work by constructing a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) in the input space (ie, position space), and using a neural network to reverse it. In this work, we introduce a novel generative modeling framework grounded in \textbf{phase space dynamics}, where a phase space is defined as {an augmented space encompassing both position and velocity.} Leveraging insights from Stochastic Optimal Control, we construct a path measure in the phase space that enables efficient sampling. {In contrast to DMs, our framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation.} This early prediction sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. On standard image generation benchmarks, our model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs). Furthermore, our approach rivals the performance of diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques, underscoring its potential as a new tool generative modeling.

**Title:** Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07820  
**Abstract:** By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.

**Title:** Does Synthetic Data Make Large Language Models More Efficient?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07830  
**Abstract:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone transformative changes with the advent of deep learning methodologies. One challenge persistently confronting researchers is the scarcity of high-quality, annotated datasets that drive these models. This paper explores the nuances of synthetic data generation in NLP, with a focal point on template-based question generation. By assessing its advantages, including data augmentation potential and the introduction of structured variety, we juxtapose these benefits against inherent limitations, such as the risk of overfitting and the constraints posed by pre-defined templates. Drawing from empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the impact of template-based synthetic data on the performance of modern transformer models. We conclude by emphasizing the delicate balance required between synthetic and real-world data, and the future trajectories of integrating synthetic data in model training pipelines. The findings aim to guide NLP practitioners in harnessing synthetic data's potential, ensuring optimal model performance in diverse applications.

**Title:** DiPPeR: Diffusion-based 2D Path Planner applied on Legged Robots  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07842  
**Abstract:** In this work, we present DiPPeR, a novel and fast 2D path planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion, leveraging diffusion-driven techniques. Our contributions include a scalable dataset of map images and corresponding end-to-end trajectories, an image-conditioned diffusion planner for mobile robots, and a training/inference pipeline employing CNNs. We validate our approach in several mazes, as well as in real-world deployment scenarios on Boston Dynamic's Spot and Unitree's Go1 robots. DiPPeR performs on average 70 times faster for trajectory generation against both search based and data driven path planning algorithms with an average of 80% consistency in producing feasible paths of various length in maps of variable size, and obstacle structure.

**Title:** Assessing Evaluation Metrics for Neural Test Oracle Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07856  
**Abstract:** In this work, we revisit existing oracle generation studies plus ChatGPT to empirically investigate the current standing of their performance in both NLG-based and test adequacy metrics. Specifically, we train and run four state-of-the-art test oracle generation models on five NLG-based and two test adequacy metrics for our analysis. We apply two different correlation analyses between these two different sets of metrics. Surprisingly, we found no significant correlation between the NLG-based metrics and test adequacy metrics. For instance, oracles generated from ChatGPT on the project activemq-artemis had the highest performance on all the NLG-based metrics among the studied NOGs, however, it had the most number of projects with a decrease in test adequacy metrics compared to all the studied NOGs. We further conduct a qualitative analysis to explore the reasons behind our observations, we found that oracles with high NLG-based metrics but low test adequacy metrics tend to have complex or multiple chained method invocations within the oracle's parameters, making it hard for the model to generate completely, affecting the test adequacy metrics. On the other hand, oracles with low NLG-based metrics but high test adequacy metrics tend to have to call different assertion types or a different method that functions similarly to the ones in the ground truth. Overall, this work complements prior studies on test oracle generation with an extensive performance evaluation with both NLG and test adequacy metrics and provides guidelines for better assessment of deep learning applications in software test generation in the future.

**Title:** LangNav: Language as a Perceptual Representation for Navigation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07889  
**Abstract:** We explore the use of language as a perceptual representation for vision-and-language navigation. Our approach uses off-the-shelf vision systems (for image captioning and object detection) to convert an agent's egocentric panoramic view at each time step into natural language descriptions. We then finetune a pretrained language model to select an action, based on the current view and the trajectory history, that would best fulfill the navigation instructions. In contrast to the standard setup which adapts a pretrained language model to work directly with continuous visual features from pretrained vision models, our approach instead uses (discrete) language as the perceptual representation. We explore two use cases of our language-based navigation (LangNav) approach on the R2R vision-and-language navigation benchmark: generating synthetic trajectories from a prompted large language model (GPT-4) with which to finetune a smaller language model; and sim-to-real transfer where we transfer a policy learned on a simulated environment (ALFRED) to a real-world environment (R2R). Our approach is found to improve upon strong baselines that rely on visual features in settings where only a few gold trajectories (10-100) are available, demonstrating the potential of using language as a perceptual representation for navigation tasks.

**Title:** Efficient Integrators for Diffusion Generative Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07894  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models suffer from slow sample generation at inference time. Therefore, developing a principled framework for fast deterministic/stochastic sampling for a broader class of diffusion models is a promising direction. We propose two complementary frameworks for accelerating sample generation in pre-trained models: Conjugate Integrators and Splitting Integrators. Conjugate integrators generalize DDIM, mapping the reverse diffusion dynamics to a more amenable space for sampling. In contrast, splitting-based integrators, commonly used in molecular dynamics, reduce the numerical simulation error by cleverly alternating between numerical updates involving the data and auxiliary variables. After extensively studying these methods empirically and theoretically, we present a hybrid method that leads to the best-reported performance for diffusion models in augmented spaces. Applied to Phase Space Langevin Diffusion [Pandey & Mandt, 2023] on CIFAR-10, our deterministic and stochastic samplers achieve FID scores of 2.11 and 2.36 in only 100 network function evaluations (NFE) as compared to 2.57 and 2.63 for the best-performing baselines, respectively. Our code and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/mandt-lab/PSLD}.

**Title:** NoMaD: Goal Masked Diffusion Policies for Navigation and Exploration  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07896  
**Abstract:** Robotic learning for navigation in unfamiliar environments needs to provide policies for both task-oriented navigation (i.e., reaching a goal that the robot has located), and task-agnostic exploration (i.e., searching for a goal in a novel setting). Typically, these roles are handled by separate models, for example by using subgoal proposals, planning, or separate navigation strategies. In this paper, we describe how we can train a single unified diffusion policy to handle both goal-directed navigation and goal-agnostic exploration, with the latter providing the ability to search novel environments, and the former providing the ability to reach a user-specified goal once it has been located. We show that this unified policy results in better overall performance when navigating to visually indicated goals in novel environments, as compared to approaches that use subgoal proposals from generative models, or prior methods based on latent variable models. We instantiate our method by using a large-scale Transformer-based policy trained on data from multiple ground robots, with a diffusion model decoder to flexibly handle both goal-conditioned and goal-agnostic navigation. Our experiments, conducted on a real-world mobile robot platform, show effective navigation in unseen environments in comparison with five alternative methods, and demonstrate significant improvements in performance and lower collision rates, despite utilizing smaller models than state-of-the-art approaches.

**Title:** Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural Radiance Field  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07916  
**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in modelling 3D scenes. Dynamic NeRFs extend this model by capturing time-varying elements, typically using deformation fields. The existing dynamic NeRFs employ a similar Eulerian representation for both light radiance and deformation fields. This leads to a close coupling of appearance and motion and lacks a physical interpretation. In this work, we propose Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural Radiance Field (DAP-NeRF), which introduces particle-based representation to model the motions of visual elements in a dynamic 3D scene. DAP-NeRF consists of superposition of a static field and a dynamic field. The dynamic field is quantised as a collection of {\em appearance particles}, which carries the visual information of a small dynamic element in the scene and is equipped with a motion model. All components, including the static field, the visual features and motion models of the particles, are learned from monocular videos without any prior geometric knowledge of the scene. We develop an efficient computational framework for the particle-based model. We also construct a new dataset to evaluate motion modelling. Experimental results show that DAP-NeRF is an effective technique to capture not only the appearance but also the physically meaningful motions in a 3D dynamic scene.

**Title:** The Expresssive Power of Transformers with Chain of Thought  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07923  
**Abstract:** Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice, transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps adds a clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps make them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad impacts its reasoning power.

**Title:** CleftGAN: Adapting A Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network To  Create Images Depicting Cleft Lip Deformity  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07969  
**Abstract:** A major obstacle when attempting to train a machine learning system to evaluate facial clefts is the scarcity of large datasets of high-quality, ethics board-approved patient images. In response, we have built a deep learning-based cleft lip generator designed to produce an almost unlimited number of artificial images exhibiting high-fidelity facsimiles of cleft lip with wide variation. We undertook a transfer learning protocol testing different versions of StyleGAN-ADA (a generative adversarial network image generator incorporating adaptive data augmentation (ADA)) as the base model. Training images depicting a variety of cleft deformities were pre-processed to adjust for rotation, scaling, color adjustment and background blurring. The ADA modification of the primary algorithm permitted construction of our new generative model while requiring input of a relatively small number of training images. Adversarial training was carried out using 514 unique frontal photographs of cleft-affected faces to adapt a pre-trained model based on 70,000 normal faces. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) was used to measure the similarity of the newly generated facial images to the cleft training dataset, while Perceptual Path Length (PPL) and the novel Divergence Index of Severity Histograms (DISH) measures were also used to assess the performance of the image generator that we dub CleftGAN. We found that StyleGAN3 with translation invariance (StyleGAN3-t) performed optimally as a base model. Generated images achieved a low FID reflecting a close similarity to our training input dataset of genuine cleft images. Low PPL and DISH measures reflected a smooth and semantically valid interpolation of images through the transfer learning process and a similar distribution of severity in the training and generated images, respectively.

**Title:** Interpretable Diffusion via Information Decomposition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07972  
**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion models enable conditional generation and density modeling of complex relationships like images and text. However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.

**Title:** Self-supervised visual learning for analyzing firearms trafficking  activities on the Web  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07975  
**Abstract:** Automated visual firearms classification from RGB images is an important real-world task with applications in public space security, intelligence gathering and law enforcement investigations. When applied to images massively crawled from the World Wide Web (including social media and dark Web sites), it can serve as an important component of systems that attempt to identify criminal firearms trafficking networks, by analyzing Big Data from open-source intelligence. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are the state-of-the-art methodology for achieving this, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) being typically employed. The common transfer learning approach consists of pretraining on a large-scale, generic annotated dataset for whole-image classification, such as ImageNet-1k, and then finetuning the DNN on a smaller, annotated, task-specific, downstream dataset for visual firearms classification. Neither Visual Transformer (ViT) neural architectures nor Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches have been so far evaluated on this critical task. SSL essentially consists of replacing the traditional supervised pretraining objective with an unsupervised pretext task that does not require ground-truth labels..

**Title:** LEMON: Lossless model expansion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07999  
**Abstract:** Scaling of deep neural networks, especially Transformers, is pivotal for their surging performance and has further led to the emergence of sophisticated reasoning capabilities in foundation models. Such scaling generally requires training large models from scratch with random initialization, failing to leverage the knowledge acquired by their smaller counterparts, which are already resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle this inefficiency, we present $\textbf{L}$ossl$\textbf{E}$ss $\textbf{MO}$del Expansio$\textbf{N}$ (LEMON), a recipe to initialize scaled models using the weights of their smaller but pre-trained counterparts. This is followed by model training with an optimized learning rate scheduler tailored explicitly for the scaled models, substantially reducing the training time compared to training from scratch. Notably, LEMON is versatile, ensuring compatibility with various network structures, including models like Vision Transformers and BERT. Our empirical results demonstrate that LEMON reduces computational costs by 56.7% for Vision Transformers and 33.2% for BERT when compared to training from scratch.

**Title:** Effects of Human Adversarial and Affable Samples on BERT  Generalizability  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08008  
**Abstract:** BERT-based models have had strong performance on leaderboards, yet have been demonstrably worse in real-world settings requiring generalization. Limited quantities of training data is considered a key impediment to achieving generalizability in machine learning. In this paper, we examine the impact of training \textit{data quality}, not quantity, on a model's generalizability. We consider two characteristics of training data: the portion of human-adversarial (h-adversarial), i.e., sample pairs with seemingly minor differences but different ground-truth labels, and human-affable (h-affable) training samples, i.e., sample pairs with minor differences but the same ground-truth label. We find that for a fixed size of training samples, as a rule of thumb, having 10-30\% h-adversarial instances improves the precision, and therefore F1, by up to 20 points in the tasks of text classification and relation extraction. Increasing h-adversarials beyond this range can result in performance plateaus or even degradation.In contrast, h-affables may not contribute to a model's generalizability and may even degrade generalization performance.

**Title:** Harnessing Large Language Models' Empathetic Response Generation  Capabilities for Online Mental Health Counselling Support  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08017  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various information-seeking and reasoning tasks. These computational systems drive state-of-the-art dialogue systems, such as ChatGPT and Bard. They also carry substantial promise in meeting the growing demands of mental health care, albeit relatively unexplored. As such, this study sought to examine LLMs' capability to generate empathetic responses in conversations that emulate those in a mental health counselling setting. We selected five LLMs: version 3.5 and version 4 of the Generative Pre-training (GPT), Vicuna FastChat-T5, Pathways Language Model (PaLM) version 2, and Falcon-7B-Instruct. Based on a simple instructional prompt, these models responded to utterances derived from the EmpatheticDialogues (ED) dataset. Using three empathy-related metrics, we compared their responses to those from traditional response generation dialogue systems, which were fine-tuned on the ED dataset, along with human-generated responses. Notably, we discovered that responses from the LLMs were remarkably more empathetic in most scenarios. We position our findings in light of catapulting advancements in creating empathetic conversational systems.

**Title:** Local Graph Clustering with Noisy Labels  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08031  
**Abstract:** The growing interest in machine learning problems over graphs with additional node information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that require the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort has been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing the entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end, we propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy for additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary labels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and 0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We investigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph clustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the performance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the original and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider recovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph with independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the label noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted graph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach proves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in the label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels can be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover, utilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to significantly better local clustering performance across several real-world datasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.

**Title:** Age Estimation Based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Multi-head  Attention Mechanisms  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08064  
**Abstract:** Age estimation technology is a part of facial recognition and has been applied to identity authentication. This technology achieves the development and application of a juvenile anti-addiction system by authenticating users in the game. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer algorithms are widely used in this application scenario. However, these two models cannot flexibly extract and model features of faces with irregular shapes, and they are ineffective in capturing key information. Furthermore, the above methods will contain a lot of background information while extracting features, which will interfere with the model. In consequence, it is easy to extract redundant information from images. In this paper, a new modeling idea is proposed to solve this problem, which can flexibly model irregular objects. The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to extract features from irregular face images effectively, and multi-head attention mechanisms are added to avoid redundant features and capture key region information in the image. This model can effectively improve the accuracy of age estimation and reduce the MAE error value to about 3.64, which is better than the effect of today's age estimation model, to improve the accuracy of face recognition and identity authentication.

**Title:** Training Generative Question-Answering on Synthetic Data Obtained from  an Instruct-tuned Mo  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08072  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a simple and cost-effective method for synthesizing data to train question-answering systems. For training, fine-tuning GPT models is a common practice in resource-rich languages like English, however, it becomes challenging for non-English languages due to the scarcity of sufficient question-answer (QA) pairs. Existing approaches use question and answer generators trained on human-authored QA pairs, which involves substantial human expenses. In contrast, we use an instruct-tuned model to generate QA pairs in a zero-shot or few-shot manner. We conduct experiments to compare various strategies for obtaining QA pairs from the instruct-tuned model. The results demonstrate that a model trained on our proposed synthetic data achieves comparable performance to a model trained on manually curated datasets, without incurring human costs.

**Title:** To token or not to token: A Comparative Study of Text Representations  for Cross-Lingual Transfer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08078  
**Abstract:** Choosing an appropriate tokenization scheme is often a bottleneck in low-resource cross-lingual transfer. To understand the downstream implications of text representation choices, we perform a comparative analysis on language models having diverse text representation modalities including 2 segmentation-based models (\texttt{BERT}, \texttt{mBERT}), 1 image-based model (\texttt{PIXEL}), and 1 character-level model (\texttt{CANINE}). First, we propose a scoring Language Quotient (LQ) metric capable of providing a weighted representation of both zero-shot and few-shot evaluation combined. Utilizing this metric, we perform experiments comprising 19 source languages and 133 target languages on three tasks (POS tagging, Dependency parsing, and NER). Our analysis reveals that image-based models excel in cross-lingual transfer when languages are closely related and share visually similar scripts. However, for tasks biased toward word meaning (POS, NER), segmentation-based models prove to be superior. Furthermore, in dependency parsing tasks where word relationships play a crucial role, models with their character-level focus, outperform others. Finally, we propose a recommendation scheme based on our findings to guide model selection according to task and language requirements.

**Title:** Consistent123: Improve Consistency for One Image to 3D Object Synthesis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08092  
**Abstract:** Large image diffusion models enable novel view synthesis with high quality and excellent zero-shot capability. However, such models based on image-to-image translation have no guarantee of view consistency, limiting the performance for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction and image-to-3D generation. To empower consistency, we propose Consistent123 to synthesize novel views simultaneously by incorporating additional cross-view attention layers and the shared self-attention mechanism. The proposed attention mechanism improves the interaction across all synthesized views, as well as the alignment between the condition view and novel views. In the sampling stage, such architecture supports simultaneously generating an arbitrary number of views while training at a fixed length. We also introduce a progressive classifier-free guidance strategy to achieve the trade-off between texture and geometry for synthesized object views. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that Consistent123 outperforms baselines in view consistency by a large margin. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant improvement of Consistent123 on varying downstream tasks, showing its great potential in the 3D generation field.

**Title:** Promptor: A Conversational and Autonomous Prompt Generation Agent for  Intelligent Text Entry Techniques  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08101  
**Abstract:** Text entry is an essential task in our day-to-day digital interactions. Numerous intelligent features have been developed to streamline this process, making text entry more effective, efficient, and fluid. These improvements include sentence prediction and user personalization. However, as deep learning-based language models become the norm for these advanced features, the necessity for data collection and model fine-tuning increases. These challenges can be mitigated by harnessing the in-context learning capability of large language models such as GPT-3.5. This unique feature allows the language model to acquire new skills through prompts, eliminating the need for data collection and fine-tuning. Consequently, large language models can learn various text prediction techniques. We initially showed that, for a sentence prediction task, merely prompting GPT-3.5 surpassed a GPT-2 backed system and is comparable with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, with the latter two methods requiring costly data collection, fine-tuning and post-processing. However, the task of prompting large language models to specialize in specific text prediction tasks can be challenging, particularly for designers without expertise in prompt engineering. To address this, we introduce Promptor, a conversational prompt generation agent designed to engage proactively with designers. Promptor can automatically generate complex prompts tailored to meet specific needs, thus offering a solution to this challenge. We conducted a user study involving 24 participants creating prompts for three intelligent text entry tasks, half of the participants used Promptor while the other half designed prompts themselves. The results show that Promptor-designed prompts result in a 35% increase in similarity and 22% in coherence over those by designers.

**Title:** QASiNa: Religious Domain Question Answering using Sirah Nabawiyah  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08102  
**Abstract:** Nowadays, Question Answering (QA) tasks receive significant research focus, particularly with the development of Large Language Model (LLM) such as Chat GPT [1]. LLM can be applied to various domains, but it contradicts the principles of information transmission when applied to the Islamic domain. In Islam we strictly regulates the sources of information and who can give interpretations or tafseer for that sources [2]. The approach used by LLM to generate answers based on its own interpretation is similar to the concept of tafseer, LLM is neither an Islamic expert nor a human which is not permitted in Islam. Indonesia is the country with the largest Islamic believer population in the world [3]. With the high influence of LLM, we need to make evaluation of LLM in religious domain. Currently, there is only few religious QA dataset available and none of them using Sirah Nabawiyah especially in Indonesian Language. In this paper, we propose the Question Answering Sirah Nabawiyah (QASiNa) dataset, a novel dataset compiled from Sirah Nabawiyah literatures in Indonesian language. We demonstrate our dataset by using mBERT [4], XLM-R [5], and IndoBERT [6] which fine-tuned with Indonesian translation of SQuAD v2.0 [7]. XLM-R model returned the best performance on QASiNa with EM of 61.20, F1-Score of 75.94, and Substring Match of 70.00. We compare XLM-R performance with Chat GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 [1]. Both Chat GPT version returned lower EM and F1-Score with higher Substring Match, the gap of EM and Substring Match get wider in GPT-4. The experiment indicate that Chat GPT tends to give excessive interpretations as evidenced by its higher Substring Match scores compared to EM and F1-Score, even after providing instruction and context. This concludes Chat GPT is unsuitable for question answering task in religious domain especially for Islamic religion.

**Title:** Generalized Logit Adjustment: Calibrating Fine-tuned Models by Removing  Label Bias in Foundation Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08106  
**Abstract:** Foundation models like CLIP allow zero-shot transfer on various tasks without additional training data. Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive than a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and ensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks. However, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in foundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these foundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the subsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we systematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that bias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data cannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification tasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for debiasing foundation models. As our work resolves a fundamental flaw in the pre-training, the proposed GLA demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of tasks: it achieves 1.5 pp accuracy gains on ImageNet, an large average improvement (1.4-4.6 pp) on 11 few-shot datasets, 2.4 pp gains on long-tailed classification.

**Title:** Can Large Language Models Really Improve by Self-critiquing Their Own  Plans?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08118  
**Abstract:** There have been widespread claims about Large Language Models (LLMs) being able to successfully verify or self-critique their candidate solutions in reasoning problems in an iterative mode. Intrigued by those claims, in this paper we set out to investigate the verification/self-critiquing abilities of large language models in the context of planning. We evaluate a planning system that employs LLMs for both plan generation and verification. We assess the verifier LLM's performance against ground-truth verification, the impact of self-critiquing on plan generation, and the influence of varying feedback levels on system performance. Using GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, for both generation and verification, our findings reveal that self-critiquing appears to diminish plan generation performance, especially when compared to systems with external, sound verifiers and the LLM verifiers in that system produce a notable number of false positives, compromising the system's reliability. Additionally, the nature of feedback, whether binary or detailed, showed minimal impact on plan generation. Collectively, our results cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs in a self-critiquing, iterative framework for planning tasks.

**Title:** Context Compression for Auto-regressive Transformers with Sentinel  Tokens  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08152  
**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity. At last, we comprehensively profile the benefit of context compression on improving the system throughout. Code is available at https://github.com/DRSY/KV_Compression.

**Title:** MCRepair: Multi-Chunk Program Repair via Patch Optimization with Buggy  Block  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08157  
**Abstract:** Automated program repair (APR) is a technology that identifies and repairs bugs automatically. However, repairing multi-chunk bugs remains a long-standing and challenging problem because an APR technique must consider dependencies and then reduce the large patch space. In addition, little is known about how to combine individual candidate patches even though multi-chunk bugs require combinations. Therefore, we propose a novel APR technique called multi-code repair (MCRepair), which applies a buggy block, patch optimization, and CodeBERT to target multi-chunk bugs. A buggy block is a novel method that binds buggy chunks into a multi-buggy chunk and preprocesses the chunk with its buggy contexts for patch space reduction and dependency problems. Patch optimization is a novel strategy that effectively combines the generated candidate patches with patch space reduction. In addition, CodeBERT, a BERT for source code datasets, is fine-tuned to address the lack of datasets and out-of-vocabulary problems. We conducted several experiments to evaluate our approach on six project modules of Defects4J. In the experiments using Defects4J, MCRepair repaired 65 bugs, including 21 multi-chunk bugs. Moreover, it fixed 18 unique bugs, including eight multi-chunk bugs, and improved 40 to 250 percent performance than the baselines.

**Title:** Ziya-VL: Bilingual Large Vision-Language Model via Multi-Task  Instruction Tuning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08166  
**Abstract:** Recent advancements enlarge the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot image-to-text generation and understanding by integrating multi-modal inputs. However, such success is typically limited to English scenarios due to the lack of large-scale and high-quality non-English multi-modal resources, making it extremely difficult to establish competitive counterparts in other languages. In this paper, we introduce the Ziya-VL series, a set of bilingual large-scale vision-language models (LVLMs) designed to incorporate visual semantics into LLM for multi-modal dialogue. Composed of Ziya-VL-Base and Ziya-VL-Chat, our models adopt the Querying Transformer from BLIP-2, further exploring the assistance of optimization schemes such as instruction tuning, multi-stage training and low-rank adaptation module for visual-language alignment. In addition, we stimulate the understanding ability of GPT-4 in multi-modal scenarios, translating our gathered English image-text datasets into Chinese and generating instruction-response through the in-context learning method. The experiment results demonstrate that compared to the existing LVLMs, Ziya-VL achieves competitive performance across a wide range of English-only tasks including zero-shot image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering. The evaluation leaderboard accessed by GPT-4 also indicates that our models possess satisfactory image-text understanding and generation capabilities in Chinese multi-modal scenario dialogues.

**Title:** Multiclass Classification of Policy Documents with Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08167  
**Abstract:** Classifying policy documents into policy issue topics has been a long-time effort in political science and communication disciplines. Efforts to automate text classification processes for social science research purposes have so far achieved remarkable results, but there is still a large room for progress. In this work, we test the prediction performance of an alternative strategy, which requires human involvement much less than full manual coding. We use the GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models of the OpenAI, which are pre-trained instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLM), to classify congressional bills and congressional hearings into Comparative Agendas Project's 21 major policy issue topics. We propose three use-case scenarios and estimate overall accuracies ranging from %58-83 depending on scenario and GPT model employed. The three scenarios aims at minimal, moderate, and major human interference, respectively. Overall, our results point towards the insufficiency of complete reliance on GPT with minimal human intervention, an increasing accuracy along with the human effort exerted, and a surprisingly high accuracy achieved in the most humanly demanding use-case. However, the superior use-case achieved the %83 accuracy on the %65 of the data in which the two models agreed, suggesting that a similar approach to ours can be relatively easily implemented and allow for mostly automated coding of a majority of a given dataset. This could free up resources allowing manual human coding of the remaining %35 of the data to achieve an overall higher level of accuracy while reducing costs significantly.

**Title:** EIPE-text: Evaluation-Guided Iterative Plan Extraction for Long-Form  Narrative Text Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08185  
**Abstract:** Plan-and-Write is a common hierarchical approach in long-form narrative text generation, which first creates a plan to guide the narrative writing. Following this approach, several studies rely on simply prompting large language models for planning, which often yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Evaluation-guided Iterative Plan Extraction for long-form narrative text generation (EIPE-text), which extracts plans from the corpus of narratives and utilizes the extracted plans to construct a better planner. EIPE-text has three stages: plan extraction, learning, and inference. In the plan extraction stage, it iteratively extracts and improves plans from the narrative corpus and constructs a plan corpus. We propose a question answer (QA) based evaluation mechanism to automatically evaluate the plans and generate detailed plan refinement instructions to guide the iterative improvement. In the learning stage, we build a better planner by fine-tuning with the plan corpus or in-context learning with examples in the plan corpus. Finally, we leverage a hierarchical approach to generate long-form narratives. We evaluate the effectiveness of EIPE-text in the domains of novels and storytelling. Both GPT-4-based evaluations and human evaluations demonstrate that our method can generate more coherent and relevant long-form narratives. Our code will be released in the future.

**Title:** Visual Question Generation in Bengali  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08187  
**Abstract:** The task of Visual Question Generation (VQG) is to generate human-like questions relevant to the given image. As VQG is an emerging research field, existing works tend to focus only on resource-rich language such as English due to the availability of datasets. In this paper, we propose the first Bengali Visual Question Generation task and develop a novel transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture that generates questions in Bengali when given an image. We propose multiple variants of models - (i) image-only: baseline model of generating questions from images without additional information, (ii) image-category and image-answer-category: guided VQG where we condition the model to generate questions based on the answer and the category of expected question. These models are trained and evaluated on the translated VQAv2.0 dataset. Our quantitative and qualitative results establish the first state of the art models for VQG task in Bengali and demonstrate that our models are capable of generating grammatically correct and relevant questions. Our quantitative results show that our image-cat model achieves a BLUE-1 score of 33.12 and BLEU-3 score of 7.56 which is the highest of the other two variants. We also perform a human evaluation to assess the quality of the generation tasks. Human evaluation suggests that image-cat model is capable of generating goal-driven and attribute-specific questions and also stays relevant to the corresponding image.

**Title:** Language Models are Universal Embedders  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08232  
**Abstract:** In the large language model (LLM) revolution, embedding is a key component of various systems. For example, it is used to retrieve knowledge or memories for LLMs, to build content moderation filters, etc. As such cases span from English to other natural or programming languages, from retrieval to classification and beyond, it is desirable to build a unified embedding model rather than dedicated ones for each scenario. In this work, we make an initial step towards this goal, demonstrating that multiple languages (both natural and programming) pre-trained transformer decoders can embed universally when finetuned on limited English data. We provide a comprehensive practice with thorough evaluations. On English MTEB, our models achieve competitive performance on different embedding tasks by minimal training data. On other benchmarks, such as multilingual classification and code search, our models (without any supervision) perform comparably to, or even surpass heavily supervised baselines and/or APIs. These results provide evidence of a promising path towards building powerful unified embedders that can be applied across tasks and languages.

**Title:** Distilling from Vision-Language Models for Improved OOD Generalization  in Vision Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08255  
**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are trained on large amounts of image-text pairs, resulting in remarkable generalization across several data distributions. The prohibitively expensive training and data collection/curation costs of these models make them valuable Intellectual Property (IP) for organizations. This motivates a vendor-client paradigm, where a vendor trains a large-scale VLM and grants only input-output access to clients on a pay-per-query basis in a black-box setting. The client aims to minimize inference cost by distilling the VLM to a student model using the limited available task-specific data, and further deploying this student model in the downstream application. While naive distillation largely improves the In-Domain (ID) accuracy of the student, it fails to transfer the superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of the VLM teacher using the limited available labeled images. To mitigate this, we propose Vision-Language to Vision-Align, Distill, Predict (VL2V-ADiP), which first aligns the vision and language modalities of the teacher model with the vision modality of a pre-trained student model, and further distills the aligned VLM embeddings to the student. This maximally retains the pre-trained features of the student, while also incorporating the rich representations of the VLM image encoder and the superior generalization of the text embeddings. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard Domain Generalization benchmarks in a black-box teacher setting, and also when weights of the VLM are accessible.

**Abstract:** Aiming to build foundation models for time-series forecasting and study their scaling behavior, we present here our work-in-progress on Lag-Llama, a general-purpose univariate probabilistic time-series forecasting model trained on a large collection of time-series data. The model shows good zero-shot prediction capabilities on unseen "out-of-distribution" time-series datasets, outperforming supervised baselines. We use smoothly broken power-laws to fit and predict model scaling behavior. The open source code is made available at https://github.com/kashif/pytorch-transformer-ts.

The challenge called "Knowledge Base Construction from Pretrained Language Models" at International Semantic Web Conference 2023 defines tasks focused on constructing knowledge base using language model. Our focus was on Track 1 of the challenge, where the parameters are constrained to a maximum of 1 billion, and the inclusion of entity descriptions within the prompt is prohibited.

**Title:** Defending Our Privacy With Backdoors  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08320  
**Abstract:** The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.

**Title:** Transport-Hub-Aware Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Graph Transformer for  Traffic Flow Prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08328  
**Abstract:** As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. Traffic flow data are spatial-temporal, which are not only correlated to spatial locations in road networks, but also vary with temporal time indices. Existing methods have solved the challenges in traffic flow prediction partly, focusing on modeling spatial-temporal dependencies effectively, while not all intrinsic properties of traffic flow data are utilized fully. Besides, there are very few attempts at incremental learning of spatial-temporal data mining, and few previous works can be easily transferred to the traffic flow prediction task. Motivated by the challenge of incremental learning methods for traffic flow prediction and the underutilization of intrinsic properties of road networks, we propose a Transport-Hub-aware Spatial-Temporal adaptive graph transFormer (H-STFormer) for traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first design a novel spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Three graph masking matrices are integrated into spatial self-attentions to highlight both short- and long-term dependences. Additionally, we employ a temporal self-attention module to detect dynamic temporal patterns in the traffic flow data. Finally, we design an extra spatial-temporal knowledge distillation module for incremental learning of traffic flow prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of H-STFormer in normal and incremental traffic flow prediction tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/Fantasy-Shaw/H-STFormer.

**Title:** Neural Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08337  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance on many generative tasks. Despite recent success, most diffusion models are restricted in that they only allow linear transformation of the data distribution. In contrast, broader family of transformations can potentially help train generative distributions more efficiently, simplifying the reverse process and closing the gap between the true negative log-likelihood and the variational approximation. In this paper, we present Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a generalization of conventional diffusion models that enables defining and learning time-dependent non-linear transformations of data. We show how to optimise NDMs using a variational bound in a simulation-free setting. Moreover, we derive a time-continuous formulation of NDMs, which allows fast and reliable inference using off-the-shelf numerical ODE and SDE solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of NDMs with learnable transformations through experiments on standard image generation benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, downsampled versions of ImageNet and CelebA-HQ. NDMs outperform conventional diffusion models in terms of likelihood and produce high-quality samples.

**Title:** ALPHA: Attention-based Long-horizon Pathfinding in Highly-structured  Areas  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08350  
**Abstract:** The multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem seeks collision-free paths for a team of agents from their current positions to their pre-set goals in a known environment, and is an essential problem found at the core of many logistics, transportation, and general robotics applications. Existing learning-based MAPF approaches typically only let each agent make decisions based on a limited field-of-view (FOV) around its position, as a natural means to fix the input dimensions of its policy network. However, this often makes policies short-sighted, since agents lack the ability to perceive and plan for obstacles/agents beyond their FOV. To address this challenge, we propose ALPHA, a new framework combining the use of ground truth proximal (local) information and fuzzy distal (global) information to let agents sequence local decisions based on the full current state of the system, and avoid such myopicity. We further allow agents to make short-term predictions about each others' paths, as a means to reason about each others' path intentions, thereby enhancing the level of cooperation among agents at the whole system level. Our neural structure relies on a Graph Transformer architecture to allow agents to selectively combine these different sources of information and reason about their inter-dependencies at different spatial scales. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that ALPHA outperforms both globally-guided MAPF solvers and communication-learning based ones, showcasing its potential towards scalability in realistic deployments.

**Title:** A new local and explicit kinetic method for linear and non-linear  convection-diffusion problems with finite kinetic speeds: I. One-dimensional  case  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08356  
**Abstract:** We propose a numerical approach, of the BGK kinetic type, that is able to approximate with a given, but arbitrary, order of accuracy the solution of linear and non-linear convection-diffusion type problems: scalar advection-diffusion, non-linear scalar problems of this type and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Our kinetic model can use \emph{finite} advection speeds that are independent of the relaxation parameter, and the time step does not suffer from a parabolic constraint. Having finite speeds is in contrast with many of the previous works about this kind of approach, and we explain why this is possible: paraphrasing more or less \cite{golse:hal-00859451}, the convection-diffusion like PDE is not a limit of the BGK equation, but a correction of the same PDE without the parabolic term at the second order in the relaxation parameter that is interpreted as Knudsen number. We then show that introducing a matrix collision instead of the well-known BGK relaxation makes it possible to target a desired convection-diffusion system.

**Title:** Mapping Memes to Words for Multimodal Hateful Meme Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08368  
**Abstract:** Multimodal image-text memes are prevalent on the internet, serving as a unique form of communication that combines visual and textual elements to convey humor, ideas, or emotions. However, some memes take a malicious turn, promoting hateful content and perpetuating discrimination. Detecting hateful memes within this multimodal context is a challenging task that requires understanding the intertwined meaning of text and images. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel approach named ISSUES for multimodal hateful meme classification. ISSUES leverages a pre-trained CLIP vision-language model and the textual inversion technique to effectively capture the multimodal semantic content of the memes. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Hateful Memes Challenge and HarMeme datasets. The code and the pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/ISSUES.

**Title:** Worst-Case Morphs using Wasserstein ALI and Improved MIPGAN  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08371  
**Abstract:** A lot of progress has been made in the last years on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to create realistic images. However, to be able reconstruct images or to generate images using real data as input, an Encoder is needed that reverses the mapping from the GAN's latent space to image space. This means that three networks are needed: an Encoder, a Decoder (called Generator in a normal GAN) and a Discriminator. These three networks can be trained from scratch simultaneously (Adversarially Learned Inference), or alternatively an Encoder network can be trained that maps images into the latent space of a \textit{pretrained} GAN model (Inverse GAN). In the latter case, the networks are trained consecutively, so the Encoder has to make do with whatever model the Decoder learned during GAN training. Training three networks simultaneously is more unstable and therefore more challenging, but it is possible that the Encoder and Decoder benefit from interacting with each other during training. We compare the two different approaches and discuss whether it is worth the extra effort to train all three networks simultaneously.

**Title:** Jailbreaking Black Box Large Language Models in Twenty Queries  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08419  
**Abstract:** There is growing interest in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values. However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is therefore instrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse. To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM without human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queries the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIR often requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms. PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and PaLM-2.

**Title:** Revisiting Data Augmentation for Rotational Invariance in Convolutional  Neural Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08429  
**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) offer state of the art performance in various computer vision tasks. Many of those tasks require different subtypes of affine invariances (scale, rotational, translational) to image transformations. Convolutional layers are translation equivariant by design, but in their basic form lack invariances. In this work we investigate how best to include rotational invariance in a CNN for image classification. Our experiments show that networks trained with data augmentation alone can classify rotated images nearly as well as in the normal unrotated case; this increase in representational power comes only at the cost of training time. We also compare data augmentation versus two modified CNN models for achieving rotational invariance or equivariance, Spatial Transformer Networks and Group Equivariant CNNs, finding no significant accuracy increase with these specialized methods. In the case of data augmented networks, we also analyze which layers help the network to encode the rotational invariance, which is important for understanding its limitations and how to best retrain a network with data augmentation to achieve invariance to rotation.

**Title:** Debias the Training of Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08442  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models have demonstrated compelling generation quality by optimizing the variational lower bound through a simple denoising score matching loss. In this paper, we provide theoretical evidence that the prevailing practice of using a constant loss weight strategy in diffusion models leads to biased estimation during the training phase. Simply optimizing the denoising network to predict Gaussian noise with constant weighting may hinder precise estimations of original images. To address the issue, we propose an elegant and effective weighting strategy grounded in the theoretically unbiased principle. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic exploration to dissect the inherent bias problem deriving from constant weighting loss from the perspectives of its existence, impact and reasons. These analyses are expected to advance our understanding and demystify the inner workings of diffusion models. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed debiased estimation method significantly enhances sample quality without the reliance on complex techniques, and exhibits improved efficiency compared to the baseline method both in training and sampling processes.

**Title:** MotionDirector: Motion Customization of Text-to-Video Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08465  
**Abstract:** Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generations. Given a set of video clips of the same motion concept, the task of Motion Customization is to adapt existing text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos with this motion. For example, generating a video with a car moving in a prescribed manner under specific camera movements to make a movie, or a video illustrating how a bear would lift weights to inspire creators. Adaptation methods have been developed for customizing appearance like subject or style, yet unexplored for motion. It is straightforward to extend mainstream adaption methods for motion customization, including full model tuning, parameter-efficient tuning of additional layers, and Low-Rank Adaptions (LoRAs). However, the motion concept learned by these methods is often coupled with the limited appearances in the training videos, making it difficult to generalize the customized motion to other appearances. To overcome this challenge, we propose MotionDirector, with a dual-path LoRAs architecture to decouple the learning of appearance and motion. Further, we design a novel appearance-debiased temporal loss to mitigate the influence of appearance on the temporal training objective. Experimental results show the proposed method can generate videos of diverse appearances for the customized motions. Our method also supports various downstream applications, such as the mixing of different videos with their appearance and motion respectively, and animating a single image with customized motions. Our code and model weights will be released.

**Title:** Prometheus: Inducing Fine-grained Evaluation Capability in Language  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08491  
**Abstract:** Recently, using a powerful proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., GPT-4) as an evaluator for long-form responses has become the de facto standard. However, for practitioners with large-scale evaluation tasks and custom criteria in consideration (e.g., child-readability), using proprietary LLMs as an evaluator is unreliable due to the closed-source nature, uncontrolled versioning, and prohibitive costs. In this work, we propose Prometheus, a fully open-source LLM that is on par with GPT-4's evaluation capabilities when the appropriate reference materials (reference answer, score rubric) are accompanied. We first construct the Feedback Collection, a new dataset that consists of 1K fine-grained score rubrics, 20K instructions, and 100K responses and language feedback generated by GPT-4. Using the Feedback Collection, we train Prometheus, a 13B evaluator LLM that can assess any given long-form text based on customized score rubric provided by the user. Experimental results show that Prometheus scores a Pearson correlation of 0.897 with human evaluators when evaluating with 45 customized score rubrics, which is on par with GPT-4 (0.882), and greatly outperforms ChatGPT (0.392). Furthermore, measuring correlation with GPT-4 with 1222 customized score rubrics across four benchmarks (MT Bench, Vicuna Bench, Feedback Bench, Flask Eval) shows similar trends, bolstering Prometheus's capability as an evaluator LLM. Lastly, Prometheus achieves the highest accuracy on two human preference benchmarks (HHH Alignment & MT Bench Human Judgment) compared to open-sourced reward models explicitly trained on human preference datasets, highlighting its potential as an universal reward model.

**Title:** The Uncertainty-based Retrieval Framework for Ancient Chinese CWS and  POS  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08496  
**Abstract:** Automatic analysis for modern Chinese has greatly improved the accuracy of text mining in related fields, but the study of ancient Chinese is still relatively rare. Ancient text division and lexical annotation are important parts of classical literature comprehension, and previous studies have tried to construct auxiliary dictionary and other fused knowledge to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose a framework for ancient Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging that makes a twofold effort: on the one hand, we try to capture the wordhood semantics; on the other hand, we re-predict the uncertain samples of baseline model by introducing external knowledge. The performance of our architecture outperforms pre-trained BERT with CRF and existing tools such as Jiayan.

**Title:** Impact of time and note duration tokenizations on deep learning symbolic  music modeling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08497  
**Abstract:** Symbolic music is widely used in various deep learning tasks, including generation, transcription, synthesis, and Music Information Retrieval (MIR). It is mostly employed with discrete models like Transformers, which require music to be tokenized, i.e., formatted into sequences of distinct elements called tokens. Tokenization can be performed in different ways. As Transformer can struggle at reasoning, but capture more easily explicit information, it is important to study how the way the information is represented for such model impact their performances. In this work, we analyze the common tokenization methods and experiment with time and note duration representations. We compare the performances of these two impactful criteria on several tasks, including composer and emotion classification, music generation, and sequence representation learning. We demonstrate that explicit information leads to better results depending on the task.

**Title:** HoneyBee: Progressive Instruction Finetuning of Large Language Models  for Materials Science  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08511  
**Abstract:** We propose an instruction-based process for trustworthy data curation in materials science (MatSci-Instruct), which we then apply to finetune a LLaMa-based language model targeted for materials science (HoneyBee). MatSci-Instruct helps alleviate the scarcity of relevant, high-quality materials science textual data available in the open literature, and HoneyBee is the first billion-parameter language model specialized to materials science. In MatSci-Instruct we improve the trustworthiness of generated data by prompting multiple commercially available large language models for generation with an Instructor module (e.g. Chat-GPT) and verification from an independent Verifier module (e.g. Claude). Using MatSci-Instruct, we construct a dataset of multiple tasks and measure the quality of our dataset along multiple dimensions, including accuracy against known facts, relevance to materials science, as well as completeness and reasonableness of the data. Moreover, we iteratively generate more targeted instructions and instruction-data in a finetuning-evaluation-feedback loop leading to progressively better performance for our finetuned HoneyBee models. Our evaluation on the MatSci-NLP benchmark shows HoneyBee's outperformance of existing language models on materials science tasks and iterative improvement in successive stages of instruction-data refinement. We study the quality of HoneyBee's language modeling through automatic evaluation and analyze case studies to further understand the model's capabilities and limitations. Our code and relevant datasets are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/BangLab-UdeM-Mila/NLP4MatSci-HoneyBee}.

**Title:** LLM-augmented Preference Learning from Natural Language  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08523  
**Abstract:** Finding preferences expressed in natural language is an important but challenging task. State-of-the-art(SotA) methods leverage transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, etc. and graph neural architectures such as graph attention networks. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) are equipped to deal with larger context lengths and have much larger model sizes than the transformer-based model, we investigate their ability to classify comparative text directly. This work aims to serve as a first step towards using LLMs for the CPC task. We design and conduct a set of experiments that format the classification task into an input prompt for the LLM and a methodology to get a fixed-format response that can be automatically evaluated. Comparing performances with existing methods, we see that pre-trained LLMs are able to outperform the previous SotA models with no fine-tuning involved. Our results show that the LLMs can consistently outperform the SotA when the target text is large -- i.e. composed of multiple sentences --, and are still comparable to the SotA performance in shorter text. We also find that few-shot learning yields better performance than zero-shot learning.

**Title:** GaussianDreamer: Fast Generation from Text to 3D Gaussian Splatting with  Point Cloud Priors  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08529  
**Abstract:** In recent times, the generation of 3D assets from text prompts has shown impressive results. Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency, but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation, but the 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D generation framework, named as \name, is proposed, where the 3D diffusion model provides point cloud priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians. Our \name can generate a high-quality 3D instance within 25 minutes on one GPU, much faster than previous methods, while the generated instances can be directly rendered in real time.

**Title:** Idea2Img: Iterative Self-Refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for Automatic  Image Design and Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08541  
**Abstract:** We introduce ``Idea to Image,'' a system that enables multimodal iterative self-refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for automatic image design and generation. Humans can quickly identify the characteristics of different text-to-image (T2I) models via iterative explorations. This enables them to efficiently convert their high-level generation ideas into effective T2I prompts that can produce good images. We investigate if systems based on large multimodal models (LMMs) can develop analogous multimodal self-refinement abilities that enable exploring unknown models or environments via self-refining tries. Idea2Img cyclically generates revised T2I prompts to synthesize draft images, and provides directional feedback for prompt revision, both conditioned on its memory of the probed T2I model's characteristics. The iterative self-refinement brings Idea2Img various advantages over vanilla T2I models. Notably, Idea2Img can process input ideas with interleaved image-text sequences, follow ideas with design instructions, and generate images of better semantic and visual qualities. The user preference study validates the efficacy of multimodal iterative self-refinement on automatic image design and generation.

**Title:** NetDiffusion: Network Data Augmentation Through Protocol-Constrained  Traffic Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08543  
**Abstract:** Datasets of labeled network traces are essential for a multitude of machine learning (ML) tasks in networking, yet their availability is hindered by privacy and maintenance concerns, such as data staleness. To overcome this limitation, synthetic network traces can often augment existing datasets. Unfortunately, current synthetic trace generation methods, which typically produce only aggregated flow statistics or a few selected packet attributes, do not always suffice, especially when model training relies on having features that are only available from packet traces. This shortfall manifests in both insufficient statistical resemblance to real traces and suboptimal performance on ML tasks when employed for data augmentation. In this paper, we apply diffusion models to generate high-resolution synthetic network traffic traces. We present NetDiffusion, a tool that uses a finely-tuned, controlled variant of a Stable Diffusion model to generate synthetic network traffic that is high fidelity and conforms to protocol specifications. Our evaluation demonstrates that packet captures generated from NetDiffusion can achieve higher statistical similarity to real data and improved ML model performance than current state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., GAN-based approaches). Furthermore, our synthetic traces are compatible with common network analysis tools and support a myriad of network tasks, suggesting that NetDiffusion can serve a broader spectrum of network analysis and testing tasks, extending beyond ML-centric applications.

**Title:** Cross-Episodic Curriculum for Transformer Agents  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08549  
**Abstract:** We present a new algorithm, Cross-Episodic Curriculum (CEC), to boost the learning efficiency and generalization of Transformer agents. Central to CEC is the placement of cross-episodic experiences into a Transformer's context, which forms the basis of a curriculum. By sequentially structuring online learning trials and mixed-quality demonstrations, CEC constructs curricula that encapsulate learning progression and proficiency increase across episodes. Such synergy combined with the potent pattern recognition capabilities of Transformer models delivers a powerful cross-episodic attention mechanism. The effectiveness of CEC is demonstrated under two representative scenarios: one involving multi-task reinforcement learning with discrete control, such as in DeepMind Lab, where the curriculum captures the learning progression in both individual and progressively complex settings; and the other involving imitation learning with mixed-quality data for continuous control, as seen in RoboMimic, where the curriculum captures the improvement in demonstrators' expertise. In all instances, policies resulting from CEC exhibit superior performance and strong generalization. Code is open-sourced at https://cec-agent.github.io/ to facilitate research on Transformer agent learning.

**Title:** MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08560  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at https://memgpt.ai.

**Title:** Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement  Learning via Supervised Pretraining  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08566  
**Abstract:** Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently proposed training methods -- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from offline trajectories.

**Title:** Visual Data-Type Understanding does not emerge from Scaling  Vision-Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08577  
**Abstract:** Recent advances in the development of vision-language models (VLMs) are yielding remarkable success in recognizing visual semantic content, including impressive instances of compositional image understanding. Here, we introduce the novel task of \textit{Visual Data-Type Identification}, a basic perceptual skill with implications for data curation (e.g., noisy data-removal from large datasets, domain-specific retrieval) and autonomous vision (e.g., distinguishing changing weather conditions from camera lens staining). We develop two datasets consisting of animal images altered across a diverse set of 27 visual \textit{data-types}, spanning four broad categories. An extensive zero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs, ranging from 100M to 80B parameters, shows a nuanced performance landscape. While VLMs are reasonably good at identifying certain stylistic \textit{data-types}, such as cartoons and sketches, they struggle with simpler \textit{data-types} arising from basic manipulations like image rotations or additive noise. Our findings reveal that (i) model scaling alone yields marginal gains for contrastively-trained models like CLIP, and (ii) there is a pronounced drop in performance for the largest auto-regressively trained VLMs like OpenFlamingo. This finding points to a blind spot in current frontier VLMs: they excel in recognizing semantic content but fail to acquire an understanding of visual \textit{data-types} through scaling. By analyzing the pre-training distributions of these models and incorporating \textit{data-type} information into the captions during fine-tuning, we achieve a significant enhancement in performance. By exploring this previously uncharted task, we aim to set the stage for further advancing VLMs to equip them with visual data-type understanding. Code and datasets are released \href{https://github.com/bethgelab/DataTypeIdentification}{here}.

**Title:** HyperHuman: Hyper-Realistic Human Generation with Latent Structural  Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08579  
**Abstract:** Despite significant advances in large-scale text-to-image models, achieving hyper-realistic human image generation remains a desirable yet unsolved task. Existing models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 tend to generate human images with incoherent parts or unnatural poses. To tackle these challenges, our key insight is that human image is inherently structural over multiple granularities, from the coarse-level body skeleton to fine-grained spatial geometry. Therefore, capturing such correlations between the explicit appearance and latent structure in one model is essential to generate coherent and natural human images. To this end, we propose a unified framework, HyperHuman, that generates in-the-wild human images of high realism and diverse layouts. Specifically, 1) we first build a large-scale human-centric dataset, named HumanVerse, which consists of 340M images with comprehensive annotations like human pose, depth, and surface normal. 2) Next, we propose a Latent Structural Diffusion Model that simultaneously denoises the depth and surface normal along with the synthesized RGB image. Our model enforces the joint learning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and geometry in a unified network, where each branch in the model complements to each other with both structural awareness and textural richness. 3) Finally, to further boost the visual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to compose the predicted conditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework yields the state-of-the-art performance, generating hyper-realistic human images under diverse scenarios.

**Title:** OmniControl: Control Any Joint at Any Time for Human Motion Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08580  
**Abstract:** We present a novel approach named OmniControl for incorporating flexible spatial control signals into a text-conditioned human motion generation model based on the diffusion process. Unlike previous methods that can only control the pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial control signals over different joints at different times with only one model. Specifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated motion can tightly conform to the input control signals. At the same time, realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more coherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they are highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism. By combining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, and consistent with the spatial constraints. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising results when incorporating the constraints over other joints.

**Title:** Octopus: Embodied Vision-Language Programmer from Environmental Feedback  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08588  
**Abstract:** Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved substantial progress in multimodal perception and reasoning. Furthermore, when seamlessly integrated into an embodied agent, it signifies a crucial stride towards the creation of autonomous and context-aware systems capable of formulating plans and executing commands with precision. In this paper, we introduce Octopus, a novel VLM designed to proficiently decipher an agent's vision and textual task objectives and to formulate intricate action sequences and generate executable code. Our design allows the agent to adeptly handle a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games. Octopus is trained by leveraging GPT-4 to control an explorative agent to generate training data, i.e., action blueprints and the corresponding executable code, within our experimental environment called OctoVerse. We also collect the feedback that allows the enhanced training scheme of Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we illuminate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, and the proposed RLEF turns out to refine the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our model architecture, simulator, and dataset, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.

**Title:** Unsupervised Structured Noise Removal with Variational Lossy Autoencoder  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07887  
**Abstract:** Most unsupervised denoising methods are based on the assumption that imaging noise is either pixel-independent, i.e., spatially uncorrelated, or signal-independent, i.e., purely additive. However, in practice many imaging setups, especially in microscopy, suffer from a combination of signal-dependent noise (e.g. Poisson shot noise) and axis-aligned correlated noise (e.g. stripe shaped scanning or readout artifacts). In this paper, we present the first unsupervised deep learning-based denoiser that can remove this type of noise without access to any clean images or a noise model. Unlike self-supervised techniques, our method does not rely on removing pixels by masking or subsampling so can utilize all available information. We implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a specially designed autoregressive decoder capable of modelling the noise component of an image but incapable of independently modelling the underlying clean signal component. As a consequence, our VAE's encoder learns to encode only underlying clean signal content and to discard imaging noise. We also propose an additional decoder for mapping the encoder's latent variables back into image space, thereby sampling denoised images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methods for self- and unsupervised image denoising while being robust with respect to the size of the autoregressive receptive field.

**Title:** MLP-AMDC: An MLP Architecture for Adaptive-Mask-based Dual-Camera  snapshot hyperspectral imaging  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08002  
**Abstract:** Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) system has great advantages over traditional methods in dynamically acquiring Hyper-Spectral Image (HSI), but there are the following problems. 1) Traditional mask relies on random patterns or analytical design, both of which limit the performance improvement of CASSI. 2) Existing high-quality reconstruction algorithms are slow in reconstruction and can only reconstruct scene information offline. To address the above two problems, this paper designs the AMDC-CASSI system, introducing RGB camera with CASSI based on Adaptive-Mask as multimodal input to improve the reconstruction quality. The existing SOTA reconstruction schemes are based on transformer, but the operation of self-attention pulls down the operation efficiency of the network. In order to improve the inference speed of the reconstruction network, this paper proposes An MLP Architecture for Adaptive-Mask-based Dual-Camera (MLP-AMDC) to replace the transformer structure of the network. Numerous experiments have shown that MLP performs no less well than transformer-based structures for HSI reconstruction, while MLP greatly improves the network inference speed and has less number of parameters and operations, our method has a 8 db improvement over SOTA and at least a 5-fold improvement in reconstruction speed.

**Title:** ETDock: A Novel Equivariant Transformer for Protein-Ligand Docking  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08061  
**Abstract:** Predicting the docking between proteins and ligands is a crucial and challenging task for drug discovery. However, traditional docking methods mainly rely on scoring functions, and deep learning-based docking approaches usually neglect the 3D spatial information of proteins and ligands, as well as the graph-level features of ligands, which limits their performance. To address these limitations, we propose an equivariant transformer neural network for protein-ligand docking pose prediction. Our approach involves the fusion of ligand graph-level features by feature processing, followed by the learning of ligand and protein representations using our proposed TAMformer module. Additionally, we employ an iterative optimization approach based on the predicted distance matrix to generate refined ligand poses. The experimental results on real datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

**Title:** COVID-19 Detection Using Swin Transformer Approach from Computed  Tomography Images  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08165  
**Abstract:** The accurate and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 is of paramount importance, particularly in the context of large-scale medical imaging datasets. In this preprint paper, we propose a novel approach for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT images that leverages the power of Swin Transformer models, state-of-the-art solutions in computer vision tasks. Our method includes a systematic approach for patient-level predictions, where individual CT slices are classified as COVID-19 or non-COVID, and the patient's overall diagnosis is determined through majority voting. The application of the Swin Transformer in this context results in patient-level predictions that demonstrate exceptional diagnostic accuracy. In terms of evaluation metrics, our approach consistently outperforms the baseline, as well as numerous competing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in COVID-19 diagnosis. The macro F1 score achieved by our model exceeds the baseline and offers a robust solution for accurate diagnosis.
