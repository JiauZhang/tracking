**Title:** An Empirical Study of AI Generated Text Detection Tools  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01423  
**Abstract:** Since ChatGPT has emerged as a major AIGC model, providing high-quality responses across a wide range of applications (including software development and maintenance), it has attracted much interest from many individuals. ChatGPT has great promise, but there are serious problems that might arise from its misuse, especially in the realms of education and public safety. Several AIGC detectors are available, and they have all been tested on genuine text. However, more study is needed to see how effective they are for multi-domain ChatGPT material. This study aims to fill this need by creating a multi-domain dataset for testing the state-of-the-art APIs and tools for detecting artificially generated information used by universities and other research institutions. A large dataset consisting of articles, abstracts, stories, news, and product reviews was created for this study. The second step is to use the newly created dataset to put six tools through their paces. Six different artificial intelligence (AI) text identification systems, including "GPTkit," "GPTZero," "Originality," "Sapling," "Writer," and "Zylalab," have accuracy rates between 55.29 and 97.0%. Although all the tools fared well in the evaluations, originality was particularly effective across the board.

**Title:** Split and Merge: Aligning Position Biases in Large Language Model based  Evaluators  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01432  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as automated evaluators for assessing the quality of answers generated by AI systems. However, these LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to evaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping cost-efficiency. This represents a valuable step toward a more reliable and scalable use of LLMs for automated evaluations across diverse applications.

**Title:** Revolutionizing Mobile Interaction: Enabling a 3 Billion Parameter GPT  LLM on Mobile  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01434  
**Abstract:** The field of Artificial Intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, especially with the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture.

The article showcases a fine-tuned GPT LLM with 3 billion parameters that can operate smoothly on devices with as low as 4GB of memory. Through the integration of native code and model quantization techniques, the application not only serves as a general-purpose assistant but also facilitates seamless mobile interactions with text-to-actions features. The article provides insights into the training pipeline, implementation details, test results, and future directions of on-device LLM inference. This breakthrough technology opens up possibilities for empowering users with sophisticated AI capabilities while preserving their privacy and eliminating latency concerns.

**Title:** Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01436  
**Abstract:** Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in automatically designing graph neural networks. However, GNAS still requires intensive human labor with rich domain knowledge to design the search space and search strategy. In this paper, we integrate GPT-4 into GNAS and propose a new GPT-4 based Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GPT4GNAS for short). The basic idea of our method is to design a new class of prompts for GPT-4 to guide GPT-4 toward the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running GPT-4 with the prompts, GPT4GNAS generates more accurate graph neural networks with fast convergence. Experimental results show that embedding GPT-4 into GNAS outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods.

**Title:** UPAR: A Kantian-Inspired Prompting Framework for Enhancing Large  Language Model Capabilities  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01441  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive inferential capabilities, with numerous research endeavors devoted to enhancing this capacity through prompting. Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated into four phases: "Understand", "Plan", "Act", and "Reflect", enabling the extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference, producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory. Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these methods. With GPT-4, our approach elevates the accuracy from COT baseline of 22.92% to 58.33% in a challenging subset of GSM8K, and from 67.91% to 75.40% in the causal judgment task.

**Title:** The Entity-Deduction Arena: A playground for probing the conversational  reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01468  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are currently effective at answering questions that are clearly asked. However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can act unpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for the development of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions to resolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complex understanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multiple conversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging. In this paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability to deduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking the judge a series of queries. This \textit{entity-deducing game} can serve as an evaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planning capabilities of language models. We systematically evaluate various LLMs and discover significant differences in their performance on this task. We find that strong LLMs like GPT-4 outperform human players by a large margin. We further employ Behavior Cloning (BC) to examine whether a weaker model is capable of imitating a stronger model and generalizing to data or domains, using only the demonstrations from a stronger model. We finally propose to use Reinforcement Learning to enhance reasoning and planning capacity of Vicuna models through episodes of game playing, which lead to significant performance improvement. We hope that this problem offers insights into how autonomous agents could be trained to behave more intelligently in ambiguous circumstances.

**Title:** LLM Lies: Hallucinations are not Bugs, but Features as Adversarial  Examples  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01469  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and PaLM, seem to be knowledgeable and able to adapt to many tasks. However, we still can not completely trust their answer, since LLMs suffer from hallucination--fabricating non-existent facts to cheat users without perception. And the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that non-sense prompts composed of random tokens can also elicit the LLMs to respond with hallucinations. This phenomenon forces us to revisit that hallucination may be another view of adversarial examples, and it shares similar features with conventional adversarial examples as the basic feature of LLMs. Therefore, we formalize an automatic hallucination triggering method as the hallucination attack in an adversarial way. Finally, we explore basic feature of attacked adversarial prompts and propose a simple yet effective defense strategy. Our code is released on GitHub.

**Title:** Direct Inversion: Boosting Diffusion-based Editing with 3 Lines of Code  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01506  
**Abstract:** Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized image generation and editing, offering exceptional realism and diversity. Specifically, in the context of diffusion-based editing, where a source image is edited according to a target prompt, the process commences by acquiring a noisy latent vector corresponding to the source image via the diffusion model. This vector is subsequently fed into separate source and target diffusion branches for editing. The accuracy of this inversion process significantly impacts the final editing outcome, influencing both essential content preservation of the source image and edit fidelity according to the target prompt. Prior inversion techniques aimed at finding a unified solution in both the source and target diffusion branches. However, our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that disentangling these branches leads to a distinct separation of responsibilities for preserving essential content and ensuring edit fidelity. Building on this insight, we introduce "Direct Inversion," a novel technique achieving optimal performance of both branches with just three lines of code. To assess image editing performance, we present PIE-Bench, an editing benchmark with 700 images showcasing diverse scenes and editing types, accompanied by versatile annotations and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Compared to state-of-the-art optimization-based inversion techniques, our solution not only yields superior performance across 8 editing methods but also achieves nearly an order of speed-up.

**Title:** CAT-LM: Training Language Models on Aligned Code And Tests  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01602  
**Abstract:** Testing is an integral part of the software development process. Yet, writing tests is time-consuming and therefore often neglected. Classical test generation tools such as EvoSuite generate behavioral test suites by optimizing for coverage, but tend to produce tests that are hard to understand. Language models trained on code can generate code that is highly similar to that written by humans, but current models are trained to generate each file separately, as is standard practice in natural language processing, and thus fail to consider the code-under-test context when producing a test file. In this work, we propose the Aligned Code And Tests Language Model (CAT-LM), a GPT-style language model with 2.7 Billion parameters, trained on a corpus of Python and Java projects. We utilize a novel pretraining signal that explicitly considers the mapping between code and test files when available. We also drastically increase the maximum sequence length of inputs to 8,192 tokens, 4x more than typical code generation models, to ensure that the code context is available to the model when generating test code. We analyze its usefulness for realistic applications, showing that sampling with filtering (e.g., by compilability, coverage) allows it to efficiently produce tests that achieve coverage similar to ones written by developers while resembling their writing style. By utilizing the code context, CAT-LM generates more valid tests than even much larger language models trained with more data (CodeGen 16B and StarCoder) and substantially outperforms a recent test-specific model (TeCo) at test completion. Overall, our work highlights the importance of incorporating software-specific insights when training language models for code and paves the way to more powerful automated test generation.

**Title:** Operator Learning Meets Numerical Analysis: Improving Neural Networks  through Iterative Methods  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01618  
**Abstract:** Deep neural networks, despite their success in numerous applications, often function without established theoretical foundations. In this paper, we bridge this gap by drawing parallels between deep learning and classical numerical analysis. By framing neural networks as operators with fixed points representing desired solutions, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in iterative methods for operator equations. Under defined conditions, we present convergence proofs based on fixed point theory. We demonstrate that popular architectures, such as diffusion models and AlphaFold, inherently employ iterative operator learning. Empirical assessments highlight that performing iterations through network operators improves performance. We also introduce an iterative graph neural network, PIGN, that further demonstrates benefits of iterations. Our work aims to enhance the understanding of deep learning by merging insights from numerical analysis, potentially guiding the design of future networks with clearer theoretical underpinnings and improved performance.

**Title:** VAL: Interactive Task Learning with GPT Dialog Parsing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01627  
**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning often requires millions of examples to produce static, black-box models. In contrast, interactive task learning (ITL) emphasizes incremental knowledge acquisition from limited instruction provided by humans in modalities such as natural language. However, in practice, ITL systems often suffers from brittle, error-prone language parsing. Large language models (LLMs) are resistant to brittleness but are not interpretable and cannot learn incrementally. We present VAL, an ITL system with a new philosophy for LLM/symbolic integration. By using LLMs only for specific tasks -- such as predicate and argument selection -- within an algorithmic framework, VAL reaps the benefits of LLMs to support interactive learning of hierarchical task knowledge from natural language. Acquired knowledge is human interpretable and generalizes to support execution of novel tasks without additional training. We studied users' interactions with VAL in a video game setting, finding that most users could successfully teach VAL using language they felt was natural.

**Title:** Distributionally Robust Path Integral Control  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01633  
**Abstract:** We consider a continuous-time continuous-space stochastic optimal control problem, where the controller lacks exact knowledge of the underlying diffusion process, relying instead on a finite set of historical disturbance trajectories. In situations where data collection is limited, the controller synthesized from empirical data may exhibit poor performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Distributionally Robust Path Integral (DRPI). The proposed method employs distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to robustify the resulting policy against the unknown diffusion process. Notably, the DRPI scheme shows similarities with risk-sensitive control, which enables us to utilize the path integral control (PIC) framework as an efficient solution scheme. We derive theoretical performance guarantees for the DRPI scheme, which closely aligns with selecting a risk parameter in risk-sensitive control. We validate the efficacy of our scheme and showcase its superiority when compared to risk-neutral PIC policies in the absence of the true diffusion process.

**Title:** Adaptive Visual Scene Understanding: Incremental Scene Graph Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01636  
**Abstract:** Scene graph generation (SGG) involves analyzing images to extract meaningful information about objects and their relationships. Given the dynamic nature of the visual world, it becomes crucial for AI systems to detect new objects and establish their new relationships with existing objects. To address the lack of continual learning methodologies in SGG, we introduce the comprehensive Continual ScenE Graph Generation (CSEGG) dataset along with 3 learning scenarios and 8 evaluation metrics. Our research investigates the continual learning performances of existing SGG methods on the retention of previous object entities and relationships as they learn new ones. Moreover, we also explore how continual object detection enhances generalization in classifying known relationships on unknown objects. We conduct extensive experiments benchmarking and analyzing the classical two-stage SGG methods and the most recent transformer-based SGG methods in continual learning settings, and gain valuable insights into the CSEGG problem. We invite the research community to explore this emerging field of study.

**Title:** CoDBench: A Critical Evaluation of Data-driven Models for Continuous  Dynamical Systems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01650  
**Abstract:** Continuous dynamical systems, characterized by differential equations, are ubiquitously used to model several important problems: plasma dynamics, flow through porous media, weather forecasting, and epidemic dynamics. Recently, a wide range of data-driven models has been used successfully to model these systems. However, in contrast to established fields like computer vision, limited studies are available analyzing the strengths and potential applications of different classes of these models that could steer decision-making in scientific machine learning. Here, we introduce CodBench, an exhaustive benchmarking suite comprising 11 state-of-the-art data-driven models for solving differential equations. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate 4 distinct categories of models, viz., feed forward neural networks, deep operator regression models, frequency-based neural operators, and transformer architectures against 8 widely applicable benchmark datasets encompassing challenges from fluid and solid mechanics. We conduct extensive experiments, assessing the operators' capabilities in learning, zero-shot super-resolution, data efficiency, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency. Interestingly, our findings highlight that current operators struggle with the newer mechanics datasets, motivating the need for more robust neural operators. All the datasets and codes will be shared in an easy-to-use fashion for the scientific community. We hope this resource will be an impetus for accelerated progress and exploration in modeling dynamical systems.

**Title:** PolySketchFormer: Fast Transformers via Sketches for Polynomial Kernels  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01655  
**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of attention in transformer architectures remains a big bottleneck in scaling up large foundation models for long context. In fact, recent theoretical results show the hardness of approximating the output of softmax attention mechanism in sub-quadratic time assuming Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. In this paper, we show how to break this theoretical barrier by replacing softmax with a polynomial function and polynomial sketching. In particular we show that sketches for Polynomial Kernel from the randomized numerical linear algebra literature can be used to approximate the polynomial attention which leads to a significantly faster attention mechanism without assuming any sparse structure for the attention matrix that has been done in many previous works.

**Title:** SYRAC: Synthesize, Rank, and Count  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01662  
**Abstract:** Crowd counting is a critical task in computer vision, with several important applications. However, existing counting methods rely on labor-intensive density map annotations, necessitating the manual localization of each individual pedestrian. While recent efforts have attempted to alleviate the annotation burden through weakly or semi-supervised learning, these approaches fall short of significantly reducing the workload. We propose a novel approach to eliminate the annotation burden by leveraging latent diffusion models to generate synthetic data. However, these models struggle to reliably understand object quantities, leading to noisy annotations when prompted to produce images with a specific quantity of objects. To address this, we use latent diffusion models to create two types of synthetic data: one by removing pedestrians from real images, which generates ranked image pairs with a weak but reliable object quantity signal, and the other by generating synthetic images with a predetermined number of objects, offering a strong but noisy counting signal. Our method utilizes the ranking image pairs for pre-training and then fits a linear layer to the noisy synthetic images using these crowd quantity features. We report state-of-the-art results for unsupervised crowd counting.

**Title:** Keypoint-Augmented Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image  Segmentation with Limited Annotation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01680  
**Abstract:** Pretraining CNN models (i.e., UNet) through self-supervision has become a powerful approach to facilitate medical image segmentation under low annotation regimes. Recent contrastive learning methods encourage similar global representations when the same image undergoes different transformations, or enforce invariance across different image/patch features that are intrinsically correlated. However, CNN-extracted global and local features are limited in capturing long-range spatial dependencies that are essential in biological anatomy. To this end, we present a keypoint-augmented fusion layer that extracts representations preserving both short- and long-range self-attention. In particular, we augment the CNN feature map at multiple scales by incorporating an additional input that learns long-range spatial self-attention among localized keypoint features. Further, we introduce both global and local self-supervised pretraining for the framework. At the global scale, we obtain global representations from both the bottleneck of the UNet, and by aggregating multiscale keypoint features. These global features are subsequently regularized through image-level contrastive objectives. At the local scale, we define a distance-based criterion to first establish correspondences among keypoints and encourage similarity between their features. Through extensive experiments on both MRI and CT segmentation tasks, we demonstrate the architectural advantages of our proposed method in comparison to both CNN and Transformer-based UNets, when all architectures are trained with randomly initialized weights. With our proposed pretraining strategy, our method further outperforms existing SSL methods by producing more robust self-attention and achieving state-of-the-art segmentation results. The code is available at https://github.com/zshyang/kaf.git.

**Title:** DANI: Fast Diffusion Aware Network Inference with Preserving Topological  Structure Property  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01696  
**Abstract:** The fast growth of social networks and their data access limitations in recent years has led to increasing difficulty in obtaining the complete topology of these networks. However, diffusion information over these networks is available, and many algorithms have been proposed to infer the underlying networks using this information. The previously proposed algorithms only focus on inferring more links and ignore preserving the critical topological characteristics of the underlying social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method called DANI to infer the underlying network while preserving its structural properties. It is based on the Markov transition matrix derived from time series cascades, as well as the node-node similarity that can be observed in the cascade behavior from a structural point of view. In addition, the presented method has linear time complexity (increases linearly with the number of nodes, number of cascades, and square of the average length of cascades), and its distributed version in the MapReduce framework is also scalable. We applied the proposed approach to both real and synthetic networks. The experimental results showed that DANI has higher accuracy and lower run time while maintaining structural properties, including modular structure, degree distribution, connected components, density, and clustering coefficients, than well-known network inference methods.

**Title:** Transcending Domains through Text-to-Image Diffusion: A Source-Free  Approach to Domain Adaptation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01701  
**Abstract:** Domain Adaptation (DA) is a method for enhancing a model's performance on a target domain with inadequate annotated data by applying the information the model has acquired from a related source domain with sufficient labeled data. The escalating enforcement of data-privacy regulations like HIPAA, COPPA, FERPA, etc. have sparked a heightened interest in adapting models to novel domains while circumventing the need for direct access to the source data, a problem known as Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SFDA that generates source data using a text-to-image diffusion model trained on the target domain samples. Our method starts by training a text-to-image diffusion model on the labeled target domain samples, which is then fine-tuned using the pre-trained source model to generate samples close to the source data. Finally, we use Domain Adaptation techniques to align the artificially generated source data with the target domain data, resulting in significant performance improvements of the model on the target domain. Through extensive comparison against several baselines on the standard Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the SFDA task.

**Title:** Transformers are efficient hierarchical chemical graph learners  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01704  
**Abstract:** Transformers, adapted from natural language processing, are emerging as a leading approach for graph representation learning. Contemporary graph transformers often treat nodes or edges as separate tokens. This approach leads to computational challenges for even moderately-sized graphs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention complexity with token count. In this paper, we introduce SubFormer, a graph transformer that operates on subgraphs that aggregate information by a message-passing mechanism. This approach reduces the number of tokens and enhances learning long-range interactions. We demonstrate SubFormer on benchmarks for predicting molecular properties from chemical structures and show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art graph transformers at a fraction of the computational cost, with training times on the order of minutes on a consumer-grade graphics card. We interpret the attention weights in terms of chemical structures. We show that SubFormer exhibits limited over-smoothing and avoids over-squashing, which is prevalent in traditional graph neural networks.

**Title:** Can GPT-4 Replicate Empirical Software Engineering Research?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01727  
**Abstract:** Empirical software engineering research on production systems has brought forth a better understanding of the software engineering process for practitioners and researchers alike. However, only a small subset of production systems is studied, limiting the impact of this research. While software engineering practitioners benefit from replicating research on their own data, this poses its own set of challenges, since performing replications requires a deep understanding of research methodologies and subtle nuances in software engineering data. Given that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, show promise in tackling both software engineering- and science-related tasks, these models could help democratize empirical software engineering research.

**Title:** Sampling Multimodal Distributions with the Vanilla Score: Benefits of  Data-Based Initialization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01762  
**Abstract:** There is a long history, as well as a recent explosion of interest, in statistical and generative modeling approaches based on score functions -- derivatives of the log-likelihood of a distribution. In seminal works, Hyv\"arinen proposed vanilla score matching as a way to learn distributions from data by computing an estimate of the score function of the underlying ground truth, and established connections between this method and established techniques like Contrastive Divergence and Pseudolikelihood estimation. It is by now well-known that vanilla score matching has significant difficulties learning multimodal distributions. Although there are various ways to overcome this difficulty, the following question has remained unanswered -- is there a natural way to sample multimodal distributions using just the vanilla score? Inspired by a long line of related experimental works, we prove that the Langevin diffusion with early stopping, initialized at the empirical distribution, and run on a score function estimated from data successfully generates natural multimodal distributions (mixtures of log-concave distributions).

**Title:** SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01777  
**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has made breakthroughs in recent years on tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, transformers struggle with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation, and previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix, and often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and linear approaches may also lose interpretability if they do not produce full quadratic attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then creates a sparse approximation to the full attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show a roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-125M baseline, while SEA achieves an even better perplexity than OPT-125M, using roughly half as much memory as OPT-125M. Moreover, SEA maintains an interpretable attention matrix and can utilize knowledge distillation to lower the complexity of existing pretrained transformers. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited devices with less memory.

**Title:** HallE-Switch: Rethinking and Controlling Object Existence Hallucinations  in Large Vision Language Models for Detailed Caption  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01779  
**Abstract:** Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve remarkable progress, yet there remains significant uncertainty regarding their ability to accurately apprehend visual details, that is, in performing detailed captioning. To address this, we introduce \textit{CCEval}, a GPT-4 assisted evaluation method tailored for detailed captioning. Interestingly, while LVLMs demonstrate minimal object existence hallucination in existing VQA benchmarks, our proposed evaluation reveals continued susceptibility to such hallucinations. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and attribute such hallucinations, including image resolution, the language decoder size, and instruction data amount, quality, granularity. Our findings underscore the unwarranted inference when the language description includes details at a finer object granularity than what the vision module can ground or verify, thus inducing hallucination. To control such hallucinations, we further attribute the reliability of captioning to contextual knowledge (involving only contextually grounded objects) and parametric knowledge (containing inferred objects by the model). Thus, we introduce $\textit{HallE-Switch}$, a controllable LVLM in terms of $\textbf{Hall}$ucination in object $\textbf{E}$xistence. HallE-Switch can condition the captioning to shift between (i) exclusively depicting contextual knowledge for grounded objects and (ii) blending it with parametric knowledge to imagine inferred objects. Our method reduces hallucination by 44% compared to LLaVA$_{7B}$ and maintains the same object coverage.

**Title:** Can large language models provide useful feedback on research papers? A  large-scale empirical analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01783  
**Abstract:** Expert feedback lays the foundation of rigorous research. However, the rapid growth of scholarly production and intricate knowledge specialization challenge the conventional scientific feedback mechanisms. High-quality peer reviews are increasingly difficult to obtain. Researchers who are more junior or from under-resourced settings have especially hard times getting timely feedback. With the breakthrough of large language models (LLM) such as GPT-4, there is growing interest in using LLMs to generate scientific feedback on research manuscripts. However, the utility of LLM-generated feedback has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we created an automated pipeline using GPT-4 to provide comments on the full PDFs of scientific papers. We evaluated the quality of GPT-4's feedback through two large-scale studies. We first quantitatively compared GPT-4's generated feedback with human peer reviewer feedback in 15 Nature family journals (3,096 papers in total) and the ICLR machine learning conference (1,709 papers). The overlap in the points raised by GPT-4 and by human reviewers (average overlap 30.85% for Nature journals, 39.23% for ICLR) is comparable to the overlap between two human reviewers (average overlap 28.58% for Nature journals, 35.25% for ICLR). The overlap between GPT-4 and human reviewers is larger for the weaker papers. We then conducted a prospective user study with 308 researchers from 110 US institutions in the field of AI and computational biology to understand how researchers perceive feedback generated by our GPT-4 system on their own papers. Overall, more than half (57.4%) of the users found GPT-4 generated feedback helpful/very helpful and 82.4% found it more beneficial than feedback from at least some human reviewers. While our findings show that LLM-generated feedback can help researchers, we also identify several limitations.

**Title:** TempoNet: Empowering long-term Knee Joint Angle Prediction with Dynamic  Temporal Attention in Exoskeleton Control  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01795  
**Abstract:** In the realm of exoskeleton control, achieving precise control poses challenges due to the mechanical delay of exoskeletons. To address this, incorporating future gait trajectories as feed-forward input has been proposed. However, existing deep learning models for gait prediction mainly focus on short-term predictions, leaving the long-term performance of these models relatively unexplored. In this study, we present TempoNet, a novel model specifically designed for precise knee joint angle prediction. By harnessing dynamic temporal attention within the Transformer-based architecture, TempoNet surpasses existing models in forecasting knee joint angles over extended time horizons. Notably, our model achieves a remarkable reduction of 10\% to 185\% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for 100 ms ahead forecasting compared to other transformer-based models, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, TempoNet exhibits further reliability and superiority over the baseline Transformer model, outperforming it by 14\% in MAE for the 200 ms prediction horizon. These findings highlight the efficacy of TempoNet in accurately predicting knee joint angles and emphasize the importance of incorporating dynamic temporal attention. TempoNet's capability to enhance knee joint angle prediction accuracy opens up possibilities for precise control, improved rehabilitation outcomes, advanced sports performance analysis, and deeper insights into biomechanical research.

**Title:** Improvement and Enhancement of YOLOv5 Small Target Recognition Based on  Multi-module Optimization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01806  
**Abstract:** In this paper, the limitations of YOLOv5s model on small target detection task are deeply studied and improved. The performance of the model is successfully enhanced by introducing GhostNet-based convolutional module, RepGFPN-based Neck module optimization, CA and Transformer's attention mechanism, and loss function improvement using NWD. The experimental results validate the positive impact of these improvement strategies on model precision, recall and mAP. In particular, the improved model shows significant superiority in dealing with complex backgrounds and tiny targets in real-world application tests. This study provides an effective optimization strategy for the YOLOv5s model on small target detection, and lays a solid foundation for future related research and applications.

**Title:** Mel-Band RoFormer for Music Source Separation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01809  
**Abstract:** Recently, multi-band spectrogram-based approaches such as Band-Split RNN (BSRNN) have demonstrated promising results for music source separation. In our recent work, we introduce the BS-RoFormer model which inherits the idea of band-split scheme in BSRNN at the front-end, and then uses the hierarchical Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to model the inner-band and inter-band sequences for multi-band mask estimation. This model has achieved state-of-the-art performance, but the band-split scheme is defined empirically, without analytic supports from the literature. In this paper, we propose Mel-RoFormer, which adopts the Mel-band scheme that maps the frequency bins into overlapped subbands according to the mel scale. In contract, the band-split mapping in BSRNN and BS-RoFormer is non-overlapping and designed based on heuristics. Using the MUSDB18HQ dataset for experiments, we demonstrate that Mel-RoFormer outperforms BS-RoFormer in the separation tasks of vocals, drums, and other stems.

**Title:** Amazing Combinatorial Creation: Acceptable Swap-Sampling for  Text-to-Image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01819  
**Abstract:** Exploring a machine learning system to generate meaningful combinatorial object images from multiple textual descriptions, emulating human creativity, is a significant challenge as humans are able to construct amazing combinatorial objects, but machines strive to emulate data distribution. In this paper, we develop a straightforward yet highly effective technique called acceptable swap-sampling to generate a combinatorial object image that exhibits novelty and surprise, utilizing text concepts of different objects. Initially, we propose a swapping mechanism that constructs a novel embedding by exchanging column vectors of two text embeddings for generating a new combinatorial image through a cutting-edge diffusion model. Furthermore, we design an acceptable region by managing suitable CLIP distances between the new image and the original concept generations, increasing the likelihood of accepting the new image with a high-quality combination. This region allows us to efficiently sample a small subset from a new image pool generated by using randomly exchanging column vectors. Lastly, we employ a segmentation method to compare CLIP distances among the segmented components, ultimately selecting the most promising object image from the sampled subset. Our experiments focus on text pairs of objects from ImageNet, and our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent methods such as Stable-Diffusion2, DALLE2, ERNIE-ViLG2 and Bing in generating novel and surprising object images, even when the associated concepts appear to be implausible, such as lionfish-abacus. Furthermore, during the sampling process, our approach without training and human preference is also comparable to PickScore and HPSv2 trained using human preference datasets.

**Title:** MIMO-NeRF: Fast Neural Rendering with Multi-input Multi-output Neural  Radiance Fields  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01821  
**Abstract:** Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results for novel view synthesis. However, they depend on the repetitive use of a single-input single-output multilayer perceptron (SISO MLP) that maps 3D coordinates and view direction to the color and volume density in a sample-wise manner, which slows the rendering. We propose a multi-input multi-output NeRF (MIMO-NeRF) that reduces the number of MLPs running by replacing the SISO MLP with a MIMO MLP and conducting mappings in a group-wise manner. One notable challenge with this approach is that the color and volume density of each point can differ according to a choice of input coordinates in a group, which can lead to some notable ambiguity. We also propose a self-supervised learning method that regularizes the MIMO MLP with multiple fast reformulated MLPs to alleviate this ambiguity without using pretrained models. The results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation including comparative and ablation studies are presented to show that MIMO-NeRF obtains a good trade-off between speed and quality with a reasonable training time. We then demonstrate that MIMO-NeRF is compatible with and complementary to previous advancements in NeRFs by applying it to two representative fast NeRFs, i.e., a NeRF with sample reduction (DONeRF) and a NeRF with alternative representations (TensoRF).

**Title:** Selective Feature Adapter for Dense Vision Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01843  
**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models, e.g., Swin Transformer, are successful in numerous downstream for dense prediction vision tasks. However, one major issue is the cost/storage of their huge amount of parameters, which becomes increasingly challenging to handle with the growing amount of vision tasks. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to alleviate the issue, namely selective feature adapter (SFA). It achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance under any given budget of trainable parameters, and demonstrates comparable or better performance than fully fine-tuned models across various dense tasks. Specifically, SFA consists of external adapters and internal adapters which are sequentially operated over a transformer model. For external adapters, we properly select the places and amount of additional multilayer perception (MLP). For internal adapters, we transform a few task-important parameters inside the transformer, which are automatically discovered through a simple yet effective lottery ticket algorithm. Our experiments show that the dual adapter module, a.k.a SFA, is essential to achieve the best trade-off on dense vision tasks, such as segmentation, detection and depth-estimation, outperforming other adapters with a single module.

**Title:** Benchmarking and Improving Generator-Validator Consistency of Language  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01846  
**Abstract:** As of September 2023, ChatGPT correctly answers "what is 7+8" with 15, but when asked "7+8=15, True or False" it responds with "False". This inconsistency between generating and validating an answer is prevalent in language models (LMs) and erodes trust. In this paper, we propose a framework for measuring the consistency between generation and validation (which we call generator-validator consistency, or GV-consistency), finding that even GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LM, is GV-consistent only 76% of the time. To improve the consistency of LMs, we propose to finetune on the filtered generator and validator responses that are GV-consistent, and call this approach consistency fine-tuning. We find that this approach improves GV-consistency of Alpaca-30B from 60% to 93%, and the improvement extrapolates to unseen tasks and domains (e.g., GV-consistency for positive style transfers extrapolates to unseen styles like humor). In addition to improving consistency, consistency fine-tuning improves both generator quality and validator accuracy without using any labeled data. Evaluated across 6 tasks, including math questions, knowledge-intensive QA, and instruction following, our method improves the generator quality by 16% and the validator accuracy by 6.3% across all tasks.

**Title:** DeepDecipher: Accessing and Investigating Neuron Activation in Large  Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01870  
**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, there is an urgent need for interpretable and transparent tools. Current methods are difficult to implement, and accessible tools to analyze model internals are lacking. To bridge this gap, we present DeepDecipher - an API and interface for probing neurons in transformer models' MLP layers. DeepDecipher makes the outputs of advanced interpretability techniques for LLMs readily available. The easy-to-use interface also makes inspecting these complex models more intuitive. This paper outlines DeepDecipher's design and capabilities. We demonstrate how to analyze neurons, compare models, and gain insights into model behavior. For example, we contrast DeepDecipher's functionality with similar tools like Neuroscope and OpenAI's Neuron Explainer. DeepDecipher enables efficient, scalable analysis of LLMs. By granting access to state-of-the-art interpretability methods, DeepDecipher makes LLMs more transparent, trustworthy, and safe. Researchers, engineers, and developers can quickly diagnose issues, audit systems, and advance the field.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated significant potential for representing 3D scene appearances as implicit neural networks, enabling the synthesis of high-fidelity novel views. However, the lengthy training and rendering process hinders the widespread adoption of this promising technique for real-time rendering applications. To address this issue, we present an effective adaptive multi-NeRF method designed to accelerate the neural rendering process for large scenes with unbalanced workloads due to varying scene complexities.

**Title:** MFOS: Model-Free & One-Shot Object Pose Estimation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01897  
**Abstract:** Existing learning-based methods for object pose estimation in RGB images are mostly model-specific or category based. They lack the capability to generalize to new object categories at test time, hence severely hindering their practicability and scalability. Notably, recent attempts have been made to solve this issue, but they still require accurate 3D data of the object surface at both train and test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that can estimate in a single forward pass the pose of objects never seen during training, given minimum input. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art approaches, which rely on task-specific modules, our proposed model is entirely based on a transformer architecture, which can benefit from recently proposed 3D-geometry general pretraining. We conduct extensive experiments and report state-of-the-art one-shot performance on the challenging LINEMOD benchmark. Finally, extensive ablations allow us to determine good practices with this relatively new type of architecture in the field.

**Title:** Navigating Cultural Chasms: Exploring and Unlocking the Cultural POV of  Text-To-Image Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01929  
**Abstract:** Text-To-Image (TTI) models, exemplified by DALL-E and StableDiffusion, have recently gained prominence for their remarkable zero-shot capabilities in generating images guided by textual prompts. Language, as a conduit of culture, plays a pivotal role in these models' multilingual capabilities, which in turn shape their cultural agency. In this study, we explore the cultural perception embedded in TTI models by characterizing culture across three hierarchical tiers: cultural dimensions, cultural domains, and cultural concepts. We propose a comprehensive suite of evaluation techniques, including intrinsic evaluations using the CLIP space, extrinsic evaluations with a Visual-Question-Answer (VQA) model, and human assessments, to discern TTI cultural perceptions. To facilitate our research, we introduce the CulText2I dataset, derived from four diverse TTI models and spanning ten languages. Our experiments reveal insights into these models' cultural awareness, cultural distinctions, and the unlocking of cultural features, releasing the potential for cross-cultural applications.

**Title:** Driving with LLMs: Fusing Object-Level Vector Modality for Explainable  Autonomous Driving  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01957  
**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in the autonomous driving sector, particularly in generalization and interpretability. We introduce a unique object-level multimodal LLM architecture that merges vectorized numeric modalities with a pre-trained LLM to improve context understanding in driving situations. We also present a new dataset of 160k QA pairs derived from 10k driving scenarios, paired with high quality control commands collected with RL agent and question answer pairs generated by teacher LLM (GPT-3.5). A distinct pretraining strategy is devised to align numeric vector modalities with static LLM representations using vector captioning language data. We also introduce an evaluation metric for Driving QA and demonstrate our LLM-driver's proficiency in interpreting driving scenarios, answering questions, and decision-making. Our findings highlight the potential of LLM-based driving action generation in comparison to traditional behavioral cloning. We make our benchmark, datasets, and model available for further exploration.

**Title:** Understanding Masked Autoencoders From a Local Contrastive Perspective  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01994  
**Abstract:** Masked AutoEncoder(MAE) has revolutionized the field of self-supervised learning with its simple yet effective masking and reconstruction strategies. However, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance across various downstream vision tasks, the underlying mechanisms that drive MAE's efficacy are less well-explored compared to the canonical contrastive learning paradigm. In this paper, we explore a new perspective to explain what truly contributes to the "rich hidden representations inside the MAE". Firstly, concerning MAE's generative pretraining pathway, with a unique encoder-decoder architecture to reconstruct images from aggressive masking, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the decoder's behaviors. We empirically find that MAE's decoder mainly learns local features with a limited receptive field, adhering to the well-known Locality Principle. Building upon this locality assumption, we propose a theoretical framework that reformulates the reconstruction-based MAE into a local region-level contrastive learning form for improved understanding. Furthermore, to substantiate the local contrastive nature of MAE, we introduce a Siamese architecture that combines the essence of MAE and contrastive learning without masking and explicit decoder, which sheds light on a unified and more flexible self-supervised learning framework.

**Title:** L2MAC: Large Language Model Automatic Computer for Unbounded Code  Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02003  
**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are constrained by the fixed context window of the underlying transformer architecture, hindering their ability to produce long and logically consistent code. Memory-augmented LLMs are a promising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long code generation tasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to the concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that cannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical LLM-based stored-program automatic computer for long and consistent code generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction registry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given task, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs. Each instruction is executed by a separate LLM instance, whose context is managed by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to ensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC to generate virtually unbounded code structures, bypassing the constraints of the finite context window while producing code that fulfills complex user-specified requirements. We empirically show that L2MAC succeeds in generating large code bases for system design tasks where other coding methods fall short in implementing user requirements and provide insight into the reasons for this performance gap.

**Title:** Spectral operator learning for parametric PDEs without data reliance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02013  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce the Spectral Coefficient Learning via Operator Network (SCLON), a novel operator learning-based approach for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need for data harnessing. The cornerstone of our method is the spectral methodology that employs expansions using orthogonal functions, such as Fourier series and Legendre polynomials, enabling accurate PDE solutions with fewer grid points. By merging the merits of spectral methods - encompassing high accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and the exact fulfillment of boundary conditions - with the prowess of deep neural networks, SCLON offers a transformative strategy. Our approach not only eliminates the need for paired input-output training data, which typically requires extensive numerical computations, but also effectively learns and predicts solutions of complex parametric PDEs, ranging from singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations to the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing scientific machine learning techniques, offering solutions for multiple instances of parametric PDEs without harnessing data. The mathematical framework is robust and reliable, with a well-developed loss function derived from the weak formulation, ensuring accurate approximation of solutions while exactly satisfying boundary conditions. The method's efficacy is further illustrated through its ability to accurately predict intricate natural behaviors like the Kolmogorov flow and boundary layers. In essence, our work pioneers a compelling avenue for parametric PDE solutions, serving as a bridge between traditional numerical methodologies and cutting-edge machine learning techniques in the realm of scientific computation.

**Title:** An evaluation of pre-trained models for feature extraction in image  classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02037  
**Abstract:** In recent years, we have witnessed a considerable increase in performance in image classification tasks. This performance improvement is mainly due to the adoption of deep learning techniques. Generally, deep learning techniques demand a large set of annotated data, making it a challenge when applying it to small datasets. In this scenario, transfer learning strategies have become a promising alternative to overcome these issues. This work aims to compare the performance of different pre-trained neural networks for feature extraction in image classification tasks. We evaluated 16 different pre-trained models in four image datasets. Our results demonstrate that the best general performance along the datasets was achieved by CLIP-ViT-B and ViT-H-14, where the CLIP-ResNet50 model had similar performance but with less variability. Therefore, our study provides evidence supporting the choice of models for feature extraction in image classification tasks.

**Title:** The Inhibitor: ReLU and Addition-Based Attention for Efficient  Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02041  
**Abstract:** To enhance the computational efficiency of quantized Transformers, we replace the dot-product and Softmax-based attention with an alternative mechanism involving addition and ReLU activation only. This side-steps the expansion to double precision often required by matrix multiplication and avoids costly Softmax evaluations but maintains much of the core functionality of conventional dot-product attention. It can enable more efficient execution and support larger quantized Transformer models on resource-constrained hardware or alternative arithmetic systems like homomorphic encryption. Training experiments on four common benchmark tasks show test set prediction scores comparable to those of conventional Transformers with dot-product attention. Our scaling experiments also suggest significant computational savings, both in plaintext and under encryption. In particular, we believe that the ReLU and addition-based attention mechanism introduced in this paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic encryption by avoiding the costly multiplication of encrypted variables.

**Title:** Video Transformers under Occlusion: How Physics and Background  Attributes Impact Large Models for Robotic Manipulation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02044  
**Abstract:** As transformer architectures and dataset sizes continue to scale, the need to understand the specific dataset factors affecting model performance becomes increasingly urgent. This paper investigates how object physics attributes (color, friction coefficient, shape) and background characteristics (static, dynamic, background complexity) influence the performance of Video Transformers in trajectory prediction tasks under occlusion. Beyond mere occlusion challenges, this study aims to investigate three questions: How do object physics attributes and background characteristics influence the model performance? What kinds of attributes are most influential to the model generalization? Is there a data saturation point for large transformer model performance within a single task? To facilitate this research, we present OccluManip, a real-world video-based robot pushing dataset comprising 460,000 consistent recordings of objects with different physics and varying backgrounds. 1.4 TB and in total 1278 hours of high-quality videos of flexible temporal length along with target object trajectories are collected, accommodating tasks with different temporal requirements. Additionally, we propose Video Occlusion Transformer (VOT), a generic video-transformer-based network achieving an average 96% accuracy across all 18 sub-datasets provided in OccluManip. OccluManip and VOT will be released at: https://github.com/ShutongJIN/OccluManip.git

**Title:** Improving web element localization by using a large language model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02046  
**Abstract:** Web-based test automation heavily relies on accurately finding web elements. Traditional methods compare attributes but don't grasp the context and meaning of elements and words. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, which can show human-like reasoning abilities on some tasks, offers new opportunities for software engineering and web element localization. This paper introduces and evaluates VON Similo LLM, an enhanced web element localization approach. Using an LLM, it selects the most likely web element from the top-ranked ones identified by the existing VON Similo method, ideally aiming to get closer to human-like selection accuracy. An experimental study was conducted using 804 web element pairs from 48 real-world web applications. We measured the number of correctly identified elements as well as the execution times, comparing the effectiveness and efficiency of VON Similo LLM against the baseline algorithm. In addition, motivations from the LLM were recorded and analyzed for all instances where the original approach failed to find the right web element. VON Similo LLM demonstrated improved performance, reducing failed localizations from 70 to 39 (out of 804), a 44 percent reduction. Despite its slower execution time and additional costs of using the GPT-4 model, the LLMs human-like reasoning showed promise in enhancing web element localization. LLM technology can enhance web element identification in GUI test automation, reducing false positives and potentially lowering maintenance costs. However, further research is necessary to fully understand LLMs capabilities, limitations, and practical use in GUI testing.

**Title:** AlignDiff: Aligning Diverse Human Preferences via Behavior-Customisable  Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02054  
**Abstract:** Aligning agent behaviors with diverse human preferences remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL), owing to the inherent abstractness and mutability of human preferences. To address these issues, we propose AlignDiff, a novel framework that leverages RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) to quantify human preferences, covering abstractness, and utilizes them to guide diffusion planning for zero-shot behavior customizing, covering mutability. AlignDiff can accurately match user-customized behaviors and efficiently switch from one to another. To build the framework, we first establish the multi-perspective human feedback datasets, which contain comparisons for the attributes of diverse behaviors, and then train an attribute strength model to predict quantified relative strengths. After relabeling behavioral datasets with relative strengths, we proceed to train an attribute-conditioned diffusion model, which serves as a planner with the attribute strength model as a director for preference aligning at the inference phase. We evaluate AlignDiff on various locomotion tasks and demonstrate its superior performance on preference matching, switching, and covering compared to other baselines. Its capability of completing unseen downstream tasks under human instructions also showcases the promising potential for human-AI collaboration.

This research explores the domain of microbial activity within the complex matrix of 3D soil structures, providing valuable understanding into both the existence and uniqueness of solutions and the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding PDE model. Our investigation results in the discovery of a global attractor, a fundamental feature with significant implications for long-term system behavior. To enhance the clarity of our findings, numerical simulations are employed to visually illustrate the attributes of this global attractor.

**Title:** De Novo Drug Design with Joint Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02066  
**Abstract:** De novo drug design requires simultaneously generating novel molecules outside of training data and predicting their target properties, making it a hard task for generative models. To address this, we propose Joint Transformer that combines a Transformer decoder, a Transformer encoder, and a predictor in a joint generative model with shared weights. We show that training the model with a penalized log-likelihood objective results in state-of-the-art performance in molecule generation, while decreasing the prediction error on newly sampled molecules, as compared to a fine-tuned decoder-only Transformer, by 42%. Finally, we propose a probabilistic black-box optimization algorithm that employs Joint Transformer to generate novel molecules with improved target properties, as compared to the training data, outperforming other SMILES-based optimization methods in de novo drug design.

**Title:** Towards End-to-End Embodied Decision Making via Multi-modal Large  Language Model: Explorations with GPT4-Vision and Beyond  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02071  
**Abstract:** In this study, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in improving embodied decision-making processes for agents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used due to their advanced reasoning skills and vast world knowledge, MLLMs like GPT4-Vision offer enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities. We investigate whether state-of-the-art MLLMs can handle embodied decision-making in an end-to-end manner and whether collaborations between LLMs and MLLMs can enhance decision-making. To address these questions, we introduce a new benchmark called PCA-EVAL, which evaluates embodied decision-making from the perspectives of Perception, Cognition, and Action. Additionally, we propose HOLMES, a multi-agent cooperation framework that allows LLMs to leverage MLLMs and APIs to gather multimodal information for informed decision-making. We compare end-to-end embodied decision-making and HOLMES on our benchmark and find that the GPT4-Vision model demonstrates strong end-to-end embodied decision-making abilities, outperforming GPT4-HOLMES in terms of average decision accuracy (+3%). However, this performance is exclusive to the latest GPT4-Vision model, surpassing the open-source state-of-the-art MLLM by 26%. Our results indicate that powerful MLLMs like GPT4-Vision hold promise for decision-making in embodied agents, offering new avenues for MLLM research.

**Title:** A Variable Eddington Factor Model for Thermal Radiative Transfer with  Closure based on Data-Driven Shape Function  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02072  
**Abstract:** A new variable Eddington factor (VEF) model is presented for nonlinear problems of thermal radiative transfer (TRT). The VEF model is a data-driven one that acts on known (a-priori) radiation-diffusion solutions for material temperatures in the TRT problem. A linear auxiliary problem is constructed for the radiative transfer equation (RTE) with opacities and emission source evaluated at the known material temperatures. The solution to this RTE approximates the specific intensity distribution for the problem in all phase-space and time. It is applied as a shape function to define the Eddington tensor for the presented VEF model. The shape function computed via the auxiliary RTE problem will capture some degree of transport effects within the TRT problem. The VEF moment equations closed with this approximate Eddington tensor will thus carry with them these captured transport effects. In this study, the temperature data comes from multigroup $P_1$, $P_{1/3}$, and flux-limited diffusion radiative transfer (RT) models. The proposed VEF model can be interpreted as a transport-corrected diffusion reduced-order model. Numerical results are presented on the Fleck-Cummings test problem which models a supersonic wavefront of radiation. The presented VEF model is shown to reliably improve accuracy by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the considered radiation-diffusion model solutions to the TRT problem.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02104  
**Abstract:** Ever since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, a rising concern is whether ChatGPT will replace programmers and kill jobs. Motivated by this widespread concern, we conducted an empirical study to systematically compare ChatGPT against programmers in question-answering and software-maintaining. We reused a dataset introduced by prior work, which includes 130 StackOverflow (SO) discussion threads referred to by the Java developers of 357 GitHub projects. We mainly investigated three research questions (RQs). First, how does ChatGPT compare with programmers when answering technical questions? Second, how do developers perceive the differences between ChatGPT's answers and SO answers? Third, how does ChatGPT compare with humans when revising code for maintenance requests?

**Title:** Instance Needs More Care: Rewriting Prompts for Instances Yields Better  Zero-Shot Performance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02107  
**Abstract:** Enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks in zero-shot has been an appealing goal owing to its labor-saving (i.e., requiring no task-specific annotations); as such, zero-shot prompting approaches also enjoy better task generalizability. To improve LLMs' zero-shot performance, prior work has focused on devising more effective task instructions (e.g., ``let's think step by step'' ). However, we argue that, in order for an LLM to solve them correctly in zero-shot, individual test instances need more carefully designed and customized instructions. To this end, we propose PRoMPTd, an approach that rewrites the task prompt for each individual test input to be more specific, unambiguous, and complete, so as to provide better guidance to the task LLM. We evaluated PRoMPTd on eight datasets covering tasks including arithmetics, logical reasoning, and code generation, using GPT-4 as the task LLM. Notably, \algoname achieves an absolute improvement of around 10\% on the complex MATH dataset and 5\% on the code generation task on HumanEval, outperforming conventional zero-shot methods. In addition, we also showed that the rewritten prompt can provide better interpretability of how the LLM resolves each test instance, which can potentially be leveraged as a defense mechanism against adversarial prompting. The source code and dataset can be obtained from https://github.com/salokr/PRoMPTd

**Title:** SIEVE: Multimodal Dataset Pruning Using Image Captioning Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02110  
**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are pretrained on large, diverse, and noisy web-crawled datasets. This underscores the critical need for dataset pruning, as the quality of these datasets is strongly correlated with the performance of VLMs on downstream tasks. Using CLIPScore from a pretrained model to only train models using highly-aligned samples is one of the most successful methods for pruning.We argue that this approach suffers from multiple limitations including: 1) false positives due to spurious correlations captured by the pretrained CLIP model, 2) false negatives due to poor discrimination between hard and bad samples, and 3) biased ranking towards samples similar to the pretrained CLIP dataset. We propose a pruning method, SIEVE, that employs synthetic captions generated by image-captioning models pretrained on small, diverse, and well-aligned image-text pairs to evaluate the alignment of noisy image-text pairs. To bridge the gap between the limited diversity of generated captions and the high diversity of alternative text (alt-text), we estimate the semantic textual similarity in the embedding space of a language model pretrained on billions of sentences. Using DataComp, a multimodal dataset filtering benchmark, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the large scale pool, and competitive results on the medium scale pool, surpassing CLIPScore-based filtering by 1.7% and 2.6% on average, on 38 downstream tasks.

**Title:** HPCClusterScape: Increasing Transparency and Efficiency of Shared  High-Performance Computing Clusters for Large-scale AI Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02120  
**Abstract:** The emergence of large-scale AI models, like GPT-4, has significantly impacted academia and industry, driving the demand for high-performance computing (HPC) to accelerate workloads. To address this, we present HPCClusterScape, a visualization system that enhances the efficiency and transparency of shared HPC clusters for large-scale AI models. HPCClusterScape provides a comprehensive overview of system-level (e.g., partitions, hosts, and workload status) and application-level (e.g., identification of experiments and researchers) information, allowing HPC operators and machine learning researchers to monitor resource utilization and identify issues through customizable violation rules.

**Title:** Probabilistically Rewired Message-Passing Neural Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02156  
**Abstract:** Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) emerged as powerful tools for processing graph-structured input. However, they operate on a fixed input graph structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent progress in exact and differentiable $k$-subset sampling, we devise probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance compared to traditional MPNN models and recent graph transformer architectures.

**Title:** Large Language Models Meet Knowledge Graphs to Answer Factoid Questions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02166  
**Abstract:** Recently, it has been shown that the incorporation of structured knowledge into Large Language Models significantly improves the results for a variety of NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a method for exploring pre-trained Text-to-Text Language Models enriched with additional information from Knowledge Graphs for answering factoid questions. More specifically, we propose an algorithm for subgraphs extraction from a Knowledge Graph based on question entities and answer candidates. Then, we procure easily interpreted information with Transformer-based models through the linearization of the extracted subgraphs. Final re-ranking of the answer candidates with the extracted information boosts Hits@1 scores of the pre-trained text-to-text language models by 4-6%.

**Title:** Editing Personality for LLMs  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02168  
**Abstract:** This paper introduces an innovative task focused on editing the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct a new benchmark dataset PersonalityEdit to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that not only align with a specified topic but also embody the targeted personality trait. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our intriguing findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues. We anticipate that our work can provide the NLP community with insights. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

**Title:** Dynamic LLM-Agent Network: An LLM-agent Collaboration Framework with  Agent Team Optimization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02170  
**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) agents have been shown effective on a wide range of tasks, and by ensembling multiple LLM agents, their performances could be further improved. Existing approaches employ a fixed set of agents to interact with each other in a static architecture, which limits their generalizability to various tasks and requires strong human prior in designing these agents. In this work, we propose to construct a strategic team of agents communicating in a dynamic interaction architecture based on the task query. Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Agent Network ($\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-agent collaboration on complicated tasks like reasoning and code generation. DyLAN enables agents to interact for multiple rounds in a dynamic architecture with inference-time agent selection and an early-stopping mechanism to improve performance and efficiency. We further design an automatic agent team optimization algorithm based on an unsupervised metric termed $\textit{Agent Importance Score}$, enabling the selection of best agents based on the contribution each agent makes. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN performs well in both reasoning and code generation tasks with reasonable computational cost. DyLAN achieves 13.0% and 13.3% improvement on MATH and HumanEval, respectively, compared to a single execution on GPT-35-turbo. On specific subjects of MMLU, agent team optimization in DyLAN increases accuracy by up to 25.0%.

**Title:** Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models' Vacillations in Judgement  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02174  
**Abstract:** With the emergence of generative conversational large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, serving as virtual assistants in various fields, the stability and reliability of their responses have become crucial. However, during usage, it has been observed that these models tend to waver in their judgements when confronted with follow-up questions from users expressing skepticism or disagreement. In this work, we draw inspiration from questioning strategies in education and propose a \textsc{Follow-up Questioning Mechanism} along with two evaluation metrics to assess the judgement consistency of LLMs before and after exposure to disturbances. We evaluate the judgement consistency of ChatGPT, PaLM2-Bison, and Vicuna-13B under this mechanism across eight reasoning benchmarks. Empirical results show that even when the initial answers are correct, judgement consistency sharply decreases when LLMs face disturbances such as questioning, negation, or misleading. Additionally, we study these models' judgement consistency under various settings (sampling temperature and prompts) to validate this issue further, observing the impact of prompt tone and conducting an in-depth error analysis for deeper behavioral insights. Furthermore, we also explore several prompting methods to mitigate this issue and demonstrate their effectiveness\footnote{\url{https://github.com/NUSTM/LLMs-Waver-In-Judgements}}.

**Title:** Extraction of Medication and Temporal Relation from Clinical Text by  Harnessing Different Deep Learning Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02229  
**Abstract:** Clinical texts, represented in electronic medical records (EMRs), contain rich medical information and are essential for disease prediction, personalised information recommendation, clinical decision support, and medication pattern mining and measurement. Relation extractions between medication mentions and temporal information can further help clinicians better understand the patients' treatment history. To evaluate the performances of deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs) in medication extraction and temporal relations classification, we carry out an empirical investigation of \textbf{MedTem} project using several advanced learning structures including BiLSTM-CRF and CNN-BiLSTM for a clinical domain named entity recognition (NER), and BERT-CNN for temporal relation extraction (RE), in addition to the exploration of different word embedding techniques. Furthermore, we also designed a set of post-processing roles to generate structured output on medications and the temporal relation. Our experiments show that CNN-BiLSTM slightly wins the BiLSTM-CRF model on the i2b2-2009 clinical NER task yielding 75.67, 77.83, and 78.17 for precision, recall, and F1 scores using Macro Average. BERT-CNN model also produced reasonable evaluation scores 64.48, 67.17, and 65.03 for P/R/F1 using Macro Avg on the temporal relation extraction test set from i2b2-2012 challenges.

**Title:** Leveraging Diffusion Disentangled Representations to Mitigate Shortcuts  in Underspecified Visual Tasks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02230  
**Abstract:** Spurious correlations in the data, where multiple cues are predictive of the target labels, often lead to shortcut learning phenomena, where a model may rely on erroneous, easy-to-learn, cues while ignoring reliable ones. In this work, we propose an ensemble diversification framework exploiting the generation of synthetic counterfactuals using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs). We discover that DPMs have the inherent capability to represent multiple visual cues independently, even when they are largely correlated in the training data. We leverage this characteristic to encourage model diversity and empirically show the efficacy of the approach with respect to several diversification objectives. We show that diffusion-guided diversification can lead models to avert attention from shortcut cues, achieving ensemble diversity performance comparable to previous methods requiring additional data collection.

**Title:** Hierarchical Generation of Human-Object Interactions with Diffusion  Probabilistic Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02242  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel approach to generating the 3D motion of a human interacting with a target object, with a focus on solving the challenge of synthesizing long-range and diverse motions, which could not be fulfilled by existing auto-regressive models or path planning-based methods. We propose a hierarchical generation framework to solve this challenge. Specifically, our framework first generates a set of milestones and then synthesizes the motion along them. Therefore, the long-range motion generation could be reduced to synthesizing several short motion sequences guided by milestones. The experiments on the NSM, COUCH, and SAMP datasets show that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin in both quality and diversity.

**Title:** Tensor Programs VI: Feature Learning in Infinite-Depth Neural Networks  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02244  
**Abstract:** By classifying infinite-width neural networks and identifying the *optimal* limit, Tensor Programs IV and V demonstrated a universal way, called $\mu$P, for *widthwise hyperparameter transfer*, i.e., predicting optimal hyperparameters of wide neural networks from narrow ones. Here we investigate the analogous classification for *depthwise parametrizations* of deep residual networks (resnets). We classify depthwise parametrizations of block multiplier and learning rate by their infinite-width-then-depth limits. In resnets where each block has only one layer, we identify a unique optimal parametrization, called Depth-$\mu$P that extends $\mu$P and show empirically it admits depthwise hyperparameter transfer. We identify *feature diversity* as a crucial factor in deep networks, and Depth-$\mu$P can be characterized as maximizing both feature learning and feature diversity. Exploiting this, we find that absolute value, among all homogeneous nonlinearities, maximizes feature diversity and indeed empirically leads to significant better performance. However, if each block is deeper (such as modern transformers), then we find fundamental limitations in all possible infinite-depth limits of such parametrizations, which we illustrate both theoretically and empirically on simple networks as well as Megatron transformer trained on Common Crawl.

**Title:** Harnessing Pre-Trained Sentence Transformers for Offensive Language  Detection in Indian Languages  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02249  
**Abstract:** In our increasingly interconnected digital world, social media platforms have emerged as powerful channels for the dissemination of hate speech and offensive content. This work delves into the domain of hate speech detection, placing specific emphasis on three low-resource Indian languages: Bengali, Assamese, and Gujarati. The challenge is framed as a text classification task, aimed at discerning whether a tweet contains offensive or non-offensive content. Leveraging the HASOC 2023 datasets, we fine-tuned pre-trained BERT and SBERT models to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying hate speech. Our findings underscore the superiority of monolingual sentence-BERT models, particularly in the Bengali language, where we achieved the highest ranking. However, the performance in Assamese and Gujarati languages signifies ongoing opportunities for enhancement. Our goal is to foster inclusive online spaces by countering hate speech proliferation.

**Title:** MathVista: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning of Foundation Models in  Visual Contexts  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02255  
**Abstract:** Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive skills in various domains, their ability for mathematical reasoning within visual contexts has not been formally examined. Equipping LLMs and LMMs with this capability is vital for general-purpose AI assistants and showcases promising potential in education, data analysis, and scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we present MathVista, a benchmark designed to amalgamate challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks. We first taxonomize the key task types, reasoning skills, and visual contexts from the literature to guide our selection from 28 existing math-focused and visual question answering datasets. Then, we construct three new datasets, IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA, to accommodate for missing types of visual contexts. The problems featured often require deep visual understanding beyond OCR or image captioning, and compositional reasoning with rich domain-specific tools, thus posing a notable challenge to existing models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 11 prominent open-source and proprietary foundation models (LLMs, LLMs augmented with tools, and LMMs), and early experiments with GPT-4V. The best-performing model, Multimodal Bard, achieves only 58% of human performance (34.8% vs 60.3%), indicating ample room for further improvement. Given this significant gap, MathVista fuels future research in the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of tackling mathematically intensive and visually rich real-world tasks. Preliminary tests show that MathVista also presents challenges to GPT-4V, underscoring the benchmark's importance. The project is available at https://mathvista.github.io/.

**Title:** TransRadar: Adaptive-Directional Transformer for Real-Time Multi-View  Radar Semantic Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02260  
**Abstract:** Scene understanding plays an essential role in enabling autonomous driving and maintaining high standards of performance and safety. To address this task, cameras and laser scanners (LiDARs) have been the most commonly used sensors, with radars being less popular. Despite that, radars remain low-cost, information-dense, and fast-sensing techniques that are resistant to adverse weather conditions. While multiple works have been previously presented for radar-based scene semantic segmentation, the nature of the radar data still poses a challenge due to the inherent noise and sparsity, as well as the disproportionate foreground and background. In this work, we propose a novel approach to the semantic segmentation of radar scenes using a multi-input fusion of radar data through a novel architecture and loss functions that are tailored to tackle the drawbacks of radar perception. Our novel architecture includes an efficient attention block that adaptively captures important feature information. Our method, TransRadar, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CARRADA and RADIal datasets while having smaller model sizes. https://github.com/YahiDar/TransRadar

**Title:** Contrastive Post-training Large Language Models on Data Curriculum  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02263  
**Abstract:** Alignment serves as an important step to steer large language models (LLMs) towards human preferences. In this paper, we explore contrastive post-training techniques for alignment by automatically constructing preference pairs from multiple models of varying strengths (e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT and GPT-4). We carefully compare the contrastive techniques of SLiC and DPO to SFT baselines and find that DPO provides a step-function improvement even after continueing SFT saturates. We also explore a data curriculum learning scheme for contrastive post-training, which starts by learning from "easier" pairs and transitioning to "harder" ones, which further improves alignment. Finally, we scale up our experiments to train with more data and larger models like Orca. Remarkably, contrastive post-training further improves the performance of Orca, already a state-of-the-art instruction learning model tuned with GPT-4 outputs, to exceed that of ChatGPT.

**Title:** Gramian Angular Fields for leveraging pretrained computer vision models  with anomalous diffusion trajectories  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01416  
**Abstract:** Anomalous diffusion is present at all scales, from atomic to large scales. Some exemplary systems are; ultra-cold atoms, telomeres in the nucleus of cells, moisture transport in cement-based materials, the free movement of arthropods, and the migration patterns of birds. The characterization of the diffusion gives critical information about the dynamics of these systems and provides an interdisciplinary framework with which to study diffusive transport. Thus, the problem of identifying underlying diffusive regimes and inferring the anomalous diffusion exponent {$\alpha$} with high confidence is critical to physics, chemistry, biology, and ecology. Classification and analysis of raw trajectories combining machine learning techniques with statistics extracted from them have widely been studied in the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge ge (Munoz-Gil et al., 2021). Here we present a new data-driven method for working with diffusive trajectories. This method utilizes Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) to encode one-dimensional trajectories as images (Gramian Matrices), while preserving their spatiotemporal structure for input to computer-vision models. This allows us to leverage two well-established pre-trained computer-vision models, ResNet and MobileNet, to characterize the underlying diffusive regime, and infer the anomalous diffusion exponent {$\alpha$}. Short raw trajectories, of lengths between 10 and 50, are commonly encountered in single-particle tracking experiments and are the most difficult to characterize. We show that by using GAF images, we can outperform the current state-of-the-art while increasing accessibility to machine learning methods in an applied setting.

**Title:** Fetal-BET: Brain Extraction Tool for Fetal MRI  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01523  
**Abstract:** Fetal brain extraction is a necessary first step in most computational fetal brain MRI pipelines. However, it has been a very challenging task due to non-standard fetal head pose, fetal movements during examination, and vastly heterogeneous appearance of the developing fetal brain and the neighboring fetal and maternal anatomy across various sequences and scanning conditions. Development of a machine learning method to effectively address this task requires a large and rich labeled dataset that has not been previously available. As a result, there is currently no method for accurate fetal brain extraction on various fetal MRI sequences. In this work, we first built a large annotated dataset of approximately 72,000 2D fetal brain MRI images. Our dataset covers the three common MRI sequences including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and functional MRI acquired with different scanners. Moreover, it includes normal and pathological brains. Using this dataset, we developed and validated deep learning methods, by exploiting the power of the U-Net style architectures, the attention mechanism, multi-contrast feature learning, and data augmentation for fast, accurate, and generalizable automatic fetal brain extraction. Our approach leverages the rich information from multi-contrast (multi-sequence) fetal MRI data, enabling precise delineation of the fetal brain structures. Evaluations on independent test data show that our method achieves accurate brain extraction on heterogeneous test data acquired with different scanners, on pathological brains, and at various gestational stages. This robustness underscores the potential utility of our deep learning model for fetal brain imaging and image analysis.

**Title:** Score dynamics: scaling molecular dynamics with picosecond timesteps via  conditional diffusion model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01678  
**Abstract:** We propose score dynamics (SD), a general framework for learning effective evolution operators for atomistic as well as coarse-grained dynamics from molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. SD is centered around scores, or derivatives of the transition log-probability with respect to the dynamical degrees of freedom. The latter play the same role as force fields in MD but are used in denoising diffusion probability models to generate discrete transitions of the dynamical variables in an SD timestep, which can be orders of magnitude larger than a typical MD timestep. In this work, we construct graph neural network based score dynamics models of realistic molecular systems that are evolved with 1~ps timesteps. We demonstrate the efficacy of score dynamics with case studies of alanine dipeptide and short alkanes in aqueous solution. Both equilibrium predictions derived from the stationary distributions of the conditional probability and kinetic predictions for the transition rates and transition paths are in good agreement with MD at about 8-18 fold wall-clock speedup. Open challenges and possible future remedies to improve score dynamics are also discussed.

**Title:** Forecasting Tropical Cyclones with Cascaded Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01690  
**Abstract:** As cyclones become more intense due to climate change, the rise of AI-based modelling provides a more affordable and accessible approach compared to traditional methods based on mathematical models. This work leverages diffusion models to forecast cyclone trajectories and precipitation patterns by integrating satellite imaging, remote sensing, and atmospheric data, employing a cascaded approach that incorporates forecasting, super-resolution, and precipitation modelling, with training on a dataset of 51 cyclones from six major basins. Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts from the cascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout, with SSIM and PSNR values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks. This work also highlights the promising efficiency of AI methods such as diffusion models for high-performance needs, such as cyclone forecasting, while remaining computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable regions with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations.

**Title:** Backdiff: a diffusion model for generalized transferable protein  backmapping  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01768  
**Abstract:** Coarse-grained (CG) models play a crucial role in the study of protein structures, protein thermodynamic properties, and protein conformation dynamics. Due to the information loss in the coarse-graining process, backmapping from CG to all-atom configurations is essential in many protein design and drug discovery applications when detailed atomic representations are needed for in-depth studies. Despite recent progress in data-driven backmapping approaches, devising a backmapping method that can be universally applied across various CG models and proteins remains unresolved. In this work, we propose BackDiff, a new generative model designed to achieve generalization and reliability in the protein backmapping problem. BackDiff leverages the conditional score-based diffusion model with geometric representations. Since different CG models can contain different coarse-grained sites which include selected atoms (CG atoms) and simple CG auxiliary functions of atomistic coordinates (CG auxiliary variables), we design a self-supervised training framework to adapt to different CG atoms, and constrain the diffusion sampling paths with arbitrary CG auxiliary variables as conditions. Our method facilitates end-to-end training and allows efficient sampling across different proteins and diverse CG models without the need for retraining. Comprehensive experiments over multiple popular CG models demonstrate BackDiff's superior performance to existing state-of-the-art approaches, and generalization and flexibility that these approaches cannot achieve. A pretrained BackDiff model can offer a convenient yet reliable plug-and-play solution for protein researchers, enabling them to investigate further from their own CG models.

**Title:** SMRD: SURE-based Robust MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01799  
**Abstract:** Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for accelerated MRI reconstruction due to their high sample quality. They can effectively serve as rich data priors while incorporating the forward model flexibly at inference time, and they have been shown to be more robust than unrolled methods under distribution shifts. However, diffusion models require careful tuning of inference hyperparameters on a validation set and are still sensitive to distribution shifts during testing. To address these challenges, we introduce SURE-based MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion models (SMRD), a method that performs test-time hyperparameter tuning to enhance robustness during testing. SMRD uses Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to estimate the mean squared error of the reconstruction during testing. SURE is then used to automatically tune the inference hyperparameters and to set an early stopping criterion without the need for validation tuning. To the best of our knowledge, SMRD is the first to incorporate SURE into the sampling stage of diffusion models for automatic hyperparameter selection. SMRD outperforms diffusion model baselines on various measurement noise levels, acceleration factors, and anatomies, achieving a PSNR improvement of up to 6 dB under measurement noise. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/batuozt/SMRD .

**Title:** Synthetic CT Generation via Variant Invertible Network for All-digital  Brain PET Attenuation Correction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01885  
**Abstract:** Attenuation correction (AC) is essential for the generation of artifact-free and quantitatively accurate positron emission tomography (PET) images. However, AC of PET faces challenges including inter-scan motion and erroneous transformation of structural voxel-intensities to PET attenuation-correction factors. Nowadays, the problem of AC for quantitative PET have been solved to a large extent after the commercial availability of devices combining PET with computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, considering the feasibility of a deep learning approach for PET AC without anatomical imaging, this paper develops a PET AC method, which uses deep learning to generate continuously valued CT images from non-attenuation corrected PET images for AC on brain PET imaging. Specifically, an invertible network combined with the variable augmentation strategy that can achieve the bidirectional inference processes is proposed for synthetic CT generation (IVNAC). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted a comprehensive study on a total of 1440 data from 37 clinical patients using comparative algorithms (such as Cycle-GAN and Pix2pix). Perceptual analysis and quantitative evaluations illustrate that the invertible network for PET AC outperforms other existing AC models, which demonstrates the potential of the proposed method and the feasibility of achieving brain PET AC without CT.

**Title:** Generalized Schrödinger Bridge Matching  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02233  
**Abstract:** Modern distribution matching algorithms for training diffusion or flow models directly prescribe the time evolution of the marginal distributions between two boundary distributions. In this work, we consider a generalized distribution matching setup, where these marginals are only implicitly described as a solution to some task-specific objective function. The problem setup, known as the Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge (GSB), appears prevalently in many scientific areas both within and without machine learning. We propose Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (GSBM), a new matching algorithm inspired by recent advances, generalizing them beyond kinetic energy minimization and to account for task-specific state costs. We show that such a generalization can be cast as solving conditional stochastic optimal control, for which efficient variational approximations can be used, and further debiased with the aid of path integral theory. Compared to prior methods for solving GSB problems, our GSBM algorithm always preserves a feasible transport map between the boundary distributions throughout training, thereby enabling stable convergence and significantly improved scalability. We empirically validate our claims on an extensive suite of experimental setups, including crowd navigation, opinion depolarization, LiDAR manifolds, and image domain transfer. Our work brings new algorithmic opportunities for training diffusion models enhanced with task-specific optimality structures.
