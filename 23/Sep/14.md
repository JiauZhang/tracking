**Title:** Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Dialogue Analysis  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06490  
**Abstract:** Developing high-performing dialogue systems benefits from the automatic identification of undesirable behaviors in system responses. However, detecting such behaviors remains challenging, as it draws on a breadth of general knowledge and understanding of conversational practices. Although recent research has focused on building specialized classifiers for detecting specific dialogue behaviors, the behavior coverage is still incomplete and there is a lack of testing on real-world human-bot interactions. This paper investigates the ability of a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), ChatGPT-3.5, to perform dialogue behavior detection for nine categories in real human-bot dialogues. We aim to assess whether ChatGPT can match specialized models and approximate human performance, thereby reducing the cost of behavior detection tasks. Our findings reveal that neither specialized models nor ChatGPT have yet achieved satisfactory results for this task, falling short of human performance. Nevertheless, ChatGPT shows promising potential and often outperforms specialized detection models. We conclude with an in-depth examination of the prevalent shortcomings of ChatGPT, offering guidance for future research to enhance LLM capabilities.

**Title:** AGIBench: A Multi-granularity, Multimodal, Human-referenced,  Auto-scoring Benchmark for Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06495  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have revealed amazing intelligence. How to evaluate the question-solving abilities of LLMs and their degrees of intelligence is a hot-spot but challenging issue. First, the question-solving abilities are interlaced with different ability branches like understanding and massive knowledge categories like mathematics. Second, the inputs of questions are multimodal that may involve text and images. Third, the response format of LLMs is diverse and thus poses great challenges for result extraction and evaluation. In this paper, we propose AGIBench -- a multi-granularity, multimodal, human-referenced, and auto-scoring benchmarking methodology for LLMs. Instead of a collection of blended questions, AGIBench focuses on three typical ability branches and adopts a four-tuple <ability branch, knowledge, difficulty, modal> to label the attributes of each question. First, it supports multi-granularity benchmarking, e.g., per-question, per-ability branch, per-knowledge, per-modal, per-dataset, and per-difficulty level granularities. Second, it contains multimodal input, including text and images. Third, it classifies all the questions into five degrees of difficulty according to the average accuracy rate of abundant educated humans (human-referenced). Fourth, it adopts zero-shot learning to avoid introducing additional unpredictability and provides an auto-scoring method to extract and judge the result. Finally, it defines multi-dimensional metrics, including accuracy under the average, worst, best, and majority voting cases, and repeatability. AGIBench is publically available from \url{https://www.benchcouncil.org/agibench}.

**Title:** Leveraging Large Language Models and Weak Supervision for Social Media  data annotation: an evaluation using COVID-19 self-reported vaccination  tweets  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06503  
**Abstract:** The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges to the healthcare industry and society as a whole. With the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, social media platforms have become a popular medium for discussions on vaccine-related topics. Identifying vaccine-related tweets and analyzing them can provide valuable insights for public health research-ers and policymakers. However, manual annotation of a large number of tweets is time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we evaluate the usage of Large Language Models, in this case GPT-4 (March 23 version), and weak supervision, to identify COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets, with the purpose of comparing performance against human annotators. We leveraged a manu-ally curated gold-standard dataset and used GPT-4 to provide labels without any additional fine-tuning or instructing, in a single-shot mode (no additional prompting).

**Title:** DF-TransFusion: Multimodal Deepfake Detection via Lip-Audio  Cross-Attention and Facial Self-Attention  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06511  
**Abstract:** With the rise in manipulated media, deepfake detection has become an imperative task for preserving the authenticity of digital content. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal audio-video framework designed to concurrently process audio and video inputs for deepfake detection tasks. Our model capitalizes on lip synchronization with input audio through a cross-attention mechanism while extracting visual cues via a fine-tuned VGG-16 network. Subsequently, a transformer encoder network is employed to perform facial self-attention. We conduct multiple ablation studies highlighting different strengths of our approach. Our multi-modal methodology outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal deepfake detection techniques in terms of F-1 and per-video AUC scores.

**Title:** Overview of Memotion 3: Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of Codemixed  Hinglish Memes  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06517  
**Abstract:** Analyzing memes on the internet has emerged as a crucial endeavor due to the impact this multi-modal form of content wields in shaping online discourse. Memes have become a powerful tool for expressing emotions and sentiments, possibly even spreading hate and misinformation, through humor and sarcasm. In this paper, we present the overview of the Memotion 3 shared task, as part of the DeFactify 2 workshop at AAAI-23. The task released an annotated dataset of Hindi-English code-mixed memes based on their Sentiment (Task A), Emotion (Task B), and Emotion intensity (Task C). Each of these is defined as an individual task and the participants are ranked separately for each task. Over 50 teams registered for the shared task and 5 made final submissions to the test set of the Memotion 3 dataset. CLIP, BERT modifications, ViT etc. were the most popular models among the participants along with approaches such as Student-Teacher model, Fusion, and Ensembling. The best final F1 score for Task A is 34.41, Task B is 79.77 and Task C is 59.82.

**Title:** Exploring the Benefits of Differentially Private Pre-training and  Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning for Table Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06526  
**Abstract:** For machine learning with tabular data, Table Transformer (TabTransformer) is a state-of-the-art neural network model, while Differential Privacy (DP) is an essential component to ensure data privacy. In this paper, we explore the benefits of combining these two aspects together in the scenario of transfer learning -- differentially private pre-training and fine-tuning of TabTransformers with a variety of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, including Adapter, LoRA, and Prompt Tuning. Our extensive experiments on the ACSIncome dataset show that these PEFT methods outperform traditional approaches in terms of the accuracy of the downstream task and the number of trainable parameters, thus achieving an improved trade-off among parameter efficiency, privacy, and accuracy. Our code is available at github.com/IBM/DP-TabTransformer.

**Title:** Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning Framework for Session-based  Recommendations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06533  
**Abstract:** While session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have shown superior recommendation performance, multi-task learning (MTL) has been adopted by SBRSs to enhance their prediction accuracy and generalizability further. Hierarchical MTL (H-MTL) sets a hierarchical structure between prediction tasks and feeds outputs from auxiliary tasks to main tasks. This hierarchy leads to richer input features for main tasks and higher interpretability of predictions, compared to existing MTL frameworks. However, the H-MTL framework has not been investigated in SBRSs yet. In this paper, we propose HierSRec which incorporates the H-MTL architecture into SBRSs. HierSRec encodes a given session with a metadata-aware Transformer and performs next-category prediction (i.e., auxiliary task) with the session encoding. Next, HierSRec conducts next-item prediction (i.e., main task) with the category prediction result and session encoding. For scalable inference, HierSRec creates a compact set of candidate items (e.g., 4% of total items) per test example using the category prediction. Experiments show that HierSRec outperforms existing SBRSs as per next-item prediction accuracy on two session-based recommendation datasets. The accuracy of HierSRec measured with the carefully-curated candidate items aligns with the accuracy of HierSRec calculated with all items, which validates the usefulness of our candidate generation scheme via H-MTL.

**Title:** Text Encoders Lack Knowledge: Leveraging Generative LLMs for  Domain-Specific Semantic Textual Similarity  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06541  
**Abstract:** Amidst the sharp rise in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on various tasks, we find that semantic textual similarity (STS) has been under-explored. In this study, we show that STS can be cast as a text generation problem while maintaining strong performance on multiple STS benchmarks. Additionally, we show generative LLMs significantly outperform existing encoder-based STS models when characterizing the semantic similarity between two texts with complex semantic relationships dependent on world knowledge. We validate this claim by evaluating both generative LLMs and existing encoder-based STS models on three newly collected STS challenge sets which require world knowledge in the domains of Health, Politics, and Sports. All newly collected data is sourced from social media content posted after May 2023 to ensure the performance of closed-source models like ChatGPT cannot be credited to memorization. Our results show that, on average, generative LLMs outperform the best encoder-only baselines by an average of 22.3% on STS tasks requiring world knowledge. Our results suggest generative language models with STS-specific prompting strategies achieve state-of-the-art performance in complex, domain-specific STS tasks.

**Title:** Commands as AI Conversations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06551  
**Abstract:** Developers and data scientists often struggle to write command-line inputs, even though graphical interfaces or tools like ChatGPT can assist. The solution? "ai-cli," an open-source system inspired by GitHub Copilot that converts natural language prompts into executable commands for various Linux command-line tools. By tapping into OpenAI's API, which allows interaction through JSON HTTP requests, "ai-cli" transforms user queries into actionable command-line instructions. However, integrating AI assistance across multiple command-line tools, especially in open source settings, can be complex. Historically, operating systems could mediate, but individual tool functionality and the lack of a unified approach have made centralized integration challenging. The "ai-cli" tool, by bridging this gap through dynamic loading and linking with each program's Readline library API, makes command-line interfaces smarter and more user-friendly, opening avenues for further enhancement and cross-platform applicability.

**Title:** Offline Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Inverse Reinforcement  Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06553  
**Abstract:** The recent advances in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have achieved remarkable performance by leveraging human expertise. Yet, fully eliciting LLMs' potential for complex tasks requires navigating the vast search space of natural language prompts. While prompt engineering has shown promise, the requisite human-crafted prompts in trial-and-error attempts and the associated costs pose significant challenges. Crucially, the efficiency of prompt optimization hinges on the costly procedure of prompt evaluation. This work introduces Prompt-OIRL, an approach rooted in offline inverse reinforcement learning that seeks to bridge the gap between effective prompt evaluation and affordability. Our method draws on offline datasets from expert evaluations, employing Inverse-RL to derive a reward model for offline, query-dependent prompt evaluations. The advantages of Prompt-OIRL are manifold: it predicts prompt performance, is cost-efficient, produces human-readable results, and efficiently navigates the prompt space. We validate our method across four LLMs and three arithmetic datasets, highlighting its potential as a robust and effective tool for offline prompt evaluation and optimization. Our code as well as the offline datasets are released, and we highlight the Prompt-OIRL can be reproduced within a few hours using a single laptop using CPU

**Title:** Circle Feature Graphormer: Can Circle Features Stimulate Graph  Transformer?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06574  
**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce two local graph features for missing link prediction tasks on ogbl-citation2. We define the features as Circle Features, which are borrowed from the concept of circle of friends. We propose the detailed computing formulas for the above features. Firstly, we define the first circle feature as modified swing for common graph, which comes from bipartite graph. Secondly, we define the second circle feature as bridge, which indicates the importance of two nodes for different circle of friends. In addition, we firstly propose the above features as bias to enhance graph transformer neural network, such that graph self-attention mechanism can be improved. We implement a Circled Feature aware Graph transformer (CFG) model based on SIEG network, which utilizes a double tower structure to capture both global and local structure features. Experimental results show that CFG achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dataset ogbl-citation2.

**Title:** Can humans help BERT gain "confidence"?  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06580  
**Abstract:** The advancements in artificial intelligence over the last decade have opened a multitude of avenues for interdisciplinary research. Since the idea of artificial intelligence was inspired by the working of neurons in the brain, it seems pretty practical to combine the two fields and take the help of cognitive data to train AI models. Not only it will help to get a deeper understanding of the technology, but of the brain as well. In this thesis, I conduct novel experiments to integrate cognitive features from the Zurich Cognitive Corpus (ZuCo) (Hollenstein et al., 2018) with a transformer-based encoder model called BERT. I show how EEG and eye-tracking features from ZuCo can help to increase the performance of the NLP model. I confirm the performance increase with the help of a robustness-checking pipeline and derive a word-EEG lexicon to use in benchmarking on an external dataset that does not have any cognitive features associated with it. Further, I analyze the internal working mechanism of BERT and explore a potential method for model explainability by correlating it with a popular model-agnostic explainability framework called LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016). Finally, I discuss the possible directions to take this research forward.

**Title:** Zero-Shot Visual Classification with Guided Cropping  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06581  
**Abstract:** Pretrained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show promising zero-shot performance across a wide variety of datasets. For closed-set classification tasks, however, there is an inherent limitation: CLIP image encoders are typically designed to extract generic image-level features that summarize superfluous or confounding information for the target tasks. This results in degradation of classification performance, especially when objects of interest cover small areas of input images. In this work, we propose CLIP with Guided Cropping (GC-CLIP), where we use an off-the-shelf zero-shot object detection model in a preprocessing step to increase focus of zero-shot classifier to the object of interest and minimize influence of extraneous image regions. We empirically show that our approach improves zero-shot classification results across architectures and datasets, favorably for small objects.

**Title:** Reasoning with Latent Diffusion in Offline Reinforcement Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06599  
**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise as a means to learn high-reward policies from a static dataset, without the need for further environment interactions. However, a key challenge in offline RL lies in effectively stitching portions of suboptimal trajectories from the static dataset while avoiding extrapolation errors arising due to a lack of support in the dataset. Existing approaches use conservative methods that are tricky to tune and struggle with multi-modal data (as we show) or rely on noisy Monte Carlo return-to-go samples for reward conditioning. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the expressiveness of latent diffusion to model in-support trajectory sequences as compressed latent skills. This facilitates learning a Q-function while avoiding extrapolation error via batch-constraining. The latent space is also expressive and gracefully copes with multi-modal data. We show that the learned temporally-abstract latent space encodes richer task-specific information for offline RL tasks as compared to raw state-actions. This improves credit assignment and facilitates faster reward propagation during Q-learning. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmarks, particularly excelling in long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.

**Title:** ShaDocFormer: A Shadow-attentive Threshold Detector with Cascaded Fusion  Refiner for document shadow removal' to the ICASSP 2024 online submission  system  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06670  
**Abstract:** Document shadow is a common issue that arise when capturing documents using mobile devices, which significantly impacts the readability. Current methods encounter various challenges including inaccurate detection of shadow masks and estimation of illumination. In this paper, we propose ShaDocFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that integrates traditional methodologies and deep learning techniques to tackle the problem of document shadow removal. The ShaDocFormer architecture comprises two components: the Shadow-attentive Threshold Detector (STD) and the Cascaded Fusion Refiner (CFR). The STD module employs a traditional thresholding technique and leverages the attention mechanism of the Transformer to gather global information, thereby enabling precise detection of shadow masks. The cascaded and aggregative structure of the CFR module facilitates a coarse-to-fine restoration process for the entire image. As a result, ShaDocFormer excels in accurately detecting and capturing variations in both shadow and illumination, thereby enabling effective removal of shadows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaDocFormer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measurements.

**Title:** Attention-based Encoder-Decoder End-to-End Neural Diarization with  Embedding Enhancer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06672  
**Abstract:** Deep neural network-based systems have significantly improved the performance of speaker diarization tasks. However, end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) systems often struggle to generalize to scenarios with an unseen number of speakers, while target speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) systems tend to be overly complex. In this paper, we propose a simple attention-based encoder-decoder network for end-to-end neural diarization (AED-EEND). In our training process, we introduce a teacher-forcing strategy to address the speaker permutation problem, leading to faster model convergence. For evaluation, we propose an iterative decoding method that outputs diarization results for each speaker sequentially. Additionally, we propose an Enhancer module to enhance the frame-level speaker embeddings, enabling the model to handle scenarios with an unseen number of speakers. We also explore replacing the transformer encoder with a Conformer architecture, which better models local information. Furthermore, we discovered that commonly used simulation datasets for speaker diarization have a much higher overlap ratio compared to real data. We found that using simulated training data that is more consistent with real data can achieve an improvement in consistency. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies. Our best system achieved a new state-of-the-art diarization error rate (DER) performance on all the CALLHOME (10.08%), DIHARD II (24.64%), and AMI (13.00%) evaluation benchmarks, when no oracle voice activity detection (VAD) is used. Beyond speaker diarization, our AED-EEND system also shows remarkable competitiveness as a speech type detection model.

**Title:** Transparent Object Tracking with Enhanced Fusion Module  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06701  
**Abstract:** Accurate tracking of transparent objects, such as glasses, plays a critical role in many robotic tasks such as robot-assisted living. Due to the adaptive and often reflective texture of such objects, traditional tracking algorithms that rely on general-purpose learned features suffer from reduced performance. Recent research has proposed to instill transparency awareness into existing general object trackers by fusing purpose-built features. However, with the existing fusion techniques, the addition of new features causes a change in the latent space making it impossible to incorporate transparency awareness on trackers with fixed latent spaces. For example, many of the current days transformer-based trackers are fully pre-trained and are sensitive to any latent space perturbations. In this paper, we present a new feature fusion technique that integrates transparency information into a fixed feature space, enabling its use in a broader range of trackers. Our proposed fusion module, composed of a transformer encoder and an MLP module, leverages key query-based transformations to embed the transparency information into the tracking pipeline. We also present a new two-step training strategy for our fusion module to effectively merge transparency features. We propose a new tracker architecture that uses our fusion techniques to achieve superior results for transparent object tracking. Our proposed method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art trackers on TOTB, which is the largest transparent object tracking benchmark recently released. Our results and the implementation of code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/kalyan0510/TOTEM.

**Title:** TrafficGPT: Viewing, Processing and Interacting with Traffic Foundation  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06719  
**Abstract:** With the promotion of chatgpt to the public, Large language models indeed showcase remarkable common sense, reasoning, and planning skills, frequently providing insightful guidance. These capabilities hold significant promise for their application in urban traffic management and control. However, LLMs struggle with addressing traffic issues, especially processing numerical data and interacting with simulations, limiting their potential in solving traffic-related challenges. In parallel, specialized traffic foundation models exist but are typically designed for specific tasks with limited input-output interactions. Combining these models with LLMs presents an opportunity to enhance their capacity for tackling complex traffic-related problems and providing insightful suggestions. To bridge this gap, we present TrafficGPT, a fusion of ChatGPT and traffic foundation models. This integration yields the following key enhancements: 1) empowering ChatGPT with the capacity to view, analyze, process traffic data, and provide insightful decision support for urban transportation system management; 2) facilitating the intelligent deconstruction of broad and complex tasks and sequential utilization of traffic foundation models for their gradual completion; 3) aiding human decision-making in traffic control through natural language dialogues; and 4) enabling interactive feedback and solicitation of revised outcomes. By seamlessly intertwining large language model and traffic expertise, TrafficGPT not only advances traffic management but also offers a novel approach to leveraging AI capabilities in this domain. The TrafficGPT demo can be found in https://github.com/lijlansg/TrafficGPT.git.

**Title:** Dynamic Spectrum Mixer for Visual Recognition  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06721  
**Abstract:** Recently, MLP-based vision backbones have achieved promising performance in several visual recognition tasks. However, the existing MLP-based methods directly aggregate tokens with static weights, leaving the adaptability to different images untouched. Moreover, Recent research demonstrates that MLP-Transformer is great at creating long-range dependencies but ineffective at catching high frequencies that primarily transmit local information, which prevents it from applying to the downstream dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a content-adaptive yet computationally efficient structure, dubbed Dynamic Spectrum Mixer (DSM). The DSM represents token interactions in the frequency domain by employing the Discrete Cosine Transform, which can learn long-term spatial dependencies with log-linear complexity. Furthermore, a dynamic spectrum weight generation layer is proposed as the spectrum bands selector, which could emphasize the informative frequency bands while diminishing others. To this end, the technique can efficiently learn detailed features from visual input that contains both high- and low-frequency information. Extensive experiments show that DSM is a powerful and adaptable backbone for a range of visual recognition tasks. Particularly, DSM outperforms previous transformer-based and MLP-based models, on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, such as 83.8 \% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, and 49.9 \% mIoU on ADE20K.

**Title:** Integrating GAN and Texture Synthesis for Enhanced Road Damage Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06747  
**Abstract:** In the domain of traffic safety and road maintenance, precise detection of road damage is crucial for ensuring safe driving and prolonging road durability. However, current methods often fall short due to limited data. Prior attempts have used Generative Adversarial Networks to generate damage with diverse shapes and manually integrate it into appropriate positions. However, the problem has not been well explored and is faced with two challenges. First, they only enrich the location and shape of damage while neglect the diversity of severity levels, and the realism still needs further improvement. Second, they require a significant amount of manual effort. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach. In addition to using GAN to generate damage with various shapes, we further employ texture synthesis techniques to extract road textures. These two elements are then mixed with different weights, allowing us to control the severity of the synthesized damage, which are then embedded back into the original images via Poisson blending. Our method ensures both richness of damage severity and a better alignment with the background. To save labor costs, we leverage structural similarity for automated sample selection during embedding. Each augmented data of an original image contains versions with varying severity levels. We implement a straightforward screening strategy to mitigate distribution drift. Experiments are conducted on a public road damage dataset. The proposed method not only eliminates the need for manual labor but also achieves remarkable enhancements, improving the mAP by 4.1% and the F1-score by 4.5%.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06787  
**Abstract:** In the Text-to-speech(TTS) task, the latent diffusion model has excellent fidelity and generalization, but its expensive resource consumption and slow inference speed have always been a challenging. This paper proposes Discrete Diffusion Model with Contrastive Learning for Text-to-Speech Generation(DCTTS). The following contributions are made by DCTTS: 1) The TTS diffusion model based on discrete space significantly lowers the computational consumption of the diffusion model and improves sampling speed; 2) The contrastive learning method based on discrete space is used to enhance the alignment connection between speech and text and improve sampling quality; and 3) It uses an efficient text encoder to simplify the model's parameters and increase computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach proposed in this paper has outstanding speech synthesis quality and sampling speed while significantly reducing the resource consumption of diffusion model.

**Title:** TAP: Targeted Prompting for Task Adaptive Generation of Textual Training  Instances for Visual Classification  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06809  
**Abstract:** Vision and Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have enabled visual recognition of a potentially unlimited set of categories described by text prompts. However, for the best visual recognition performance, these models still require tuning to better fit the data distributions of the downstream tasks, in order to overcome the domain shift from the web-based pre-training data. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to effectively tune VLMs without any paired data, and in particular to effectively improve VLMs visual recognition performance using text-only training data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we dive deeper into this exciting text-only VLM training approach and explore ways it can be significantly further improved taking the specifics of the downstream task into account when sampling text data from LLMs. In particular, compared to the SOTA text-only VLM training approach, we demonstrate up to 8.4% performance improvement in (cross) domain-specific adaptation, up to 8.7% improvement in fine-grained recognition, and 3.1% overall average improvement in zero-shot classification compared to strong baselines.

**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06844  
**Abstract:** The wide-spread use of social networks has given rise to subjective, misleading, and even false information on the Internet. Thus, subjectivity detection can play an important role in ensuring the objectiveness and the quality of a piece of information. This paper presents the solution built by the Gpachov team for the CLEF-2023 CheckThat! lab Task~2 on subjectivity detection. Three different research directions are explored. The first one is based on fine-tuning a sentence embeddings encoder model and dimensionality reduction. The second one explores a sample-efficient few-shot learning model. The third one evaluates fine-tuning a multilingual transformer on an altered dataset, using data from multiple languages. Finally, the three approaches are combined in a simple majority voting ensemble, resulting in 0.77 macro F1 on the test set and achieving 2nd place on the English subtask.

**Title:** MagiCapture: High-Resolution Multi-Concept Portrait Customization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06895  
**Abstract:** Large-scale text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion are capable of generating high-fidelity photorealistic portrait images. There is an active research area dedicated to personalizing these models, aiming to synthesize specific subjects or styles using provided sets of reference images. However, despite the plausible results from these personalization methods, they tend to produce images that often fall short of realism and are not yet on a commercially viable level. This is particularly noticeable in portrait image generation, where any unnatural artifact in human faces is easily discernible due to our inherent human bias. To address this, we introduce MagiCapture, a personalization method for integrating subject and style concepts to generate high-resolution portrait images using just a few subject and style references. For instance, given a handful of random selfies, our fine-tuned model can generate high-quality portrait images in specific styles, such as passport or profile photos. The main challenge with this task is the absence of ground truth for the composed concepts, leading to a reduction in the quality of the final output and an identity shift of the source subject. To address these issues, we present a novel Attention Refocusing loss coupled with auxiliary priors, both of which facilitate robust learning within this weakly supervised learning setting. Our pipeline also includes additional post-processing steps to ensure the creation of highly realistic outputs. MagiCapture outperforms other baselines in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations and can also be generalized to other non-human objects.

**Title:** Native Language Identification with Big Bird Embeddings  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06923  
**Abstract:** Native Language Identification (NLI) intends to classify an author's native language based on their writing in another language. Historically, the task has heavily relied on time-consuming linguistic feature engineering, and transformer-based NLI models have thus far failed to offer effective, practical alternatives. The current work investigates if input size is a limiting factor, and shows that classifiers trained using Big Bird embeddings outperform linguistic feature engineering models by a large margin on the Reddit-L2 dataset. Additionally, we provide further insight into input length dependencies, show consistent out-of-sample performance, and qualitatively analyze the embedding space. Given the effectiveness and computational efficiency of this method, we believe it offers a promising avenue for future NLI work.

**Title:** Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model for Dialogue Emotion Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06928  
**Abstract:** Emotion detection is a critical technology extensively employed in diverse fields. While the incorporation of commonsense knowledge has proven beneficial for existing emotion detection methods, dialogue-based emotion detection encounters numerous difficulties and challenges due to human agency and the variability of dialogue content.In dialogues, human emotions tend to accumulate in bursts. However, they are often implicitly expressed. This implies that many genuine emotions remain concealed within a plethora of unrelated words and dialogues.In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model based on hidden variable separation, which is founded on the separation of hidden variables. This model effectively decomposes the content of dialogues and investigates the temporal accumulation of emotions, thereby enabling more precise emotion recognition. First, we introduce a novel Causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to establish the correlation between hidden emotional information and other observed elements. Subsequently, our approach utilizes pre-extracted personal attributes and utterance topics as guiding factors for the distribution of hidden variables, aiming to separate irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose a dynamic temporal disentanglement model to infer the propagation of utterances and hidden variables, enabling the accumulation of emotion-related information throughout the conversation. To guide this disentanglement process, we leverage the ChatGPT-4.0 and LSTM networks to extract utterance topics and personal attributes as observed information.Finally, we test our approach on two popular datasets in dialogue emotion detection and relevant experimental results verified the model's superiority.

**Abstract:** Recent progresses in large-scale text-to-image models have yielded remarkable accomplishments, finding various applications in art domain. However, expressing unique characteristics of an artwork (e.g. brushwork, colortone, or composition) with text prompts alone may encounter limitations due to the inherent constraints of verbal description. To this end, we introduce DreamStyler, a novel framework designed for artistic image synthesis, proficient in both text-to-image synthesis and style transfer. DreamStyler optimizes a multi-stage textual embedding with a context-aware text prompt, resulting in prominent image quality. In addition, with content and style guidance, DreamStyler exhibits flexibility to accommodate a range of style references. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance across multiple scenarios, suggesting its promising potential in artistic product creation.

**Title:** DEFormer: DCT-driven Enhancement Transformer for Low-light Image and  Dark Vision  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06941  
**Abstract:** The goal of low-light image enhancement is to restore the color and details of the image and is of great significance for high-level visual tasks in autonomous driving. However, it is difficult to restore the lost details in the dark area by relying only on the RGB domain. In this paper we introduce frequency as a new clue into the network and propose a novel DCT-driven enhancement transformer (DEFormer). First, we propose a learnable frequency branch (LFB) for frequency enhancement contains DCT processing and curvature-based frequency enhancement (CFE). CFE calculates the curvature of each channel to represent the detail richness of different frequency bands, then we divides the frequency features, which focuses on frequency bands with richer textures. In addition, we propose a cross domain fusion (CDF) for reducing the differences between the RGB domain and the frequency domain. We also adopt DEFormer as a preprocessing in dark detection, DEFormer effectively improves the performance of the detector, bringing 2.1% and 3.4% improvement in ExDark and DARK FACE datasets on mAP respectively.

**Title:** Neural network-based coronary dominance classification of RCA angiograms  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06958  
**Abstract:** Background. Cardiac dominance classification is essential for SYNTAX score estimation, which is a tool used to determine the complexity of coronary artery disease and guide patient selection toward optimal revascularization strategy. Objectives. Cardiac dominance classification algorithm based on the analysis of right coronary artery (RCA) angiograms using neural network Method. We employed convolutional neural network ConvNext and Swin transformer for 2D image (frames) classification, along with a majority vote for cardio angiographic view classification. An auxiliary network was also used to detect irrelevant images which were then excluded from the data set. Our data set consisted of 828 angiographic studies, 192 of them being patients with left dominance. Results. 5-fold cross validation gave the following dominance classification metrics (p=95%): macro recall=93.1%, accuracy=93.5%, macro F1=89.2%. The most common case in which the model regularly failed was RCA occlusion, as it requires utilization of LCA information. Another cause for false prediction is a small diameter combined with poor quality cardio angiographic view. In such cases, cardiac dominance classification can be complex and may require discussion among specialists to reach an accurate conclusion. Conclusion. The use of machine learning approaches to classify cardiac dominance based on RCA alone has been shown to be successful with satisfactory accuracy. However, for higher accuracy, it is necessary to utilize LCA information in the case of an occluded RCA and detect cases where there is high uncertainty.

**Title:** OYXOY: A Modern NLP Test Suite for Modern Greek  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07009  
**Abstract:** This paper serves as a foundational step towards the development of a linguistically motivated and technically relevant evaluation suite for Greek NLP. We initiate this endeavor by introducing four expert-verified evaluation tasks, specifically targeted at natural language inference, word sense disambiguation (through example comparison or sense selection) and metaphor detection. More than language-adapted replicas of existing tasks, we contribute two innovations which will resonate with the broader resource and evaluation community. Firstly, our inference dataset is the first of its kind, marking not just \textit{one}, but rather \textit{all} possible inference labels, accounting for possible shifts due to e.g. ambiguity or polysemy. Secondly, we demonstrate a cost-efficient method to obtain datasets for under-resourced languages. Using ChatGPT as a language-neutral parser, we transform the Dictionary of Standard Modern Greek into a structured format, from which we derive the other three tasks through simple projections. Alongside each task, we conduct experiments using currently available state of the art machinery. Our experimental baselines affirm the challenging nature of our tasks and highlight the need for expedited progress in order for the Greek NLP ecosystem to keep pace with contemporary mainstream research.

**Title:** SafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Large Language Models with  Multiple Choice Questions  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07045  
**Abstract:** With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), increasing attention has been paid to their safety concerns. Consequently, evaluating the safety of LLMs has become an essential task for facilitating the broad applications of LLMs. Nevertheless, the absence of comprehensive safety evaluation benchmarks poses a significant impediment to effectively assess and enhance the safety of LLMs. In this work, we present SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety of LLMs, which comprises 11,435 diverse multiple choice questions spanning across 7 distinct categories of safety concerns. Notably, SafetyBench also incorporates both Chinese and English data, facilitating the evaluation in both languages. Our extensive tests over 25 popular Chinese and English LLMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal a substantial performance advantage for GPT-4 over its counterparts, and there is still significant room for improving the safety of current LLMs. We believe SafetyBench will enable fast and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' safety, and foster the development of safer LLMs. Data and evaluation guidelines are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SafetyBench.

**Title:** UnifiedGesture: A Unified Gesture Synthesis Model for Multiple Skeletons  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07051  
**Abstract:** The automatic co-speech gesture generation draws much attention in computer animation. Previous works designed network structures on individual datasets, which resulted in a lack of data volume and generalizability across different motion capture standards. In addition, it is a challenging task due to the weak correlation between speech and gestures. To address these problems, we present UnifiedGesture, a novel diffusion model-based speech-driven gesture synthesis approach, trained on multiple gesture datasets with different skeletons. Specifically, we first present a retargeting network to learn latent homeomorphic graphs for different motion capture standards, unifying the representations of various gestures while extending the dataset. We then capture the correlation between speech and gestures based on a diffusion model architecture using cross-local attention and self-attention to generate better speech-matched and realistic gestures. To further align speech and gesture and increase diversity, we incorporate reinforcement learning on the discrete gesture units with a learned reward function. Extensive experiments show that UnifiedGesture outperforms recent approaches on speech-driven gesture generation in terms of CCA, FGD, and human-likeness. All code, pre-trained models, databases, and demos are available to the public at https://github.com/YoungSeng/UnifiedGesture.

**Title:** Aggregating Long-term Sharp Features via Hybrid Transformers for Video  Deblurring  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07054  
**Abstract:** Video deblurring methods, aiming at recovering consecutive sharp frames from a given blurry video, usually assume that the input video suffers from consecutively blurry frames. However, in real-world blurry videos taken by modern imaging devices, sharp frames usually appear in the given video, thus making temporal long-term sharp features available for facilitating the restoration of a blurry frame. In this work, we propose a video deblurring method that leverages both neighboring frames and present sharp frames using hybrid Transformers for feature aggregation. Specifically, we first train a blur-aware detector to distinguish between sharp and blurry frames. Then, a window-based local Transformer is employed for exploiting features from neighboring frames, where cross attention is beneficial for aggregating features from neighboring frames without explicit spatial alignment. To aggregate long-term sharp features from detected sharp frames, we utilize a global Transformer with multi-scale matching capability. Moreover, our method can easily be extended to event-driven video deblurring by incorporating an event fusion module into the global Transformer. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art video deblurring methods as well as event-driven video deblurring methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality.

**Title:** Large Language Models for Compiler Optimization  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07062  
**Abstract:** We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model and improve the model's depth of understanding.

**Title:** Comparing Llama-2 and GPT-3 LLMs for HPC kernels generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07103  
**Abstract:** We evaluate the use of the open-source Llama-2 model for generating well-known, high-performance computing kernels (e.g., AXPY, GEMV, GEMM) on different parallel programming models and languages (e.g., C++: OpenMP, OpenMP Offload, OpenACC, CUDA, HIP; Fortran: OpenMP, OpenMP Offload, OpenACC; Python: numpy, Numba, pyCUDA, cuPy; and Julia: Threads, CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl). We built upon our previous work that is based on the OpenAI Codex, which is a descendant of GPT-3, to generate similar kernels with simple prompts via GitHub Copilot. Our goal is to compare the accuracy of Llama-2 and our original GPT-3 baseline by using a similar metric. Llama-2 has a simplified model that shows competitive or even superior accuracy. We also report on the differences between these foundational large language models as generative AI continues to redefine human-computer interactions. Overall, Copilot generates codes that are more reliable but less optimized, whereas codes generated by Llama-2 are less reliable but more optimized when correct.

**Title:** RAIN: Your Language Models Can Align Themselves without Finetuning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07124  
**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide backward rewind and forward generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates; during the self-evaluation phase, the model receives guidance on which human preference to align with through a fixed-template prompt, eliminating the need to modify the initial prompt. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B over vanilla inference from 82% to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. Under the leading adversarial attack llm-attacks on Vicuna 33B, RAIN establishes a new defense baseline by reducing the attack success rate from 94% to 19%.

**Title:** Text-Guided Generation and Editing of Compositional 3D Avatars  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07125  
**Abstract:** Our goal is to create a realistic 3D facial avatar with hair and accessories using only a text description. While this challenge has attracted significant recent interest, existing methods either lack realism, produce unrealistic shapes, or do not support editing, such as modifications to the hairstyle. We argue that existing methods are limited because they employ a monolithic modeling approach, using a single representation for the head, face, hair, and accessories. Our observation is that the hair and face, for example, have very different structural qualities that benefit from different representations. Building on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in which the head, face, and upper body are represented with traditional 3D meshes, and the hair, clothing, and accessories with neural radiance fields (NeRF). The model-based mesh representation provides a strong geometric prior for the face region, improving realism while enabling editing of the person's appearance. By using NeRFs to represent the remaining components, our method is able to model and synthesize parts with complex geometry and appearance, such as curly hair and fluffy scarves. Our novel system synthesizes these high-quality compositional avatars from text descriptions. The experimental results demonstrate that our method, Text-guided generation and Editing of Compositional Avatars (TECA), produces avatars that are more realistic than those of recent methods while being editable because of their compositional nature. For example, our TECA enables the seamless transfer of compositional features like hairstyles, scarves, and other accessories between avatars. This capability supports applications such as virtual try-on.

**Title:** On the Contraction Coefficient of the Schrödinger Bridge for  Stochastic Linear Systems  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06622  
**Abstract:** Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is a stochastic optimal control problem to steer a given initial state density to another, subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. A popular method to numerically solve the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problems, in both classical and in the linear system settings, is via contractive fixed point recursions. These recursions can be seen as dynamic versions of the well-known Sinkhorn iterations, and under mild assumptions, they solve the so-called Schr\"{o}dinger systems with guaranteed linear convergence. In this work, we study a priori estimates for the contraction coefficients associated with the convergence of respective Schr\"{o}dinger systems. We provide new geometric and control-theoretic interpretations for the same. Building on these newfound interpretations, we point out the possibility of improved computation for the worst-case contraction coefficients of linear SBPs by preconditioning the endpoint support sets.

**Title:** Adapt and Diffuse: Sample-adaptive Reconstruction via Latent Diffusion  Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06642  
**Abstract:** Inverse problems arise in a multitude of applications, where the goal is to recover a clean signal from noisy and possibly (non)linear observations. The difficulty of a reconstruction problem depends on multiple factors, such as the structure of the ground truth signal, the severity of the degradation, the implicit bias of the reconstruction model and the complex interactions between the above factors. This results in natural sample-by-sample variation in the difficulty of a reconstruction task, which is often overlooked by contemporary techniques. Recently, diffusion-based inverse problem solvers have established new state-of-the-art in various reconstruction tasks. However, they have the drawback of being computationally prohibitive. Our key observation in this paper is that most existing solvers lack the ability to adapt their compute power to the difficulty of the reconstruction task, resulting in long inference times, subpar performance and wasteful resource allocation. We propose a novel method that we call severity encoding, to estimate the degradation severity of noisy, degraded signals in the latent space of an autoencoder. We show that the estimated severity has strong correlation with the true corruption level and can give useful hints at the difficulty of reconstruction problems on a sample-by-sample basis. Furthermore, we propose a reconstruction method based on latent diffusion models that leverages the predicted degradation severities to fine-tune the reverse diffusion sampling trajectory and thus achieve sample-adaptive inference times. We utilize latent diffusion posterior sampling to maintain data consistency with observations. We perform experiments on both linear and nonlinear inverse problems and demonstrate that our technique achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based techniques, with significant improvements in computational efficiency.

**Title:** Generalizable improvement of the Spalart-Allmaras model through  assimilation of experimental data  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06679  
**Abstract:** This study focuses on the use of model and data fusion for improving the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions of separated flows. In particular, our goal is to develop of models that not-only assimilate sparse experimental data to improve performance in computational models, but also generalize to unseen cases by recovering classical SA behavior. We achieve our goals using data assimilation, namely the Ensemble Kalman Filtering approach (EnKF), to calibrate the coefficients of the SA model for separated flows. A holistic calibration strategy is implemented via a parameterization of the production, diffusion, and destruction terms. This calibration relies on the assimilation of experimental data collected velocity profiles, skin friction, and pressure coefficients for separated flows. Despite using of observational data from a single flow condition around a backward-facing step (BFS), the recalibrated SA model demonstrates generalization to other separated flows, including cases such as the 2D-bump and modified BFS. Significant improvement is observed in the quantities of interest, i.e., skin friction coefficient ($C_f$) and pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for each flow tested. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the newly proposed model recovers SA proficiency for external, unseparated flows, such as flow around a NACA-0012 airfoil without any danger of extrapolation, and that the individually calibrated terms in the SA model are targeted towards specific flow-physics wherein the calibrated production term improves the re-circulation zone while destruction improves the recovery zone.

**Title:** Scalable neural network models and terascale datasets for particle-flow  reconstruction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06782  
**Abstract:** We study scalable machine learning models for full event reconstruction in high-energy electron-positron collisions based on a highly granular detector simulation. Particle-flow (PF) reconstruction can be formulated as a supervised learning task using tracks and calorimeter clusters or hits. We compare a graph neural network and kernel-based transformer and demonstrate that both avoid quadratic memory allocation and computational cost while achieving realistic PF reconstruction. We show that hyperparameter tuning on a supercomputer significantly improves the physics performance of the models. We also demonstrate that the resulting model is highly portable across hardware processors, supporting Nvidia, AMD, and Intel Habana cards. Finally, we demonstrate that the model can be trained on highly granular inputs consisting of tracks and calorimeter hits, resulting in a competitive physics performance with the baseline. Datasets and software to reproduce the studies are published following the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles.

**Title:** VRDMG: Vocal Restoration via Diffusion Posterior Sampling with Multiple  Guidance  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06934  
**Abstract:** Restoring degraded music signals is essential to enhance audio quality for downstream music manipulation. Recent diffusion-based music restoration methods have demonstrated impressive performance, and among them, diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) stands out given its intrinsic properties, making it versatile across various restoration tasks. In this paper, we identify that there are potential issues which will degrade current DPS-based methods' performance and introduce the way to mitigate the issues inspired by diverse diffusion guidance techniques including the RePaint (RP) strategy and the Pseudoinverse-Guided Diffusion Models ($\Pi$GDM). We demonstrate our methods for the vocal declipping and bandwidth extension tasks under various levels of distortion and cutoff frequency, respectively. In both tasks, our methods outperform the current DPS-based music restoration benchmarks. We refer to \url{
