### Post-training Quantization on Diffusion Models
Denoising diffusion (score-based) generative models have recently achieved significant accomplishments in generating realistic and diverse data. These approaches define a forward diffusion process for transforming data into noise and a backward denoising process for sampling data from noise. Unfortunately, the generation process of current denoising diffusion models is notoriously slow due to the lengthy iterative noise estimations, which rely on cumbersome neural networks. It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed, especially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of diffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories. However, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in every iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of compressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining DMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce post-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output distributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making previous PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step scenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three aspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric. We summarize and use several observations derived from all-inclusive investigations to formulate our method, which especially targets the unique multi-time-step structure of DMs. Experimentally, our method can directly quantize full-precision DMs into 8-bit models while maintaining or even improving their performance in a training-free manner. Importantly, our method can serve as a plug-and-play module on other fast-sampling methods, e.g., DDIM. 

### Superpoint Transformer for 3D Scene Instance Segmentation
Most existing methods realize 3D instance segmentation by extending those models used for 3D object detection or 3D semantic segmentation. However, these non-straightforward methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) Imprecise bounding boxes or unsatisfactory semantic predictions limit the performance of the overall 3D instance segmentation framework. 2) Existing method requires a time-consuming intermediate step of aggregation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end 3D instance segmentation method based on Superpoint Transformer, named as SPFormer. It groups potential features from point clouds into superpoints, and directly predicts instances through query vectors without relying on the results of object detection or semantic segmentation. The key step in this framework is a novel query decoder with transformers that can capture the instance information through the superpoint cross-attention mechanism and generate the superpoint masks of the instances. Through bipartite matching based on superpoint masks, SPFormer can implement the network training without the intermediate aggregation step, which accelerates the network. Extensive experiments on ScanNetv2 and S3DIS benchmarks verify that our method is concise yet efficient. Notably, SPFormer exceeds compared state-of-the-art methods by 4.3% on ScanNetv2 hidden test set in terms of mAP and keeps fast inference speed (247ms per frame) simultaneously. Code is available at https://github.com/sunjiahao1999/SPFormer. 

### Kinematic-aware Hierarchical Attention Network for Human Pose Estimation  in Videos
Previous video-based human pose estimation methods have shown promising results by leveraging aggregated features of consecutive frames. However, most approaches compromise accuracy to mitigate jitter or do not sufficiently comprehend the temporal aspects of human motion. Furthermore, occlusion increases uncertainty between consecutive frames, which results in unsmooth results. To address these issues, we design an architecture that exploits the keypoint kinematic features with the following components. First, we effectively capture the temporal features by leveraging individual keypoint's velocity and acceleration. Second, the proposed hierarchical transformer encoder aggregates spatio-temporal dependencies and refines the 2D or 3D input pose estimated from existing estimators. Finally, we provide an online cross-supervision between the refined input pose generated from the encoder and the final pose from our decoder to enable joint optimization. We demonstrate comprehensive results and validate the effectiveness of our model in various tasks: 2D pose estimation, 3D pose estimation, body mesh recovery, and sparsely annotated multi-human pose estimation. Our code is available at https://github.com/KyungMinJin/HANet.

### Balanced Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network for Damage  Assessment from Low-Data Imbalanced-Class Regime
In recent years, applying deep learning (DL) to assess structural damages has gained growing popularity in vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM). However, both data deficiency and class-imbalance hinder the wide adoption of DL in practical applications of SHM. Common mitigation strategies include transfer learning, over-sampling, and under-sampling, yet these ad-hoc methods only provide limited performance boost that varies from one case to another. In this work, we introduce one variant of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named the balanced semi-supervised GAN (BSS-GAN). It adopts the semi-supervised learning concept and applies balanced-batch sampling in training to resolve low-data and imbalanced-class problems. A series of computer experiments on concrete cracking and spalling classification were conducted under the low-data imbalanced-class regime with limited computing power. The results show that the BSS-GAN is able to achieve better damage detection in terms of recall and $F_\beta$ score than other conventional methods, indicating its state-of-the-art performance. 

### One is All: Bridging the Gap Between Neural Radiance Fields  Architectures with Progressive Volume Distillation
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods have proved effective as compact, high-quality and versatile representations for 3D scenes, and enable downstream tasks such as editing, retrieval, navigation, etc. Various neural architectures are vying for the core structure of NeRF, including the plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), sparse tensors, low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. Each of these representations has its particular set of trade-offs. For example, the hashtable-based representations admit faster training and rendering but their lack of clear geometric meaning hampers downstream tasks like spatial-relation-aware editing. In this paper, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation (PVD), a systematic distillation method that allows any-to-any conversions between different architectures, including MLP, sparse or low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. PVD consequently empowers downstream applications to optimally adapt the neural representations for the task at hand in a post hoc fashion. The conversions are fast, as distillation is progressively performed on different levels of volume representations, from shallower to deeper. We also employ special treatment of density to deal with its specific numerical instability problem. Empirical evidence is presented to validate our method on the NeRF-Synthetic, LLFF and TanksAndTemples datasets. For example, with PVD, an MLP-based NeRF model can be distilled from a hashtable-based Instant-NGP model at a 10X~20X faster speed than being trained the original NeRF from scratch, while achieving a superior level of synthesis quality. Code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/AAAI2023-PVD. 

### UDE: A Unified Driving Engine for Human Motion Generation
Generating controllable and editable human motion sequences is a key challenge in 3D Avatar generation. It has been labor-intensive to generate and animate human motion for a long time until learning-based approaches have been developed and applied recently. However, these approaches are still task-specific or modality-specific\cite {ahuja2019language2pose}\cite{ghosh2021synthesis}\cite{ferreira2021learning}\cite{li2021ai}. In this paper, we propose ``UDE", the first unified driving engine that enables generating human motion sequences from natural language or audio sequences (see Fig.~\ref{fig:teaser}). Specifically, UDE consists of the following key components: 1) a motion quantization module based on VQVAE that represents continuous motion sequence as discrete latent code\cite{van2017neural}, 2) a modality-agnostic transformer encoder\cite{vaswani2017attention} that learns to map modality-aware driving signals to a joint space, and 3) a unified token transformer (GPT-like\cite{radford2019language}) network to predict the quantized latent code index in an auto-regressive manner. 4) a diffusion motion decoder that takes as input the motion tokens and decodes them into motion sequences with high diversity. We evaluate our method on HumanML3D\cite{Guo_2022_CVPR} and AIST++\cite{li2021learn} benchmarks, and the experiment results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Dimensionality-Varying Diffusion Process
Diffusion models, which learn to reverse a signal destruction process to generate new data, typically require the signal at each step to have the same dimension. We argue that, considering the spatial redundancy in image signals, there is no need to maintain a high dimensionality in the evolution process, especially in the early generation phase. To this end, we make a theoretical generalization of the forward diffusion process via signal decomposition. Concretely, we manage to decompose an image into multiple orthogonal components and control the attenuation of each component when perturbing the image. That way, along with the noise strength increasing, we are able to diminish those inconsequential components and thus use a lower-dimensional signal to represent the source, barely losing information. Such a reformulation allows to vary dimensions in both training and inference of diffusion models. Extensive experiments on a range of datasets suggest that our approach substantially reduces the computational cost and achieves on-par or even better synthesis performance compared to baseline methods. We also show that our strategy facilitates high-resolution image synthesis and improves FID of diffusion model trained on FFHQ at $1024\times1024$ resolution from 52.40 to 10.46. Code and models will be made publicly available. 

### NoisyQuant: Noisy Bias-Enhanced Post-Training Activation Quantization  for Vision Transformers
The complicated architecture and high training cost of vision transformers urge the exploration of post-training quantization. However, the heavy-tailed distribution of vision transformer activations hinders the effectiveness of previous post-training quantization methods, even with advanced quantizer designs. Instead of tuning the quantizer to better fit the complicated activation distribution, this paper proposes NoisyQuant, a quantizer-agnostic enhancement for the post-training activation quantization performance of vision transformers. We make a surprising theoretical discovery that for a given quantizer, adding a fixed Uniform noisy bias to the values being quantized can significantly reduce the quantization error under provable conditions. Building on the theoretical insight, NoisyQuant achieves the first success on actively altering the heavy-tailed activation distribution with additive noisy bias to fit a given quantizer. Extensive experiments show NoisyQuant largely improves the post-training quantization performance of vision transformer with minimal computation overhead. For instance, on linear uniform 6-bit activation quantization, NoisyQuant improves SOTA top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by up to 1.7%, 1.1% and 0.5% for ViT, DeiT, and Swin Transformer respectively, achieving on-par or even higher performance than previous nonlinear, mixed-precision quantization. 

### Wavelet Diffusion Models are fast and scalable Image Generators
Diffusion models are rising as a powerful solution for high-fidelity image generation, which exceeds GANs in quality in many circumstances. However, their slow training and inference speed is a huge bottleneck, blocking them from being used in real-time applications. A recent DiffusionGAN method significantly decreases the models' running time by reducing the number of sampling steps from thousands to several, but their speeds still largely lag behind the GAN counterparts. This paper aims to reduce the speed gap by proposing a novel wavelet-based diffusion structure. We extract low-and-high frequency components from both image and feature levels via wavelet decomposition and adaptively handle these components for faster processing while maintaining good generation quality. Furthermore, we propose to use a reconstruction term, which effectively boosts the model training convergence. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, LSUN-Church, and STL-10 datasets prove our solution is a stepping-stone to offering real-time and high-fidelity diffusion models. Our code and pre-trained checkpoints will be available at \url{https://github.com/VinAIResearch/WaveDiff.git}. 

### Context-Aware Robust Fine-Tuning
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained (CLIP) models have zero-shot ability of classifying an image belonging to "[CLASS]" by using similarity between the image and the prompt sentence "a [CONTEXT] of [CLASS]". Based on exhaustive text cues in "[CONTEXT]", CLIP model is aware of different contexts, e.g. background, style, viewpoint, and exhibits unprecedented robustness against a wide range of distribution shifts. However, recent works find further fine-tuning of CLIP models improves accuracy but sacrifices the robustness on downstream tasks. We conduct an empirical investigation to show fine-tuning will corrupt the context-aware ability of pre-trained CLIP features. To solve this problem, we propose Context-Aware Robust Fine-tuning (CAR-FT). CAR-FT regularizes the model during fine-tuning to capture the context information. Specifically, we use zero-shot prompt weights to get the context distribution contained in the image. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between context distributions induced by original/fine-tuned CLIP models, CAR-FT makes the context-aware ability of CLIP inherited into downstream tasks, and achieves both higher In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) accuracy. The experimental results show CAR-FT achieves superior robustness on five OOD test datasets of ImageNet, and meanwhile brings accuracy gains on nine downstream tasks. Additionally, CAR-FT surpasses previous Domain Generalization (DG) methods and gets 78.5% averaged accuracy on DomainBed benchmark, building the new state-of-the-art. 

### SuS-X: Training-Free Name-Only Transfer of Vision-Language Models
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has emerged as a simple yet effective way to train large-scale vision-language models. CLIP demonstrates impressive zero-shot classification and retrieval on diverse downstream tasks. However, to leverage its full potential, fine-tuning still appears to be necessary. Fine-tuning the entire CLIP model can be resource-intensive and unstable. Moreover, recent methods that aim to circumvent this need for fine-tuning still require access to images from the target distribution. In this paper, we pursue a different approach and explore the regime of training-free "name-only transfer" in which the only knowledge we possess about the downstream task comprises the names of downstream target categories. We propose a novel method, SuS-X, consisting of two key building blocks -- SuS and TIP-X, that requires neither intensive fine-tuning nor costly labelled data. SuS-X achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot classification results on 19 benchmark datasets. We further show the utility of TIP-X in the training-free few-shot setting, where we again achieve state-of-the-art results over strong training-free baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/vishaal27/SuS-X. 

### Metal-conscious Embedding for CBCT Projection Inpainting
The existence of metallic implants in projection images for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) introduces undesired artifacts which degrade the quality of reconstructed images. In order to reduce metal artifacts, projection inpainting is an essential step in many metal artifact reduction algorithms. In this work, a hybrid network combining the shift window (Swin) vision transformer (ViT) and a convolutional neural network is proposed as a baseline network for the inpainting task. To incorporate metal information for the Swin ViT-based encoder, metal-conscious self-embedding and neighborhood-embedding methods are investigated. Both methods have improved the performance of the baseline network. Furthermore, by choosing appropriate window size, the model with neighborhood-embedding could achieve the lowest mean absolute error of 0.079 in metal regions and the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio of 42.346 in CBCT projections. At the end, the efficiency of metal-conscious embedding on both simulated and real cadaver CBCT data has been demonstrated, where the inpainting capability of the baseline network has been enhanced. 

### Ada3Diff: Defending against 3D Adversarial Point Clouds via Adaptive  Diffusion
Deep 3D point cloud models are sensitive to adversarial attacks, which poses threats to safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Robust training and defend-by-denoise are typical strategies for defending adversarial perturbations, including adversarial training and statistical filtering, respectively. However, they either induce massive computational overhead or rely heavily upon specified noise priors, limiting generalized robustness against attacks of all kinds. This paper introduces a new defense mechanism based on denoising diffusion models that can adaptively remove diverse noises with a tailored intensity estimator. Specifically, we first estimate adversarial distortions by calculating the distance of the points to their neighborhood best-fit plane. Depending on the distortion degree, we choose specific diffusion time steps for the input point cloud and perform the forward diffusion to disrupt potential adversarial shifts. Then we conduct the reverse denoising process to restore the disrupted point cloud back to a clean distribution. This approach enables effective defense against adaptive attacks with varying noise budgets, achieving accentuated robustness of existing 3D deep recognition models. 

### PatchMatch-Stereo-Panorama, a fast dense reconstruction from 360°  video images
This work proposes a new method for real-time dense 3d reconstruction for common 360{\deg} action cams, which can be mounted on small scouting UAVs during USAR missions. The proposed method extends a feature based Visual monocular SLAM (OpenVSLAM, based on the popular ORB-SLAM) for robust long-term localization on equirectangular video input by adding an additional densification thread that computes dense correspondences for any given keyframe with respect to a local keyframe-neighboorhood using a PatchMatch-Stereo-approach. While PatchMatch-Stereo-types of algorithms are considered state of the art for large scale Mutli-View-Stereo they had not been adapted so far for real-time dense 3d reconstruction tasks. This work describes a new massively parallel variant of the PatchMatch-Stereo-algorithm that differs from current approaches in two ways: First it supports the equirectangular camera model while other solutions are limited to the pinhole camera model. Second it is optimized for low latency while keeping a high level of completeness and accuracy. To achieve this it operates only on small sequences of keyframes, but employs techniques to compensate for the potential loss of accuracy due to the limited number of frames. Results demonstrate that dense 3d reconstruction is possible on a consumer grade laptop with a recent mobile GPU and that it is possible with improved accuracy and completeness over common offline-MVS solutions with comparable quality settings. 

### How Many Tweets DoWe Need?: Efficient Mining of Short-Term Polarized  Topics on Twitter: A Case Study From Japan
In recent years, social media has been criticized for yielding polarization. Identifying emerging disagreements and growing polarization is important for journalists to create alerts and provide more balanced coverage. While recent studies have shown the existence of polarization on social media, they primarily focused on limited topics such as politics with a large volume of data collected in the long term, especially over months or years. While these findings are helpful, they are too late to create an alert immediately. To address this gap, we develop a domain-agnostic mining method to identify polarized topics on Twitter in a short-term period, namely 12 hours. As a result, we find that daily Japanese news-related topics in early 2022 were polarized by 31.6\% within a 12-hour range. We also analyzed that they tend to construct information diffusion networks with a relatively high average degree, and half of the tweets are created by a relatively small number of people. However, it is very costly and impractical to collect a large volume of tweets daily on many topics and monitor the polarization due to the limitations of the Twitter API. To make it more cost-efficient, we also develop a prediction method using machine learning techniques to estimate the polarization level using randomly collected tweets leveraging the network information. Extensive experiments show a significant saving in collection costs compared to baseline methods. In particular, our approach achieves F-score of 0.85, requiring 4,000 tweets, 4x savings than the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the polarization level of the topics with low-resource tweets. Our findings have profound implications for the news media, allowing journalists to detect and disseminate polarizing information quickly and efficiently. 

### DBA: Efficient Transformer with Dynamic Bilinear Low-Rank Attention
Many studies have been conducted to improve the efficiency of Transformer from quadric to linear. Among them, the low-rank-based methods aim to learn the projection matrices to compress the sequence length. However, the projection matrices are fixed once they have been learned, which compress sequence length with dedicated coefficients for tokens in the same position. Adopting such input-invariant projections ignores the fact that the most informative part of a sequence varies from sequence to sequence, thus failing to preserve the most useful information that lies in varied positions. In addition, previous efficient Transformers only focus on the influence of sequence length while neglecting the effect of hidden state dimension. To address the aforementioned problems, we present an efficient yet effective attention mechanism, namely the Dynamic Bilinear Low-Rank Attention (DBA), which compresses the sequence length by input-sensitive dynamic projection matrices and achieves linear time and space complexity by jointly optimizing the sequence length and hidden state dimension while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first theoretically demonstrate that the sequence length can be compressed non-destructively from a novel perspective of information theory, with compression matrices dynamically determined by the input sequence. Furthermore, we show that the hidden state dimension can be approximated by extending the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, optimizing the attention in bilinear form. Theoretical analysis shows that DBA is proficient in capturing high-order relations in cross-attention problems. Experiments over tasks with diverse sequence length conditions show that DBA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with various strong baselines while maintaining less memory consumption with higher speed. 

### DATID-3D: Diversity-Preserved Domain Adaptation Using Text-to-Image  Diffusion for 3D Generative Model
Recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable performance in synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images with view consistency and detailed 3D shapes, but training them for diverse domains is challenging since it requires massive training images and their camera distribution information. Text-guided domain adaptation methods have shown impressive performance on converting the 2D generative model on one domain into the models on other domains with different styles by leveraging the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), rather than collecting massive datasets for those domains. However, one drawback of them is that the sample diversity in the original generative model is not well-preserved in the domain-adapted generative models due to the deterministic nature of the CLIP text encoder. Text-guided domain adaptation will be even more challenging for 3D generative models not only because of catastrophic diversity loss, but also because of inferior text-image correspondence and poor image quality. Here we propose DATID-3D, a domain adaptation method tailored for 3D generative models using text-to-image diffusion models that can synthesize diverse images per text prompt without collecting additional images and camera information for the target domain. Unlike 3D extensions of prior text-guided domain adaptation methods, our novel pipeline was able to fine-tune the state-of-the-art 3D generator of the source domain to synthesize high resolution, multi-view consistent images in text-guided targeted domains without additional data, outperforming the existing text-guided domain adaptation methods in diversity and text-image correspondence. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate diverse 3D image manipulations such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction to fully enjoy diversity in text. 

### NeuralLift-360: Lifting An In-the-wild 2D Photo to A 3D Object with  360° Views
Virtual reality and augmented reality (XR) bring increasing demand for 3D content. However, creating high-quality 3D content requires tedious work that a human expert must do. In this work, we study the challenging task of lifting a single image to a 3D object and, for the first time, demonstrate the ability to generate a plausible 3D object with 360{\deg} views that correspond well with the given reference image. By conditioning on the reference image, our model can fulfill the everlasting curiosity for synthesizing novel views of objects from images. Our technique sheds light on a promising direction of easing the workflows for 3D artists and XR designers. We propose a novel framework, dubbed NeuralLift-360, that utilizes a depth-aware neural radiance representation (NeRF) and learns to craft the scene guided by denoising diffusion models. By introducing a ranking loss, our NeuralLift-360 can be guided with rough depth estimation in the wild. We also adopt a CLIP-guided sampling strategy for the diffusion prior to provide coherent guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NeuralLift-360 significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/NeuralLift-360/ 

### Retweets Distort Exposure to Polarized Information
The growing prominence of social media in public discourse has led to greater scrutiny of the quality of information spreading online and the role that polarization plays in this process. However, studies of information spread on social media platforms like Twitter have been hampered by the difficulty of collecting data about the social graph, specifically follow links that shape what users see in their timelines. As a proxy of the follower graph, researchers use retweets to construct the diffusion graph, although it is not clear how these proxies affect studies of online information ecosystems. Using a dataset containing a sample of the Twitter follower graph and the tweets posted by users within it, we reconstruct the retweet graph and quantify its impact on the measures of exposure. While we find that echo chambers exist in both networks, they are more pronounced in the retweet neighborhood. We compare the polarization of information users see via their follower and retweet graphs to show that retweeted accounts systematically share more politically extreme content and misinformation. This bias cannot be explained by the activity or polarization within users' own social neighborhoods but by the increased attention they pay to more polarized sources. Our results suggest that studies relying on the follower graphs underestimate the polarization of information users pay attention to online. 

### DiffPose: Multi-hypothesis Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion models
Traditionally, monocular 3D human pose estimation employs a machine learning model to predict the most likely 3D pose for a given input image. However, a single image can be highly ambiguous and induces multiple plausible solutions for the 2D-3D lifting step which results in overly confident 3D pose predictors. To this end, we propose \emph{DiffPose}, a conditional diffusion model, that predicts multiple hypotheses for a given input image. In comparison to similar approaches, our diffusion model is straightforward and avoids intensive hyperparameter tuning, complex network structures, mode collapse, and unstable training. Moreover, we tackle a problem of the common two-step approach that first estimates a distribution of 2D joint locations via joint-wise heatmaps and consecutively approximates them based on first- or second-moment statistics. Since such a simplification of the heatmaps removes valid information about possibly correct, though labeled unlikely, joint locations, we propose to represent the heatmaps as a set of 2D joint candidate samples. To extract information about the original distribution from these samples we introduce our \emph{embedding transformer} that conditions the diffusion model. Experimentally, we show that DiffPose slightly improves upon the state of the art for multi-hypothesis pose estimation for simple poses and outperforms it by a large margin for highly ambiguous poses.
