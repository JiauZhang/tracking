**Title:** DS-Fusion: Artistic Typography via Discriminated and Stylized Diffusion  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09604

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel method to automatically generate an artistic typography by stylizing one or more letter fonts to visually convey the semantics of an input word, while ensuring that the output remains readable. To address an assortment of challenges with our task at hand including conflicting goals (artistic stylization vs. legibility), lack of ground truth, and immense search space, our approach utilizes large language models to bridge texts and visual images for stylization and build an unsupervised generative model with a diffusion model backbone. Specifically, we employ the denoising generator in Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), with the key addition of a CNN-based discriminator to adapt the input style onto the input text. The discriminator uses rasterized images of a given letter/word font as real samples and output of the denoising generator as fake samples. Our model is coined DS-Fusion for discriminated and stylized diffusion. We showcase the quality and versatility of our method through numerous examples, qualitative and quantitative evaluation, as well as ablation studies. User studies comparing to strong baselines including CLIPDraw and DALL-E 2, as well as artist-crafted typographies, demonstrate strong performance of DS-Fusion. 

**Title:** Measuring Improvement of F$_1$-Scores in Detection of Self-Admitted  Technical Debt  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09617

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have witnessed rapid, significant improvements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Utilizing Deep Learning, researchers have taken advantage of repository comments in Software Engineering to produce accurate methods for detecting Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) from 20 open-source Java projects' code. In this work, we improve SATD detection with a novel approach that leverages the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture. For comparison, we re-evaluated previous deep learning methods and applied stratified 10-fold cross-validation to report reliable F$_1$-scores. We examine our model in both cross-project and intra-project contexts. For each context, we use re-sampling and duplication as augmentation strategies to account for data imbalance. We find that our trained BERT model improves over the best performance of all previous methods in 19 of the 20 projects in cross-project scenarios. However, the data augmentation techniques were not sufficient to overcome the lack of data present in the intra-project scenarios, and existing methods still perform better. Future research will look into ways to diversify SATD datasets in order to maximize the latent power in large BERT models. 

**Title:** HIVE: Harnessing Human Feedback for Instructional Visual Editing  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09618

**Abstract:** Incorporating human feedback has been shown to be crucial to align text generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin. 

**Title:** Neural Architecture Search for Effective Teacher-Student Knowledge  Transfer in Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09639

**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of downstream tasks. Knowledge Distillation (KD) of a smaller student model addresses their inefficiency, allowing for deployment in resource-constraint environments. KD however remains ineffective, as the student is manually selected from a set of existing options already pre-trained on large corpora, a sub-optimal choice within the space of all possible student architectures. This paper proposes KD-NAS, the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) guided by the Knowledge Distillation process to find the optimal student model for distillation from a teacher, for a given natural language task. In each episode of the search process, a NAS controller predicts a reward based on a combination of accuracy on the downstream task and latency of inference. The top candidate architectures are then distilled from the teacher on a small proxy set. Finally the architecture(s) with the highest reward is selected, and distilled on the full downstream task training set. When distilling on the MNLI task, our KD-NAS model produces a 2 point improvement in accuracy on GLUE tasks with equivalent GPU latency with respect to a hand-crafted student architecture available in the literature. Using Knowledge Distillation, this model also achieves a 1.4x speedup in GPU Latency (3.2x speedup on CPU) with respect to a BERT-Base Teacher, while maintaining 97% performance on GLUE Tasks (without CoLA). We also obtain an architecture with equivalent performance as the hand-crafted student model on the GLUE benchmark, but with a 15% speedup in GPU latency (20% speedup in CPU latency) and 0.8 times the number of parameters 

**Title:** SUD$^2$: Supervision by Denoising Diffusion Models for Image  Reconstruction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09642

**Abstract:** Many imaging inverse problems$\unicode{x2014}$such as image-dependent in-painting and dehazing$\unicode{x2014}$are challenging because their forward models are unknown or depend on unknown latent parameters. While one can solve such problems by training a neural network with vast quantities of paired training data, such paired training data is often unavailable. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for training image reconstruction networks when paired training data is scarce. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of image denoising algorithms and, by extension, denoising diffusion models to supervise network training in the absence of paired training data. 

**Title:** Shifted-Windows Transformers for the Detection of Cerebral Aneurysms in  Microsurgery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09648

**Abstract:** Purpose: Microsurgical Aneurysm Clipping Surgery (MACS) carries a high risk for intraoperative aneurysm rupture. Automated recognition of instances when the aneurysm is exposed in the surgical video would be a valuable reference point for neuronavigation, indicating phase transitioning and more importantly designating moments of high risk for rupture. This article introduces the MACS dataset containing 16 surgical videos with frame-level expert annotations and proposes a learning methodology for surgical scene understanding identifying video frames with the aneurysm present in the operating microscope's field-of-view. Methods: Despite the dataset imbalance (80% no presence, 20% presence) and developed without explicit annotations, we demonstrate the applicability of Transformer-based deep learning architectures (MACSSwin-T, vidMACSSwin-T) to detect the aneurysm and classify MACS frames accordingly. We evaluate the proposed models in multiple-fold cross-validation experiments with independent sets and in an unseen set of 15 images against 10 human experts (neurosurgeons). Results: Average (across folds) accuracy of 80.8% (range 78.5%-82.4%) and 87.1% (range 85.1%-91.3%) is obtained for the image- and video-level approach respectively, demonstrating that the models effectively learn the classification task. Qualitative evaluation of the models' class activation maps show these to be localized on the aneurysm's actual location. Depending on the decision threshold, MACSWin-T achieves 66.7% to 86.7% accuracy in the unseen images, compared to 82% of human raters, with moderate to strong correlation. 

**Title:** Iterative Soft Shrinkage Learning for Efficient Image Super-Resolution  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09650

**Abstract:** The field of image super-resolution (SR) has witnessed extensive neural network designs from CNN to transformer architectures. However, prevailing SR models suffer from prohibitive memory footprint and intensive computations, which limits further deployment on computational-constrained platforms. In this work, we investigate the potential of network pruning for super-resolution to take advantage of off-the-shelf network designs and reduce the underlying computational overhead. Two main challenges remain in applying pruning methods for SR. First, the widely-used filter pruning technique reflects limited granularity and restricted adaptability to diverse network structures. Second, existing pruning methods generally operate upon a pre-trained network for the sparse structure determination, failing to get rid of dense model training in the traditional SR paradigm. To address these challenges, we adopt unstructured pruning with sparse models directly trained from scratch. Specifically, we propose a novel Iterative Soft Shrinkage-Percentage (ISS-P) method by optimizing the sparse structure of a randomly initialized network at each iteration and tweaking unimportant weights with a small amount proportional to the magnitude scale on-the-fly. We observe that the proposed ISS-P could dynamically learn sparse structures adapting to the optimization process and preserve the sparse model's trainability by yielding a more regularized gradient throughput. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISS-P compared with state-of-the-art methods over diverse network architectures. 

**Title:** Efficient Computation Sharing for Multi-Task Visual Scene Understanding  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09663

**Abstract:** Solving multiple visual tasks using individual models can be resource-intensive, while multi-task learning can conserve resources by sharing knowledge across different tasks. Despite the benefits of multi-task learning, such techniques can struggle with balancing the loss for each task, leading to potential performance degradation. We present a novel computation- and parameter-sharing framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to perform multiple visual tasks utilizing individually-trained single-task transformers. Our method is motivated by transfer learning schemes to reduce computational and parameter storage costs while maintaining the desired performance. Our approach involves splitting the tasks into a base task and the other sub-tasks, and sharing a significant portion of activations and parameters/weights between the base and sub-tasks to decrease inter-task redundancies and enhance knowledge sharing. The evaluation conducted on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-context datasets shows that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art transformer-based multi-task learning techniques with higher accuracy and reduced computational resources. Moreover, our method is extended to video stream inputs, further reducing computational costs by efficiently sharing information across the temporal domain as well as the task domain. Our codes and models will be publicly available. 

**Title:** Instance-Conditioned GAN Data Augmentation for Representation Learning  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09677

**Abstract:** Data augmentation has become a crucial component to train state-of-the-art visual representation models. However, handcrafting combinations of transformations that lead to improved performances is a laborious task, which can result in visually unrealistic samples. To overcome these limitations, recent works have explored the use of generative models as learnable data augmentation tools, showing promising results in narrow application domains, e.g., few-shot learning and low-data medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce a data augmentation module, called DA_IC-GAN, which leverages instance-conditioned GAN generations and can be used off-the-shelf in conjunction with most state-of-the-art training recipes. We showcase the benefits of DA_IC-GAN by plugging it out-of-the-box into the supervised training of ResNets and DeiT models on the ImageNet dataset, and achieving accuracy boosts up to between 1%p and 2%p with the highest capacity models. Moreover, the learnt representations are shown to be more robust than the baselines when transferred to a handful of out-of-distribution datasets, and exhibit increased invariance to variations of instance and viewpoints. We additionally couple DA_IC-GAN with a self-supervised training recipe and show that we can also achieve an improvement of 1%p in accuracy in some settings. With this work, we strengthen the evidence on the potential of learnable data augmentations to improve visual representation learning, paving the road towards non-handcrafted augmentations in model training. 

**Title:** Event-based Human Pose Tracking by Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09681

**Abstract:** Event camera, as an emerging biologically-inspired vision sensor for capturing motion dynamics, presents new potential for 3D human pose tracking, or video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, existing works in pose tracking either require the presence of additional gray-scale images to establish a solid starting pose, or ignore the temporal dependencies all together by collapsing segments of event streams to form static image frames. Meanwhile, although the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs, a.k.a. dense deep learning) has been showcased in many event-based tasks, the use of ANNs tends to neglect the fact that compared to the dense frame-based image sequences, the occurrence of events from an event camera is spatiotemporally much sparser. Motivated by the above mentioned issues, we present in this paper a dedicated end-to-end \textit{sparse deep learning} approach for event-based pose tracking: 1) to our knowledge this is the first time that 3D human pose tracking is obtained from events only, thus eliminating the need of accessing to any frame-based images as part of input; 2) our approach is based entirely upon the framework of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which consists of Spike-Element-Wise (SEW) ResNet and our proposed spiking spatiotemporal transformer; 3) a large-scale synthetic dataset is constructed that features a broad and diverse set of annotated 3D human motions, as well as longer hours of event stream data, named SynEventHPD. Empirical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both performance and efficiency measures. For example, with comparable performance to the state-of-the-art ANNs counterparts, our approach achieves a computation reduction of 20\% in FLOPS. Our implementation is made available at https://github.com/JimmyZou/HumanPoseTracking_SNN and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance. 

**Title:** PersonalTailor: Personalizing 2D Pattern Design from 3D Garment Point  Clouds  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09695

**Abstract:** Garment pattern design aims to convert a 3D garment to the corresponding 2D panels and their sewing structure. Existing methods rely either on template fitting with heuristics and prior assumptions, or on model learning with complicated shape parameterization. Importantly, both approaches do not allow for personalization of the output garment, which today has increasing demands. To fill this demand, we introduce PersonalTailor: a personalized 2D pattern design method, where the user can input specific constraints or demands (in language or sketch) for personal 2D panel fabrication from 3D point clouds. PersonalTailor first learns a multi-modal panel embeddings based on unsupervised cross-modal association and attentive fusion. It then predicts a binary panel masks individually using a transformer encoder-decoder framework. Extensive experiments show that our PersonalTailor excels on both personalized and standard pattern fabrication tasks. 

**Title:** ElasticViT: Conflict-aware Supernet Training for Deploying Fast Vision  Transformer on Diverse Mobile Devices  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09730

**Abstract:** Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown promising performance in the automatic design of vision transformers (ViT) exceeding 1G FLOPs. However, designing lightweight and low-latency ViT models for diverse mobile devices remains a big challenge. In this work, we propose ElasticViT, a two-stage NAS approach that trains a high-quality ViT supernet over a very large search space that supports a wide range of mobile devices, and then searches an optimal sub-network (subnet) for direct deployment. However, prior supernet training methods that rely on uniform sampling suffer from the gradient conflict issue: the sampled subnets can have vastly different model sizes (e.g., 50M vs. 2G FLOPs), leading to different optimization directions and inferior performance. To address this challenge, we propose two novel sampling techniques: complexity-aware sampling and performance-aware sampling. Complexity-aware sampling limits the FLOPs difference among the subnets sampled across adjacent training steps, while covering different-sized subnets in the search space. Performance-aware sampling further selects subnets that have good accuracy, which can reduce gradient conflicts and improve supernet quality. Our discovered models, ElasticViT models, achieve top-1 accuracy from 67.2% to 80.0% on ImageNet from 60M to 800M FLOPs without extra retraining, outperforming all prior CNNs and ViTs in terms of accuracy and latency. Our tiny and small models are also the first ViT models that surpass state-of-the-art CNNs with significantly lower latency on mobile devices. For instance, ElasticViT-S1 runs 2.62x faster than EfficientNet-B0 with 0.1% higher accuracy. 

**Title:** SRFormer: Permuted Self-Attention for Single Image Super-Resolution  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09735

**Abstract:** Previous works have shown that increasing the window size for Transformer-based image super-resolution models (e.g., SwinIR) can significantly improve the model performance but the computation overhead is also considerable. In this paper, we present SRFormer, a simple but novel method that can enjoy the benefit of large window self-attention but introduces even less computational burden. The core of our SRFormer is the permuted self-attention (PSA), which strikes an appropriate balance between the channel and spatial information for self-attention. Our PSA is simple and can be easily applied to existing super-resolution networks based on window self-attention. Without any bells and whistles, we show that our SRFormer achieves a 33.86dB PSNR score on the Urban100 dataset, which is 0.46dB higher than that of SwinIR but uses fewer parameters and computations. We hope our simple and effective approach can serve as a useful tool for future research in super-resolution model design. 

**Title:** CoLT5: Faster Long-Range Transformers with Conditional Computation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09752

**Abstract:** Many natural language processing tasks benefit from long inputs, but processing long documents with Transformers is expensive -- not only due to quadratic attention complexity but also from applying feedforward and projection layers to every token. However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. We propose CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. We show that CoLT5 achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference, achieving SOTA on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark. Moreover, CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length. 

**Title:** Diffusing the Optimal Topology: A Generative Optimization Approach  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09760

**Abstract:** Topology Optimization seeks to find the best design that satisfies a set of constraints while maximizing system performance. Traditional iterative optimization methods like SIMP can be computationally expensive and get stuck in local minima, limiting their applicability to complex or large-scale problems. Learning-based approaches have been developed to accelerate the topology optimization process, but these methods can generate designs with floating material and low performance when challenged with out-of-distribution constraint configurations. Recently, deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, conditioned on constraints and physics fields have shown promise, but they require extensive pre-processing and surrogate models for improving performance. To address these issues, we propose a Generative Optimization method that integrates classic optimization like SIMP as a refining mechanism for the topology generated by a deep generative model. We also remove the need for conditioning on physical fields using a computationally inexpensive approximation inspired by classic ODE solutions and reduce the number of steps needed to generate a feasible and performant topology. Our method allows us to efficiently generate good topologies and explicitly guide them to regions with high manufacturability and high performance, without the need for external auxiliary models or additional labeled data. We believe that our method can lead to significant advancements in the design and optimization of structures in engineering applications, and can be applied to a broader spectrum of performance-aware engineering design problems. 

**Title:** Denoising Diffusion Autoencoders are Unified Self-supervised Learners  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09769

**Abstract:** Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models, which are reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, we investigate whether they can acquire discriminative representations for classification via generative pre-training. This paper shows that the networks in diffusion models, namely denoising diffusion autoencoders (DDAE), are unified self-supervised learners: by pre-training on unconditional image generation, DDAE has already learned strongly linear-separable representations at its intermediate layers without auxiliary encoders, thus making diffusion pre-training emerge as a general approach for self-supervised generative and discriminative learning. To verify this, we perform linear probe and fine-tuning evaluations on multi-class datasets. Our diffusion-based approach achieves 95.9% and 50.0% linear probe accuracies on CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, and is comparable to masked autoencoders and contrastive learning for the first time. Additionally, transfer learning from ImageNet confirms DDAE's suitability for latent-space Vision Transformers, suggesting the potential for scaling DDAEs as unified foundation models. 

**Title:** TKN: Transformer-based Keypoint Prediction Network For Real-time Video  Prediction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09807

**Abstract:** Video prediction is a complex time-series forecasting task with great potential in many use cases. However, conventional methods overemphasize accuracy while ignoring the slow prediction speed caused by complicated model structures that learn too much redundant information with excessive GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, conventional methods mostly predict frames sequentially (frame-by-frame) and thus are hard to accelerate. Consequently, valuable use cases such as real-time danger prediction and warning cannot achieve fast enough inference speed to be applicable in reality. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based keypoint prediction neural network (TKN), an unsupervised learning method that boost the prediction process via constrained information extraction and parallel prediction scheme. TKN is the first real-time video prediction solution to our best knowledge, while significantly reducing computation costs and maintaining other performance. Extensive experiments on KTH and Human3.6 datasets demonstrate that TKN predicts 11 times faster than existing methods while reducing memory consumption by 17.4% and achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance on average. 

**Title:** DiffusionSeg: Adapting Diffusion Towards Unsupervised Object Discovery  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09813

**Abstract:** Learning from a large corpus of data, pre-trained models have achieved impressive progress nowadays. As popular generative pre-training, diffusion models capture both low-level visual knowledge and high-level semantic relations. In this paper, we propose to exploit such knowledgeable diffusion models for mainstream discriminative tasks, i.e., unsupervised object discovery: saliency segmentation and object localization. However, the challenges exist as there is one structural difference between generative and discriminative models, which limits the direct use. Besides, the lack of explicitly labeled data significantly limits performance in unsupervised settings. To tackle these issues, we introduce DiffusionSeg, one novel synthesis-exploitation framework containing two-stage strategies. To alleviate data insufficiency, we synthesize abundant images, and propose a novel training-free AttentionCut to obtain masks in the first synthesis stage. In the second exploitation stage, to bridge the structural gap, we use the inversion technique, to map the given image back to diffusion features. These features can be directly used by downstream architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of adapting diffusion for unsupervised object discovery. 

**Title:** Transformers and Ensemble methods: A solution for Hate Speech Detection  in Arabic languages  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09823

**Abstract:** This paper describes our participation in the shared task of hate speech detection, which is one of the subtasks of the CERIST NLP Challenge 2022. Our experiments evaluate the performance of six transformer models and their combination using 2 ensemble approaches. The best results on the training set, in a five-fold cross validation scenario, were obtained by using the ensemble approach based on the majority vote. The evaluation of this approach on the test set resulted in an F1-score of 0.60 and an Accuracy of 0.86. 

**Title:** FreeDoM: Training-Free Energy-Guided Conditional Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09833

**Abstract:** Recently, conditional diffusion models have gained popularity in numerous applications due to their exceptional generation ability. However, many existing methods are training-required. They need to train a time-dependent classifier or a condition-dependent score estimator, which increases the cost of constructing conditional diffusion models and is inconvenient to transfer across different conditions. Some current works aim to overcome this limitation by proposing training-free solutions, but most can only be applied to a specific category of tasks and not to more general conditions. In this work, we propose a training-Free conditional Diffusion Model (FreeDoM) used for various conditions. Specifically, we leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained networks, such as a face detection model, to construct time-independent energy functions, which guide the generation process without requiring training. Furthermore, because the construction of the energy function is very flexible and adaptable to various conditions, our proposed FreeDoM has a broader range of applications than existing training-free methods. FreeDoM is advantageous in its simplicity, effectiveness, and low cost. Experiments demonstrate that FreeDoM is effective for various conditions and suitable for diffusion models of diverse data domains, including image and latent code domains. 

**Title:** GADFormer: An Attention-based Model for Group Anomaly Detection on  Trajectories  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09841

**Abstract:** Group Anomaly Detection (GAD) reveals anomalous behavior among groups consisting of multiple member instances, which are, individually considered, not necessarily anomalous. This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. However, with increasing amount and heterogenity of group members, actual abnormal groups get harder to detect, especially in an unsupervised or semi-supervised setting. Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, but recent works have shown that their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, we introduce with this paper GADFormer, a GAD specific BERT architecture, capable to perform attention-based Group Anomaly Detection on trajectories in an unsupervised and semi-supervised setting. We show formally and experimentally how trajectory outlier detection can be realized as an attention-based Group Anomaly Detection problem. Furthermore, we introduce a Block Attention-anomaly Score (BAS) to improve the interpretability of transformer encoder blocks for GAD. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows us to optimize the training for domain-specific GAD. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus GRU in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic and real world datasets. 

**Title:** Dual-path Adaptation from Image to Video Transformers  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09857

**Abstract:** In this paper, we efficiently transfer the surpassing representation power of the vision foundation models, such as ViT and Swin, for video understanding with only a few trainable parameters. Previous adaptation methods have simultaneously considered spatial and temporal modeling with a unified learnable module but still suffered from fully leveraging the representative capabilities of image transformers. We argue that the popular dual-path (two-stream) architecture in video models can mitigate this problem. We propose a novel DualPath adaptation separated into spatial and temporal adaptation paths, where a lightweight bottleneck adapter is employed in each transformer block. Especially for temporal dynamic modeling, we incorporate consecutive frames into a grid-like frameset to precisely imitate vision transformers' capability that extrapolates relationships between tokens. In addition, we extensively investigate the multiple baselines from a unified perspective in video understanding and compare them with DualPath. Experimental results on four action recognition benchmarks prove that pretrained image transformers with DualPath can be effectively generalized beyond the data domain. 

**Title:** Trained on 100 million words and still in shape: BERT meets British  National Corpus  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09859

**Abstract:** While modern masked language models (LMs) are trained on ever larger corpora, we here explore the effects of down-scaling training to a modestly-sized but representative, well-balanced, and publicly available English text source -- the British National Corpus. We show that pre-training on this carefully curated corpus can reach better performance than the original BERT model. We argue that this type of corpora has great potential as a language modeling benchmark. To showcase this potential, we present fair, reproducible and data-efficient comparative studies of LMs, in which we evaluate several training objectives and model architectures and replicate previous empirical results in a systematic way. We propose an optimized LM architecture called LTG-BERT. 

**Title:** DiffusionRet: Generative Text-Video Retrieval with Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09867

**Abstract:** Existing text-video retrieval solutions are, in essence, discriminant models focused on maximizing the conditional likelihood, i.e., p(candidates|query). While straightforward, this de facto paradigm overlooks the underlying data distribution p(query), which makes it challenging to identify out-of-distribution data. To address this limitation, we creatively tackle this task from a generative viewpoint and model the correlation between the text and the video as their joint probability p(candidates,query). This is accomplished through a diffusion-based text-video retrieval framework (DiffusionRet), which models the retrieval task as a process of gradually generating joint distribution from noise. During training, DiffusionRet is optimized from both the generation and discrimination perspectives, with the generator being optimized by generation loss and the feature extractor trained with contrastive loss. In this way, DiffusionRet cleverly leverages the strengths of both generative and discriminative methods. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks, including MSRVTT, LSMDC, MSVD, ActivityNet Captions, and DiDeMo, with superior performances, justify the efficacy of our method. More encouragingly, without any modification, DiffusionRet even performs well in out-domain retrieval settings. We believe this work brings fundamental insights into the related fields. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpthu17/DiffusionRet. 

**Title:** Discovering mesoscopic descriptions of collective movement with neural  stochastic modelling  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09906

**Abstract:** Collective motion is an ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, inspiring engineers, physicists and mathematicians to develop mathematical models and bio-inspired designs. Collective motion at small to medium group sizes ($\sim$10-1000 individuals, also called the `mesoscale'), can show nontrivial features due to stochasticity. Therefore, characterizing both the deterministic and stochastic aspects of the dynamics is crucial in the study of mesoscale collective phenomena. Here, we use a physics-inspired, neural-network based approach to characterize the stochastic group dynamics of interacting individuals, through a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that governs the collective dynamics of the group. We apply this technique on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and identify the deterministic and stochastic aspects of the dynamics using drift and diffusion fields, enabling us to make novel inferences about the nature of order in these systems. 

**Title:** Rehearsal-Free Domain Continual Face Anti-Spoofing: Generalize More and  Forget Less  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09914

**Abstract:** Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is recently studied under the continual learning setting, where the FAS models are expected to evolve after encountering the data from new domains. However, existing methods need extra replay buffers to store previous data for rehearsal, which becomes infeasible when previous data is unavailable because of privacy issues. In this paper, we propose the first rehearsal-free method for Domain Continual Learning (DCL) of FAS, which deals with catastrophic forgetting and unseen domain generalization problems simultaneously. For better generalization to unseen domains, we design the Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) to adapt Vision Transformer (ViT) models during the continual learning sessions. To alleviate the forgetting of previous domains without using previous data, we propose the Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization (PPCR) to constrain the continual learning with previous domain knowledge from the proxy prototypes. Simulate practical DCL scenarios, we devise two new protocols which evaluate both generalization and anti-forgetting performance. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the generalization performance in unseen domains and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of the previous knowledge. The codes and protocols will be released soon. 

**Title:** Vision Transformer for Action Units Detection  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09917

**Abstract:** Facial Action Units detection (FAUs) represents a fine-grained classification problem that involves identifying different units on the human face, as defined by the Facial Action Coding System. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient Vision Transformer-based approach for addressing the task of Action Units (AU) detection in the context of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition. We employ the Video Vision Transformer(ViViT) Network to capture the temporal facial change in the video. Besides, to reduce massive size of the Vision Transformers model, we replace the ViViT feature extraction layers with the CNN backbone (Regnet). Our model outperform the baseline model of ABAW 2023 challenge, with a notable 14\% difference in result. Furthermore, the achieved results are comparable to those of the top three teams in the previous ABAW 2022 challenge. 

**Title:** Single-view Neural Radiance Fields with Depth Teacher  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09952

**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been proposed for photorealistic novel view rendering. However, it requires many different views of one scene for training. Moreover, it has poor generalizations to new scenes and requires retraining or fine-tuning on each scene. In this paper, we develop a new NeRF model for novel view synthesis using only a single image as input. We propose to combine the (coarse) planar rendering and the (fine) volume rendering to achieve higher rendering quality and better generalizations. We also design a depth teacher net that predicts dense pseudo depth maps to supervise the joint rendering mechanism and boost the learning of consistent 3D geometry. We evaluate our method on three challenging datasets. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-view NeRFs by achieving 5$\sim$20\% improvements in PSNR and reducing 20$\sim$50\% of the errors in the depth rendering. It also shows excellent generalization abilities to unseen data without the need to fine-tune on each new scene. 

**Title:** GNNFormer: A Graph-based Framework for Cytopathology Report Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09956

**Abstract:** Cytopathology report generation is a necessary step for the standardized examination of pathology images. However, manually writing detailed reports brings heavy workloads for pathologists. To improve efficiency, some existing works have studied automatic generation of cytopathology reports, mainly by applying image caption generation frameworks with visual encoders originally proposed for natural images. A common weakness of these works is that they do not explicitly model the structural information among cells, which is a key feature of pathology images and provides significant information for making diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based framework called GNNFormer, which seamlessly integrates graph neural network (GNN) and Transformer into the same framework, for cytopathology report generation. To the best of our knowledge, GNNFormer is the first report generation method that explicitly models the structural information among cells in pathology images. It also effectively fuses structural information among cells, fine-grained morphology features of cells and background features to generate high-quality reports. Experimental results on the NMI-WSI dataset show that GNNFormer can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines. 

**Title:** Adversarial Counterfactual Visual Explanations  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09962

**Abstract:** Counterfactual explanations and adversarial attacks have a related goal: flipping output labels with minimal perturbations regardless of their characteristics. Yet, adversarial attacks cannot be used directly in a counterfactual explanation perspective, as such perturbations are perceived as noise and not as actionable and understandable image modifications. Building on the robust learning literature, this paper proposes an elegant method to turn adversarial attacks into semantically meaningful perturbations, without modifying the classifiers to explain. The proposed approach hypothesizes that Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models are excellent regularizers for avoiding high-frequency and out-of-distribution perturbations when generating adversarial attacks. The paper's key idea is to build attacks through a diffusion model to polish them. This allows studying the target model regardless of its robustification level. Extensive experimentation shows the advantages of our counterfactual explanation approach over current State-of-the-Art in multiple testbeds. 

**Title:** Star-Net: Improving Single Image Desnowing Model With More Efficient  Connection and Diverse Feature Interaction  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09988

**Abstract:** Compared to other severe weather image restoration tasks, single image desnowing is a more challenging task. This is mainly due to the diversity and irregularity of snow shape, which makes it extremely difficult to restore images in snowy scenes. Moreover, snow particles also have a veiling effect similar to haze or mist. Although current works can effectively remove snow particles with various shapes, they also bring distortion to the restored image. To address these issues, we propose a novel single image desnowing network called Star-Net. First, we design a Star type Skip Connection (SSC) to establish information channels for all different scale features, which can deal with the complex shape of snow particles.Second, we present a Multi-Stage Interactive Transformer (MIT) as the base module of Star-Net, which is designed to better understand snow particle shapes and to address image distortion by explicitly modeling a variety of important image recovery features. Finally, we propose a Degenerate Filter Module (DFM) to filter the snow particle and snow fog residual in the SSC on the spatial and channel domains. Extensive experiments show that our Star-Net achieves state-of-the-art snow removal performances on three standard snow removal datasets and retains the original sharpness of the images. 

**Title:** TBP-Former: Learning Temporal Bird's-Eye-View Pyramid for Joint  Perception and Prediction in Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09998

**Abstract:** Vision-centric joint perception and prediction (PnP) has become an emerging trend in autonomous driving research. It predicts the future states of the traffic participants in the surrounding environment from raw RGB images. However, it is still a critical challenge to synchronize features obtained at multiple camera views and timestamps due to inevitable geometric distortions and further exploit those spatial-temporal features. To address this issue, we propose a temporal bird's-eye-view pyramid transformer (TBP-Former) for vision-centric PnP, which includes two novel designs. First, a pose-synchronized BEV encoder is proposed to map raw image inputs with any camera pose at any time to a shared and synchronized BEV space for better spatial-temporal synchronization. Second, a spatial-temporal pyramid transformer is introduced to comprehensively extract multi-scale BEV features and predict future BEV states with the support of spatial-temporal priors. Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset show that our proposed framework overall outperforms all state-of-the-art vision-based prediction methods. 

**Title:** GlueGen: Plug and Play Multi-modal Encoders for X-to-image Generation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10056

**Abstract:** Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion processes have achieved remarkable success in controllable image generation using user-provided captions. However, the tight coupling between the current text encoder and image decoder in T2I models makes it challenging to replace or upgrade. Such changes often require massive fine-tuning or even training from scratch with the prohibitive expense. To address this problem, we propose GlueGen, which applies a newly proposed GlueNet model to align features from single-modal or multi-modal encoders with the latent space of an existing T2I model. The approach introduces a new training objective that leverages parallel corpora to align the representation spaces of different encoders. Empirical results show that GlueNet can be trained efficiently and enables various capabilities beyond previous state-of-the-art models: 1) multilingual language models such as XLM-Roberta can be aligned with existing T2I models, allowing for the generation of high-quality images from captions beyond English; 2) GlueNet can align multi-modal encoders such as AudioCLIP with the Stable Diffusion model, enabling sound-to-image generation; 3) it can also upgrade the current text encoder of the latent diffusion model for challenging case generation. By the alignment of various feature representations, the GlueNet allows for flexible and efficient integration of new functionality into existing T2I models and sheds light on X-to-image (X2I) generation. 

**Title:** DialogPaint: A Dialog-based Image Editing Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10073

**Abstract:** We present DialogPaint, an innovative framework that employs an interactive conversational approach for image editing. The framework comprises a pretrained dialogue model (Blenderbot) and a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion). The dialogue model engages in conversation with users to understand their requirements and generates concise instructions based on the dialogue. Subsequently, the Stable Diffusion model employs these instructions, along with the input image, to produce the desired output. Due to the difficulty of acquiring fine-tuning data for such models, we leverage multiple large-scale models to generate simulated dialogues and corresponding image pairs. After fine-tuning our framework with the synthesized data, we evaluate its performance in real application scenes. The results demonstrate that DialogPaint excels in both objective and subjective evaluation metrics effectively handling ambiguous instructions and performing tasks such as object replacement, style transfer, color modification. Moreover, our framework supports multi-round editing, allowing for the completion of complicated editing tasks. 

**Title:** $α$Surf: Implicit Surface Reconstruction for Semi-Transparent and  Thin Objects with Decoupled Geometry and Opacity  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10083

**Abstract:** Implicit surface representations such as the signed distance function (SDF) have emerged as a promising approach for image-based surface reconstruction. However, existing optimization methods assume solid surfaces and are therefore unable to properly reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces and thin structures, which also exhibit low opacity due to the blending effect with the background. While neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods can model semi-transparency and achieve photo-realistic quality in synthesized novel views, their volumetric geometry representation tightly couples geometry and opacity, and therefore cannot be easily converted into surfaces without introducing artifacts. We present $\alpha$Surf, a novel surface representation with decoupled geometry and opacity for the reconstruction of semi-transparent and thin surfaces where the colors mix. Ray-surface intersections on our representation can be found in closed-form via analytical solutions of cubic polynomials, avoiding Monte-Carlo sampling and is fully differentiable by construction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach can accurately reconstruct surfaces with semi-transparent and thin parts with fewer artifacts, achieving better reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art SDF and NeRF methods.

**Title:** Data-Centric Learning from Unlabeled Graphs with Diffusion Model  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10108

**Abstract:** Graph property prediction tasks are important and numerous. While each task offers a small size of labeled examples, unlabeled graphs have been collected from various sources and at a large scale. A conventional approach is training a model with the unlabeled graphs on self-supervised tasks and then fine-tuning the model on the prediction tasks. However, the self-supervised task knowledge could not be aligned or sometimes conflicted with what the predictions needed. In this paper, we propose to extract the knowledge underlying the large set of unlabeled graphs as a specific set of useful data points to augment each property prediction model. We use a diffusion model to fully utilize the unlabeled graphs and design two new objectives to guide the model's denoising process with each task's labeled data to generate task-specific graph examples and their labels. Experiments demonstrate that our data-centric approach performs significantly better than fourteen existing various methods on fifteen tasks. The performance improvement brought by unlabeled data is visible as the generated labeled examples unlike self-supervised learning. 

**Title:** A Recipe for Watermarking Diffusion Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10137

**Abstract:** Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated their advantageous potential for generative tasks. Widespread interest exists in incorporating DMs into downstream applications, such as producing or editing photorealistic images. However, practical deployment and unprecedented power of DMs raise legal issues, including copyright protection and monitoring of generated content. In this regard, watermarking has been a proven solution for copyright protection and content monitoring, but it is underexplored in the DMs literature. Specifically, DMs generate samples from longer tracks and may have newly designed multimodal structures, necessitating the modification of conventional watermarking pipelines. To this end, we conduct comprehensive analyses and derive a recipe for efficiently watermarking state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion), via training from scratch or finetuning. Our recipe is straightforward but involves empirically ablated implementation details, providing a solid foundation for future research on watermarking DMs. Our Code: https://github.com/yunqing-me/WatermarkDM. 

**Title:** Denoising Diffusion Post-Processing for Low-Light Image Enhancement  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09627

**Abstract:** Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) techniques attempt to increase the visibility of images captured in low-light scenarios. However, as a result of enhancement, a variety of image degradations such as noise and color bias are revealed. Furthermore, each particular LLIE approach may introduce a different form of flaw within its enhanced results. To combat these image degradations, post-processing denoisers have widely been used, which often yield oversmoothed results lacking detail. We propose using a diffusion model as a post-processing approach, and we introduce Low-light Post-processing Diffusion Model (LPDM) in order to model the conditional distribution between under-exposed and normally-exposed images. We apply LPDM in a manner which avoids the computationally expensive generative reverse process of typical diffusion models, and post-process images in one pass through LPDM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing post-processing denoisers by increasing the perceptual quality of enhanced low-light images on a variety of challenging low-light datasets. Source code is available at https://github.com/savvaki/LPDM. 

**Title:** Progressive Content-aware Coded Hyperspectral Compressive Imaging  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09773

**Abstract:** Hyperspectral imaging plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, like remote sensing, medicine, and cytology. By acquiring 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) via 2D sensors, the coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) has achieved great success due to its hardware-friendly implementation and fast imaging speed. However, for some less spectrally sparse scenes, single snapshot and unreasonable coded aperture design tend to make HSI recovery more ill-posed and yield poor spatial and spectral fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Content-Aware CASSI framework, dubbed PCA-CASSI, which captures HSIs with multiple optimized content-aware coded apertures and fuses all the snapshots for reconstruction progressively. Simultaneously, by mapping the Range-Null space Decomposition (RND) into a deep network with several phases, an RND-HRNet is proposed for HSI recovery. Each recovery phase can fully exploit the hidden physical information in the coded apertures via explicit $\mathcal{R}$$-$$\mathcal{N}$ decomposition and explore the spatial-spectral correlation by dual transformer blocks. Our method is validated to surpass other state-of-the-art methods on both multiple- and single-shot HSI imaging tasks by large margins. 

**Title:** MedNeXt: Transformer-driven Scaling of ConvNets for Medical Image  Segmentation  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09975

**Abstract:** There has been exploding interest in embracing Transformer-based architectures for medical image segmentation. However, the lack of large-scale annotated medical datasets make achieving performances equivalent to those in natural images challenging. Convolutional networks, in contrast, have higher inductive biases and consequently, are easily trainable to high performance. Recently, the ConvNeXt architecture attempted to modernize the standard ConvNet by mirroring Transformer blocks. In this work, we improve upon this to design a modernized and scalable convolutional architecture customized to challenges of data-scarce medical settings. We introduce MedNeXt, a Transformer-inspired large kernel segmentation network which introduces - 1) A fully ConvNeXt 3D Encoder-Decoder Network for medical image segmentation, 2) Residual ConvNeXt up and downsampling blocks to preserve semantic richness across scales, 3) A novel technique to iteratively increase kernel sizes by upsampling small kernel networks, to prevent performance saturation on limited medical data, 4) Compound scaling at multiple levels (depth, width, kernel size) of MedNeXt. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on 4 tasks on CT and MRI modalities and varying dataset sizes, representing a modernized deep architecture for medical image segmentation. 

**Title:** On the momentum diffusion over multiphase surfaces with meshless methods  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09978

**Abstract:** This work investigates the effects of the choice of momentum diffusion operator on the evolution of multiphase fluid systems resolved with Meshless Lagrangian Methods (MLM). Specifically, the effects of a non-zero viscosity gradient at multiphase interfaces are explored. This work shows that both the typical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Generalized Finite Difference (GFD) diffusion operators under-predict the shear divergence at multiphase interfaces. Furthermore, it was shown that larger viscosity ratios increase the significance of this behavior. A multiphase GFD scheme is proposed that makes use of a computationally efficient diffusion operator that accounts for the effects arising from the jump discontinuity in viscosity. This scheme is used to simulate a 3D bubble submerged in a heavier fluid with a density ratio of 2:1 and a dynamic viscosity ratio of 100:1. When comparing the effects of momentum diffusion operators, a discrepancy of 57.2% was observed in the bubble's ascent velocity. 

**Title:** Configurable EBEN: Extreme Bandwidth Extension Network to enhance  body-conducted speech capture  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10008

**Abstract:** This paper presents a configurable version of Extreme Bandwidth Extension Network (EBEN), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to improve audio captured with body-conduction microphones. We show that these microphones significantly reduce environmental noise. However, this insensitivity to ambient noise is at the expense of the bandwidth of the voice signal acquired from the wearer of the devices. The obtained captured signals therefore require the use of signal enhancement techniques to recover the full-bandwidth speech. EBEN leverages a configurable multiband decomposition of the raw captured signal. This decomposition allows the data time domain dimensions to be reduced and the full band signal to be better controlled. The multiband representation of the captured signal is processed through a U-Net-like model, which combines feature and adversarial losses to generate an enhanced speech signal. We also benefit from this original representation in the proposed configurable discriminator architecture. The configurable EBEN approach can achieve state-of-the-art enhancement results on synthetic data with a lightweight generator that allows real-time processing. 

**Title:** Efficient Neural Generation of 4K Masks for Homogeneous Diffusion  Inpainting  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10096

**Abstract:** With well-selected data, homogeneous diffusion inpainting can reconstruct images from sparse data with high quality. While 4K colour images of size 3840 x 2160 can already be inpainted in real time, optimising the known data for applications like image compression remains challenging: Widely used stochastic strategies can take days for a single 4K image. Recently, a first neural approach for this so-called mask optimisation problem offered high speed and good quality for small images. It trains a mask generation network with the help of a neural inpainting surrogate. However, these mask networks can only output masks for the resolution and mask density they were trained for. We solve these problems and enable mask optimisation for high-resolution images through a neuroexplicit coarse-to-fine strategy. Additionally, we improve the training and interpretability of mask networks by including a numerical inpainting solver directly into the network. This allows to generate masks for 4K images in around 0.6 seconds while exceeding the quality of stochastic methods on practically relevant densities. Compared to popular existing approaches, this is an acceleration of up to four orders of magnitude. 

**Title:** GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of  Large Language Models  
**PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130

**Abstract:** We investigate the potential implications of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models and related technologies on the U.S. labor market. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth. We conclude that Generative Pre-trained Transformers exhibit characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting that as these models could have notable economic, social, and policy implications.
