### NLP meets psychotherapy: Using predicted client emotions and  self-reported client emotions to measure emotional coherence
Emotions are experienced and expressed through various response systems. Coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression is considered important to clients' well being. To date, emotional coherence (EC) has been studied at a single time point using lab-based tasks with relatively small datasets. No study has examined EC between the subjective experience of emotions and emotion expression in therapy or whether this coherence is associated with clients' well being. Natural language Processing (NLP) approaches have been applied to identify emotions from psychotherapy dialogue, which can be implemented to study emotional processes on a larger scale. However, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression over the course of therapy and whether it relates to clients' well-being. This work presents an end-to-end approach where we use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model to study emotional coherence and its diagnostic potential in psychotherapy research. We first employ our transformer based approach on a Hebrew psychotherapy dataset to automatically label clients' emotions at utterance level in psychotherapy dialogues. We subsequently investigate the emotional coherence between clients' self-reported emotional states and our model-based emotion predictions. We also examine the association between emotional coherence and clients' well being. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between clients' self-reported emotions and positive and negative emotions expressed verbally during psychotherapy sessions. Coherence in positive emotions was also highly correlated with clients well-being. These results illustrate how NLP can be applied to identify important emotional processes in psychotherapy to improve diagnosis and treatment for clients suffering from mental-health problems. 

### PVT3D: Point Voxel Transformers for Place Recognition from Sparse Lidar  Scans
Place recognition based on point cloud (LiDAR) scans is an important module for achieving robust autonomy in robots or self-driving vehicles. Training deep networks to match such scans presents a difficult trade-off: a higher spatial resolution of the network's intermediate representations is needed to perform fine-grained matching of subtle geometric features, but growing it too large makes the memory requirements infeasible. In this work, we propose a Point-Voxel Transformer network (PVT3D) that achieves robust fine-grained matching with low memory requirements. It leverages a sparse voxel branch to extract and aggregate information at a lower resolution and a point-wise branch to obtain fine-grained local information. A novel hierarchical cross-attention transformer (HCAT) uses queries from one branch to try to match structures in the other branch, ensuring that both extract self-contained descriptors of the point cloud (rather than one branch dominating), but using both to inform the output global descriptor of the point cloud. Extensive experiments show that the proposed PVT3D method surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large amount on several datasets (Oxford RobotCar, TUM, USyd). For instance, we achieve AR@1 of 85.6% on the TUM dataset, which surpasses the strongest prior model by ~15%. 

### Zero NeRF: Registration with Zero Overlap
We present Zero-NeRF, a projective surface registration method that, to the best of our knowledge, offers the first general solution capable of alignment between scene representations with minimal or zero visual correspondence. To do this, we enforce consistency between visible surfaces of partial and complete reconstructions, which allows us to constrain occluded geometry. We use a NeRF as our surface representation and the NeRF rendering pipeline to perform this alignment. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we register real-world scenes from opposite sides with infinitesimal overlaps that cannot be accurately registered using prior methods, and we compare these results against widely used registration methods. 

### Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling
Recent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant knowledge fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., multimodal documents on the web). Specifically, we implement a retriever using the pretrained CLIP model and a generator using the CM3 Transformer architecture, and train this model using the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate mixtures of text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities such as knowledge-intensive image generation and multimodal in-context learning. 

### Plug-and-Play Diffusion Features for Text-Driven Image-to-Image  Translation
Large-scale text-to-image generative models have been a revolutionary breakthrough in the evolution of generative AI, allowing us to synthesize diverse images that convey highly complex visual concepts. However, a pivotal challenge in leveraging such models for real-world content creation tasks is providing users with control over the generated content. In this paper, we present a new framework that takes text-to-image synthesis to the realm of image-to-image translation -- given a guidance image and a target text prompt, our method harnesses the power of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate a new image that complies with the target text, while preserving the semantic layout of the source image. Specifically, we observe and empirically demonstrate that fine-grained control over the generated structure can be achieved by manipulating spatial features and their self-attention inside the model. This results in a simple and effective approach, where features extracted from the guidance image are directly injected into the generation process of the target image, requiring no training or fine-tuning and applicable for both real or generated guidance images. We demonstrate high-quality results on versatile text-guided image translation tasks, including translating sketches, rough drawings and animations into realistic images, changing of the class and appearance of objects in a given image, and modifications of global qualities such as lighting and color. 

### SuperTran: Reference Based Video Transformer for Enhancing Low Bitrate  Streams in Real Time
This work focuses on low bitrate video streaming scenarios (e.g. 50 - 200Kbps) where the video quality is severely compromised. We present a family of novel deep generative models for enhancing perceptual video quality of such streams by performing super-resolution while also removing compression artifacts. Our model, which we call SuperTran, consumes as input a single high-quality, high-resolution reference images in addition to the low-quality, low-resolution video stream. The model thus learns how to borrow or copy visual elements like textures from the reference image and fill in the remaining details from the low resolution stream in order to produce perceptually enhanced output video. The reference frame can be sent once at the start of the video session or be retrieved from a gallery. Importantly, the resulting output has substantially better detail than what has been otherwise possible with methods that only use a low resolution input such as the SuperVEGAN method. SuperTran works in real-time (up to 30 frames/sec) on the cloud alongside standard pipelines. 

### ActiveRMAP: Radiance Field for Active Mapping And Planning
A high-quality 3D reconstruction of a scene from a collection of 2D images can be achieved through offline/online mapping methods. In this paper, we explore active mapping from the perspective of implicit representations, which have recently produced compelling results in a variety of applications. One of the most popular implicit representations - Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), first demonstrated photorealistic rendering results using multi-layer perceptrons, with promising offline 3D reconstruction as a by-product of the radiance field. More recently, researchers also applied this implicit representation for online reconstruction and localization (i.e. implicit SLAM systems). However, the study on using implicit representation for active vision tasks is still very limited. In this paper, we are particularly interested in applying the neural radiance field for active mapping and planning problems, which are closely coupled tasks in an active system. We, for the first time, present an RGB-only active vision framework using radiance field representation for active 3D reconstruction and planning in an online manner. Specifically, we formulate this joint task as an iterative dual-stage optimization problem, where we alternatively optimize for the radiance field representation and path planning. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to other offline methods and outperforms active reconstruction methods using NeRFs. 

### Integrally Pre-Trained Transformer Pyramid Networks
In this paper, we present an integral pre-training framework based on masked image modeling (MIM). We advocate for pre-training the backbone and neck jointly so that the transfer gap between MIM and downstream recognition tasks is minimal. We make two technical contributions. First, we unify the reconstruction and recognition necks by inserting a feature pyramid into the pre-training stage. Second, we complement mask image modeling (MIM) with masked feature modeling (MFM) that offers multi-stage supervision to the feature pyramid. The pre-trained models, termed integrally pre-trained transformer pyramid networks (iTPNs), serve as powerful foundation models for visual recognition. In particular, the base/large-level iTPN achieves an 86.2%/87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, a 53.2%/55.6% box AP on COCO object detection with 1x training schedule using Mask-RCNN, and a 54.7%/57.7% mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation using UPerHead -- all these results set new records. Our work inspires the community to work on unifying upstream pre-training and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Code and the pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/sunsmarterjie/iTPN. 

### RoentGen: Vision-Language Foundation Model for Chest X-ray Generation
Multimodal models trained on large natural image-text pair datasets have exhibited astounding abilities in generating high-quality images. Medical imaging data is fundamentally different to natural images, and the language used to succinctly capture relevant details in medical data uses a different, narrow but semantically rich, domain-specific vocabulary. Not surprisingly, multi-modal models trained on natural image-text pairs do not tend to generalize well to the medical domain. Developing generative imaging models faithfully representing medical concepts while providing compositional diversity could mitigate the existing paucity of high-quality, annotated medical imaging datasets. In this work, we develop a strategy to overcome the large natural-medical distributional shift by adapting a pre-trained latent diffusion model on a corpus of publicly available chest x-rays (CXR) and their corresponding radiology (text) reports. We investigate the model's ability to generate high-fidelity, diverse synthetic CXR conditioned on text prompts. We assess the model outputs quantitatively using image quality metrics, and evaluate image quality and text-image alignment by human domain experts. We present evidence that the resulting model (RoentGen) is able to create visually convincing, diverse synthetic CXR images, and that the output can be controlled to a new extent by using free-form text prompts including radiology-specific language. Fine-tuning this model on a fixed training set and using it as a data augmentation method, we measure a 5% improvement of a classifier trained jointly on synthetic and real images, and a 3% improvement when trained on a larger but purely synthetic training set. Finally, we observe that this fine-tuning distills in-domain knowledge in the text-encoder and can improve its representation capabilities of certain diseases like pneumothorax by 25%. 

### Texts as Images in Prompt Tuning for Multi-Label Image Recognition
Prompt tuning has been employed as an efficient way to adapt large vision-language pre-trained models (e.g. CLIP) to various downstream tasks in data-limited or label-limited settings. Nonetheless, visual data (e.g., images) is by default prerequisite for learning prompts in existing methods. In this work, we advocate that the effectiveness of image-text contrastive learning in aligning the two modalities (for training CLIP) further makes it feasible to treat texts as images for prompt tuning and introduce TaI prompting. In contrast to the visual data, text descriptions are easy to collect, and their class labels can be directly derived. Particularly, we apply TaI prompting to multi-label image recognition, where sentences in the wild serve as alternatives to images for prompt tuning. Moreover, with TaI, double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT) is further presented to extract both coarse-grained and fine-grained embeddings for enhancing the multi-label recognition performance. Experimental results show that our proposed TaI-DPT outperforms zero-shot CLIP by a large margin on multiple benchmarks, e.g., MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, while it can be combined with existing methods of prompting from images to improve recognition performance further. Code is released at https://github.com/guozix/TaI-DPT. 

### Completing point cloud from few points by Wasserstein GAN and  Transformers
In many vision and robotics applications, it is common that the captured objects are represented by very few points. Most of the existing completion methods are designed for partial point clouds with many points, and they perform poorly or even fail completely in the case of few points. However, due to the lack of detail information, completing objects from few points faces a huge challenge. Inspired by the successful applications of GAN and Transformers in the image-based vision task, we introduce GAN and Transformer techniques to address the above problem. Firstly, the end-to-end encoder-decoder network with Transformers and the Wasserstein GAN with Transformer are pre-trained, and then the overall network is fine-tuned. Experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset show that our method can not only improve the completion performance for many input points, but also keep stable for few input points. Our source code is available at https://github.com/WxfQjh/Stability-point-recovery.git. 

### Dynamic Appearance: A Video Representation for Action Recognition with  Joint Training
Static appearance of video may impede the ability of a deep neural network to learn motion-relevant features in video action recognition. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, Dynamic Appearance (DA), summarizing the appearance information relating to movement in a video while filtering out the static information considered unrelated to motion. We consider distilling the dynamic appearance from raw video data as a means of efficient video understanding. To this end, we propose the Pixel-Wise Temporal Projection (PWTP), which projects the static appearance of a video into a subspace within its original vector space, while the dynamic appearance is encoded in the projection residual describing a special motion pattern. Moreover, we integrate the PWTP module with a CNN or Transformer into an end-to-end training framework, which is optimized by utilizing multi-objective optimization algorithms. We provide extensive experimental results on four action recognition benchmarks: Kinetics400, Something-Something V1, UCF101 and HMDB51. 

### PANeRF: Pseudo-view Augmentation for Improved Neural Radiance Fields  Based on Few-shot Inputs
The method of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has been developed in recent years, and this technology has promising applications for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes. However, NeRF requires dense input views, typically numbering in the hundreds, for generating high-quality images. With a decrease in the number of input views, the rendering quality of NeRF for unseen viewpoints tends to degenerate drastically. To overcome this challenge, we propose pseudo-view augmentation of NeRF, a scheme that expands a sufficient amount of data by considering the geometry of few-shot inputs. We first initialized the NeRF network by leveraging the expanded pseudo-views, which efficiently minimizes uncertainty when rendering unseen views. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the network by utilizing sparse-view inputs containing precise geometry and color information. Through experiments under various settings, we verified that our model faithfully synthesizes novel-view images of superior quality and outperforms existing methods for multi-view datasets. 

### InDiReCT: Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning for Images
Common Deep Metric Learning (DML) datasets specify only one notion of similarity, e.g., two images in the Cars196 dataset are deemed similar if they show the same car model. We argue that depending on the application, users of image retrieval systems have different and changing similarity notions that should be incorporated as easily as possible. Therefore, we present Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning (LanZ-DML) as a new DML setting in which users control the properties that should be important for image representations without training data by only using natural language. To this end, we propose InDiReCT (Image representations using Dimensionality Reduction on CLIP embedded Texts), a model for LanZ-DML on images that exclusively uses a few text prompts for training. InDiReCT utilizes CLIP as a fixed feature extractor for images and texts and transfers the variation in text prompt embeddings to the image embedding space. Extensive experiments on five datasets and overall thirteen similarity notions show that, despite not seeing any images during training, InDiReCT performs better than strong baselines and approaches the performance of fully-supervised models. An analysis reveals that InDiReCT learns to focus on regions of the image that correlate with the desired similarity notion, which makes it a fast to train and easy to use method to create custom embedding spaces only using natural language. 

### VoP: Text-Video Co-operative Prompt Tuning for Cross-Modal Retrieval
Many recent studies leverage the pre-trained CLIP for text-video cross-modal retrieval by tuning the backbone with additional heavy modules, which not only brings huge computational burdens with much more parameters, but also leads to the knowledge forgetting from upstream models.In this work, we propose the VoP: Text-Video Co-operative Prompt Tuning for efficient tuning on the text-video retrieval task. The proposed VoP is an end-to-end framework with both video & text prompts introducing, which can be regarded as a powerful baseline with only 0.1% trainable parameters. Further, based on the spatio-temporal characteristics of videos, we develop three novel video prompt mechanisms to improve the performance with different scales of trainable parameters. The basic idea of the VoP enhancement is to model the frame position, frame context, and layer function with specific trainable prompts, respectively. Extensive experiments show that compared to full fine-tuning, the enhanced VoP achieves a 1.4% average R@1 gain across five text-video retrieval benchmarks with 6x less parameter overhead. The code will be available at https://github.com/bighuang624/VoP. 

### A Dual-scale Lead-seperated Transformer With Lead-orthogonal Attention  And Meta-information For Ecg Classification
Auxiliary diagnosis of cardiac electrophysiological status can be obtained through the analysis of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). This work proposes a dual-scale lead-separated transformer with lead-orthogonal attention and meta-information (DLTM-ECG) as a novel approach to address this challenge. ECG segments of each lead are interpreted as independent patches, and together with the reduced dimension signal, they form a dual-scale representation. As a method to reduce interference from segments with low correlation, two group attention mechanisms perform both lead-internal and cross-lead attention. Our method allows for the addition of previously discarded meta-information, further improving the utilization of clinical information. Experimental results show that our DLTM-ECG yields significantly better classification scores than other transformer-based models,matching or performing better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods on two benchmark datasets. Our work has the potential for similar multichannel bioelectrical signal processing and physiological multimodal tasks. 

### An ensemble of VisNet, Transformer-M, and pretraining models for  molecular property prediction in OGB Large-Scale Challenge @ NeurIPS 2022
In the technical report, we provide our solution for OGB-LSC 2022 Graph Regression Task. The target of this task is to predict the quantum chemical property, HOMO-LUMO gap for a given molecule on PCQM4Mv2 dataset. In the competition, we designed two kinds of models: Transformer-M-ViSNet which is an geometry-enhanced graph neural network for fully connected molecular graphs and Pretrained-3D-ViSNet which is a pretrained ViSNet by distilling geomeotric information from optimized structures. With an ensemble of 22 models, ViSNet Team achieved the MAE of 0.0723 eV on the test-challenge set, dramatically reducing the error by 39.75% compared with the best method in the last year competition. 

### BAD-NeRF: Bundle Adjusted Deblur Neural Radiance Fields
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have received considerable attention recently, due to its impressive capability in photo-realistic 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, given a set of posed camera images. Earlier work usually assumes the input images are in good quality. However, image degradation (e.g. image motion blur in low-light conditions) can easily happen in real-world scenarios, which would further affect the rendering quality of NeRF. In this paper, we present a novel bundle adjusted deblur Neural Radiance Fields (BAD-NeRF), which can be robust to severe motion blurred images and inaccurate camera poses. Our approach models the physical image formation process of a motion blurred image, and jointly learns the parameters of NeRF and recovers the camera motion trajectories during exposure time. In experiments, we show that by directly modeling the real physical image formation process, BAD-NeRF achieves superior performance over prior works on both synthetic and real datasets. 

### Data Augmentation Vision Transformer for Fine-grained Image  Classification
Recently, the vision transformer (ViT) has made breakthroughs in image recognition. Its self-attention mechanism (MSA) can extract discriminative labeling information of different pixel blocks to improve image classification accuracy. However, the classification marks in their deep layers tend to ignore local features between layers. In addition, the embedding layer will be fixed-size pixel blocks. Input network Inevitably introduces additional image noise. To this end, this paper studies a data augmentation vision transformer (DAVT) based on data augmentation and proposes a data augmentation method for attention cropping, which uses attention weights as the guide to crop images and improve the ability of the network to learn critical features. Secondly, this paper also proposes a hierarchical attention selection (HAS) method, which improves the ability of discriminative markers between levels of learning by filtering and fusing labels between levels. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this method on the two general datasets, CUB-200-2011, and Stanford Dogs, is better than the existing mainstream methods, and its accuracy is 1.4\% and 1.6\% higher than the original ViT, respectively. 

### Evaluating and Mitigating Static Bias of Action Representations in the  Background and the Foreground
Deep neural networks for video action recognition easily learn to utilize shortcut static features, such as background and objects instead of motion features. This results in poor generalization to atypical videos such as soccer playing on concrete surfaces (instead of soccer fields). However, due to the rarity of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, quantitative evaluation of static bias remains a difficult task. In this paper, we synthesize new sets of benchmarks to evaluate static bias of action representations, including SCUB for static cues in the background, and SCUF for static cues in the foreground. Further, we propose a simple yet effective video data augmentation technique, StillMix, that automatically identifies bias-inducing video frames; unlike similar augmentation techniques, StillMix does not need to enumerate or precisely segment biased content. With extensive experiments, we quantitatively compare and analyze existing action recognition models on the created benchmarks to reveal their characteristics. We validate the effectiveness of StillMix and show that it improves TSM (Lin, Gan, and Han 2021) and Video Swin Transformer (Liu et al. 2021) by more than 10% of accuracy on SCUB for OOD action recognition. 

### Hybrid Learning of Time-Series Inverse Dynamics Models for Locally  Isotropic Robot Motion
Applications of force control and motion planning often rely on an inverse dynamics model to represent the high-dimensional dynamic behavior of robots during motion. The widespread occurrence of low-velocity, small-scale, locally isotropic motion (LIMO) typically complicates the identification of appropriate models due to the exaggeration of dynamic effects and sensory perturbation caused by complex friction and phenomena of hysteresis, e.g., pertaining to joint elasticity. We propose a hybrid model learning base architectures combining a rigid body dynamics model identified by parametric regression and time-series neural network architectures based on multilayer-perceptron, LSTM, and Transformer topologies. Further, we introduce novel joint-wise rotational history encoding, reinforcing temporal information to effectively model dynamic hysteresis. The models are evaluated on a KUKA iiwa 14 during algorithmically generated locally isotropic movements. Together with the rotational encoding, the proposed architectures outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a magnitude of 10$^3$ yielding an RMSE of 0.14 Nm. Leveraging the hybrid structure and time-series encoding capabilities, our approach allows for accurate torque estimation, indicating its applicability in critically force-sensitive applications during motion sequences exceeding the capacity of conventional inverse dynamics models while retaining trainability in face of scarce data and explainability due to the employed physics model prior. 

### Improving Visual-textual Sentiment Analysis by Fusing Expert Features
Visual-textual sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiment with the input of a pair of image and text. The main challenge of visual-textual sentiment analysis is how to learn effective visual features for sentiment prediction since input images are often very diverse. To address this challenge, we propose a new method that improves visual-textual sentiment analysis by introducing powerful expert visual features. The proposed method consists of four parts: (1) a visual-textual branch to learn features directly from data for sentiment analysis, (2) a visual expert branch with a set of pre-trained "expert" encoders to extract effective visual features, (3) a CLIP branch to implicitly model visual-textual correspondence, and (4) a multimodal feature fusion network based on either BERT or MLP to fuse multimodal features and make sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method produces better visual-textual sentiment analysis performance than existing methods. 

### Sarcasm Detection Framework Using Emotion and Sentiment Features
Sarcasm detection is an essential task that can help identify the actual sentiment in user-generated data, such as discussion forums or tweets. Sarcasm is a sophisticated form of linguistic expression because its surface meaning usually contradicts its inner, deeper meaning. Such incongruity is the essential component of sarcasm, however, it makes sarcasm detection quite a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a model which incorporates emotion and sentiment features to capture the incongruity intrinsic to sarcasm. Moreover, we use CNN and pre-trained Transformer to capture context features. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on four datasets from social networking platforms and online media. 

### TransVCL: Attention-enhanced Video Copy Localization Network with  Flexible Supervision
Video copy localization aims to precisely localize all the copied segments within a pair of untrimmed videos in video retrieval applications. Previous methods typically start from frame-to-frame similarity matrix generated by cosine similarity between frame-level features of the input video pair, and then detect and refine the boundaries of copied segments on similarity matrix under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose TransVCL: an attention-enhanced video copy localization network, which is optimized directly from initial frame-level features and trained end-to-end with three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for similarity matrix generation, and a temporal alignment module for copied segments localization. In contrast to previous methods demanding the handcrafted similarity matrix, TransVCL incorporates long-range temporal information between feature sequence pair using self- and cross- attention layers. With the joint design and optimization of three components, the similarity matrix can be learned to present more discriminative copied patterns, leading to significant improvements over previous methods on segment-level labeled datasets (VCSL and VCDB). Besides the state-of-the-art performance in fully supervised setting, the attention architecture facilitates TransVCL to further exploit unlabeled or simply video-level labeled data. Additional experiments of supplementing video-level labeled datasets including SVD and FIVR reveal the high flexibility of TransVCL from full supervision to semi-supervision (with or without video-level annotation). Code is publicly available at https://github.com/transvcl/TransVCL. 

### Schrödinger's Bat: Diffusion Models Sometimes Generate Polysemous  Words in Superposition
Recent work has shown that despite their impressive capabilities, text-to-image diffusion models such as DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022) can display strange behaviours when a prompt contains a word with multiple possible meanings, often generating images containing both senses of the word (Rassin et al., 2022). In this work we seek to put forward a possible explanation of this phenomenon. Using the similar Stable Diffusion model (Rombach et al., 2022), we first show that when given an input that is the sum of encodings of two distinct words, the model can produce an image containing both concepts represented in the sum. We then demonstrate that the CLIP encoder used to encode prompts (Radford et al., 2021) encodes polysemous words as a superposition of meanings, and that using linear algebraic techniques we can edit these representations to influence the senses represented in the generated images. Combining these two findings, we suggest that the homonym duplication phenomenon described by Rassin et al. (2022) is caused by diffusion models producing images representing both of the meanings that are present in superposition in the encoding of a polysemous word. 

### ASiT: Audio Spectrogram vIsion Transformer for General Audio  Representation
Vision transformers, which were originally developed for natural language processing, have recently generated significant interest in the computer vision and audio communities due to their flexibility in learning long-range relationships. Constrained by data hungry nature of transformers and limited labelled data most transformer-based models for audio tasks are finetuned from ImageNet pretrained models, despite the huge gap between the natural images domain and audio domain. This has motivated the research in self-supervised pretraining of audio transformers, which reduces the dependency on large amounts of labeled data and focuses on extracting concise representation of the audio spectrograms. In this paper, we propose ASiT, a novel self-supervised transformer for general audio representations that captures local and global contextual information employing group masked model learning and self-distillation. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks including audio event classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies, including evaluations of different pretraining strategies. The proposed ASiT framework significantly boosts the performance on all tasks and sets a new state-of-the-art performance on five audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming recent methods, including the approaches that use additional datasets for pretraining. The code and pretrained weights will be made publicly available for the scientific community. 

### Lite-Mono: A Lightweight CNN and Transformer Architecture for  Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation
Self-supervised monocular depth estimation that does not require ground-truth for training has attracted attention in recent years. It is of high interest to design lightweight but effective models, so that they can be deployed on edge devices. Many existing architectures benefit from using heavier backbones at the expense of model sizes. In this paper we achieve comparable results with a lightweight architecture. Specifically, we investigate the efficient combination of CNNs and Transformers, and design a hybrid architecture Lite-Mono. A Consecutive Dilated Convolutions (CDC) module and a Local-Global Features Interaction (LGFI) module are proposed. The former is used to extract rich multi-scale local features, and the latter takes advantage of the self-attention mechanism to encode long-range global information into the features. Experiments demonstrate that our full model outperforms Monodepth2 by a large margin in accuracy, with about 80% fewer trainable parameters. 

### Inversion-Based Creativity Transfer with Diffusion Models
In this paper, we introduce the task of "Creativity Transfer". The artistic creativity within a painting is the means of expression, which includes not only the painting material, colors, and brushstrokes, but also the high-level attributes including semantic elements, object shape, etc. Previous arbitrary example-guided artistic image generation methods (e.g., style transfer) often fail to control shape changes or convey semantic elements. The pre-trained text-to-image synthesis diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable quality, but they often require extensive textual descriptions to accurately portray attributes of a particular painting. We believe that the uniqueness of an artwork lies precisely in the fact that it cannot be adequately explained with normal language. Our key idea is to learn artistic creativity directly from a single painting and then guide the synthesis without providing complex textual descriptions. Specifically, we assume creativity as a learnable textual description of a painting. We propose an attention-based inversion method, which can efficiently and accurately learn the holistic and detailed information of an image, thus capturing the complete artistic creativity of a painting. We demonstrate the quality and efficiency of our method on numerous paintings of various artists and styles. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zyxElsa/creativity-transfer. 

### ManVatar : Fast 3D Head Avatar Reconstruction Using Motion-Aware Neural  Voxels
With NeRF widely used for facial reenactment, recent methods can recover photo-realistic 3D head avatar from just a monocular video. Unfortunately, the training process of the NeRF-based methods is quite time-consuming, as MLP used in the NeRF-based methods is inefficient and requires too many iterations to converge. To overcome this problem, we propose ManVatar, a fast 3D head avatar reconstruction method using Motion-Aware Neural Voxels. ManVatar is the first to decouple expression motion from canonical appearance for head avatar, and model the expression motion by neural voxels. In particular, the motion-aware neural voxels is generated from the weighted concatenation of multiple 4D tensors. The 4D tensors semantically correspond one-to-one with 3DMM expression bases and share the same weights as 3DMM expression coefficients. Benefiting from our novel representation, the proposed ManVatar can recover photo-realistic head avatars in just 5 minutes (implemented with pure PyTorch), which is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art facial reenactment methods. 

### CODA-Prompt: COntinual Decomposed Attention-based Prompting for  Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning
Computer vision models suffer from a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting when learning novel concepts from continuously shifting training data. Typical solutions for this continual learning problem require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data, which increases memory costs and may violate data privacy. Recently, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision transformer models has enabled prompting approaches as an alternative to data-rehearsal. These approaches rely on a key-query mechanism to generate prompts and have been found to be highly resistant to catastrophic forgetting in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting. However, the key mechanism of these methods is not trained end-to-end with the task sequence. Our experiments show that this leads to a reduction in their plasticity, hence sacrificing new task accuracy, and inability to benefit from expanded parameter capacity. We instead propose to learn a set of prompt components which are assembled with input-conditioned weights to produce input-conditioned prompts, resulting in a novel attention-based end-to-end key-query scheme. Our experiments show that we outperform the current SOTA method DualPrompt on established benchmarks by as much as 5.4% in average accuracy. We also outperform the state of art by as much as 6.6% accuracy on a continual learning benchmark which contains both class-incremental and domain-incremental task shifts, corresponding to many practical settings. 

### Tetrahedral Diffusion Models for 3D Shape Generation
Recently, probabilistic denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have greatly advanced the generative power of neural networks. DDMs, inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have not only been used for 2D image generation, but can also readily be applied to 3D point clouds. However, representing 3D shapes as point clouds has a number of drawbacks, most obvious perhaps that they have no notion of topology or connectivity. Here, we explore an alternative route and introduce tetrahedral diffusion models, an extension of DDMs to tetrahedral partitions of 3D space. The much more structured 3D representation with space-filling tetrahedra makes it possible to guide and regularize the diffusion process and to apply it to colorized assets. To manipulate the proposed representation, we develop tetrahedral convolutions, down- and up-sampling kernels. With those operators, 3D shape generation amounts to learning displacement vectors and signed distance values on the tetrahedral grid. Our experiments confirm that Tetrahedral Diffusion yields plausible, visually pleasing and diverse 3D shapes, is able to handle surface attributes like color, and can be guided at test time to manipulate the resulting shapes. 

### Latent Video Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Video Generation with  Arbitrary Lengths
AI-generated content has attracted lots of attention recently, but photo-realistic video synthesis is still challenging. Although many attempts using GANs and autoregressive models have been made in this area, the visual quality and length of generated videos are far from satisfactory. Diffusion models (DMs) are another class of deep generative models and have recently achieved remarkable performance on various image synthesis tasks. However, training image diffusion models usually requires substantial computational resources to achieve a high performance, which makes expanding diffusion models to high-dimensional video synthesis tasks more computationally expensive. To ease this problem while leveraging its advantages, we introduce lightweight video diffusion models that synthesize high-fidelity and arbitrary-long videos from pure noise. Specifically, we propose to perform diffusion and denoising in a low-dimensional 3D latent space, which significantly outperforms previous methods on 3D pixel space when under a limited computational budget. In addition, though trained on tens of frames, our models can generate videos with arbitrary lengths, i.e., thousands of frames, in an autoregressive way. Finally, conditional latent perturbation is further introduced to reduce performance degradation during synthesizing long-duration videos. Extensive experiments on various datasets and generated lengths suggest that our framework is able to sample much more realistic and longer videos than previous approaches, including GAN-based, autoregressive-based, and diffusion-based methods. 

### SVFormer: Semi-supervised Video Transformer for Action Recognition
Semi-supervised action recognition is a challenging but critical task due to the high cost of video annotations. Existing approaches mainly use convolutional neural networks, yet current revolutionary vision transformer models have been less explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of transformer models under the SSL setting for action recognition. To this end, we introduce SVFormer, which adopts a steady pseudo-labeling framework (ie, EMA-Teacher) to cope with unlabeled video samples. While a wide range of data augmentations have been shown effective for semi-supervised image classification, they generally produce limited results for video recognition. We therefore introduce a novel augmentation strategy, Tube TokenMix, tailored for video data where video clips are mixed via a mask with consistent masked tokens over the temporal axis. In addition, we propose a temporal warping augmentation to cover the complex temporal variation in videos, which stretches selected frames to various temporal durations in the clip. Extensive experiments on three datasets Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 verify the advantage of SVFormer. In particular, SVFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art by 31.5% with fewer training epochs under the 1% labeling rate of Kinetics-400. Our method can hopefully serve as a strong benchmark and encourage future search on semi-supervised action recognition with Transformer networks. 

### Peekaboo: Text to Image Diffusion Models are Zero-Shot Segmentors
Recent diffusion-based generative models combined with vision-language models are capable of creating realistic images from natural language prompts. While these models are trained on large internet-scale datasets, such pre-trained models are not directly introduced to any semantic localization or grounding. Most current approaches for localization or grounding rely on human-annotated localization information in the form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks. The exceptions are a few unsupervised methods that utilize architectures or loss functions geared towards localization, but they need to be trained separately. In this work, we explore how off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained with no exposure to such localization information, are capable of grounding various semantic phrases with no segmentation-specific re-training. An inference time optimization process is introduced, that is capable of generating segmentation masks conditioned on natural language. We evaluate our proposal Peekaboo for unsupervised semantic segmentation on the Pascal VOC dataset. In addition, we evaluate for referring segmentation on the RefCOCO dataset. In summary, we present a first zero-shot, open-vocabulary, unsupervised (no localization information), semantic grounding technique leveraging diffusion-based generative models with no re-training. Our code will be released publicly. 

### ClimateNeRF: Physically-based Neural Rendering for Extreme Climate  Synthesis
Physical simulations produce excellent predictions of weather effects. Neural radiance fields produce SOTA scene models. We describe a novel NeRF-editing procedure that can fuse physical simulations with NeRF models of scenes, producing realistic movies of physical phenomena inthose scenes. Our application -- Climate NeRF -- allows people to visualize what climate change outcomes will do to them. ClimateNeRF allows us to render realistic weather effects, including smog, snow, and flood. Results can be controlled with physically meaningful variables like water level. Qualitative and quantitative studies show that our simulated results are significantly more realistic than those from state-of-the-art 2D image editing and 3D NeRF stylization. 

### Paint by Example: Exemplar-based Image Editing with Diffusion Models
Language-guided image editing has achieved great success recently. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate exemplar-guided image editing for more precise control. We achieve this goal by leveraging self-supervised training to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar. However, the naive approach will cause obvious fusing artifacts. We carefully analyze it and propose an information bottleneck and strong augmentations to avoid the trivial solution of directly copying and pasting the exemplar image. Meanwhile, to ensure the controllability of the editing process, we design an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leverage the classifier-free guidance to increase the similarity to the exemplar image. The whole framework involves a single forward of the diffusion model without any iterative optimization. We demonstrate that our method achieves an impressive performance and enables controllable editing on in-the-wild images with high fidelity.
