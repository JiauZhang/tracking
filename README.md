        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Controlling agents remotely with deep reinforcement learning~(DRL) in the real world is yet to come. One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments. Our approach offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world environments with limited or unreliable data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural networks have complex structures, and thus it is hard to understand their inner workings and ensure correctness. To understand and debug convolutional neural networks (CNNs) we propose techniques for testing the channels of CNNs. We design FtGAN, an extension to GAN, that can generate test data with varying the intensity (i.e., sum of the neurons) of a channel of a target CNN. We also proposed a channel selection algorithm to find representative channels for testing. To efficiently inspect the target CNN's inference computations, we define unexpectedness score, which estimates how similar the inference computation of the test data is to that of the training data. We evaluated FtGAN with five public datasets and showed that our techniques successfully identify defective channels in five different CNN models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Microstructure reconstruction is an important and emerging field of research and an essential foundation to improving inverse computational materials engineering (ICME). Much of the recent progress in the field is made based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Although excellent results have been achieved throughout a variety of materials, challenges remain regarding the interpretability of the model's latent space as well as the applicability to extremely small data sets. The present work addresses these issues by introducing DA-VEGAN, a model with two central innovations. First, a $\beta$-variational autoencoder is incorporated into a hybrid GAN architecture that allows to penalize strong nonlinearities in the latent space by an additional parameter, $\beta$. Secondly, a custom differentiable data augmentation scheme is developed specifically for this architecture. The differentiability allows the model to learn from extremely small data sets without mode collapse or deteriorated sample quality. An extensive validation on a variety of structures demonstrates the potential of the method and future directions of investigation are discussed. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We examine whether large neural language models, trained on very large collections of varied English text, learn the potentially long-distance dependency of British versus American spelling conventions, i.e., whether spelling is consistently one or the other within model-generated strings. In contrast to long-distance dependencies in non-surface underlying structure (e.g., syntax), spelling consistency is easier to measure both in LMs and the text corpora used to train them, which can provide additional insight into certain observed model behaviors. Using a set of probe words unique to either British or American English, we first establish that training corpora exhibit substantial (though not total) consistency. A large T5 language model does appear to internalize this consistency, though only with respect to observed lexical items (not nonce words with British/American spelling patterns). We further experiment with correcting for biases in the training data by fine-tuning T5 on synthetic data that has been debiased, and find that finetuned T5 remains only somewhat sensitive to spelling consistency. Further experiments show GPT2 to be similarly limited. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a composable framework for latent space image augmentation that allows for easy combination of multiple augmentations. Image augmentation has been shown to be an effective technique for improving the performance of a wide variety of image classification and generation tasks. Our framework is based on the Variational Autoencoder architecture and uses a novel approach for augmentation via linear transformation within the latent space itself. We explore losses and augmentation latent geometry to enforce the transformations to be composable and involuntary, thus allowing the transformations to be readily combined or inverted. Finally, we show these properties are better performing with certain pairs of augmentations, but we can transfer the latent space to other sets of augmentations to modify performance, effectively constraining the VAE's bottleneck to preserve the variance of specific augmentations and features of the image which we care about. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with initial results on the MNIST dataset against both a standard VAE and a Conditional VAE. This latent augmentation method allows for much greater control and geometric interpretability of the latent space, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present LGX, a novel algorithm for Object Goal Navigation in a "language-driven, zero-shot manner", where an embodied agent navigates to an arbitrarily described target object in a previously unexplored environment. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for making navigational decisions by mapping the LLMs implicit knowledge about the semantic context of the environment into sequential inputs for robot motion planning. Simultaneously, we also conduct generalized target object detection using a pre-trained Vision-Language grounding model. We achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot object navigation results on RoboTHOR with a success rate (SR) improvement of over 27% over the current baseline of the OWL-ViT CLIP on Wheels (OWL CoW). Furthermore, we study the usage of LLMs for robot navigation and present an analysis of the various semantic factors affecting model output. Finally, we showcase the benefits of our approach via real-world experiments that indicate the superior performance of LGX when navigating to and detecting visually unique objects. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fast and accurate climate simulations and weather predictions are critical for understanding and preparing for the impact of climate change. Real-world weather and climate modeling consist of compound stencil kernels that do not perform well on conventional architectures. Horizontal diffusion is one such important compound stencil found in many regional global climate and weather prediction models. Recent works propose using FPGAs as an alternative to traditional CPU and GPU-based systems to accelerate weather stencil kernels. However, we observe that compound stencil computations cannot leverage the bit-level flexibility available on an FPGA because of its complex memory access patterns, leading to high resource utilization and low peak performance. We introduce SPARTA, a novel spatial accelerator for horizontal diffusion weather stencil computation. We exploit the two-dimensional spatial architecture to efficiently accelerate horizontal diffusion stencil by designing the first scaled-out spatial accelerator using MLIR (multi-level intermediate representation) compiler framework. We evaluate its performance on a real cutting-edge AMD-Xilinx Versal AI Engine (AIE) spatial architecture. Our real-system evaluation results demonstrate that SPARTA outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU, GPU, and FPGA implementations by 17.1x, 1.2x, and 2.1x, respectively. Our results reveal that balancing workload across the available processing resources is crucial in achieving high performance on spatial architectures. We also implement and evaluate five elementary stencils that are commonly used as benchmarks for stencil computation research. We freely open-source all our implementations to aid in future research in stencil computation and spatial computing systems at: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SPARTA. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Indoor scene synthesis involves automatically picking and placing furniture appropriately on a floor plan, so that the scene looks realistic and is functionally plausible. Such scenes can serve as a home for immersive 3D experiences, or be used to train embodied agents. Existing methods for this task rely on labeled categories of furniture, e.g. bed, chair or table, to generate contextually relevant combinations of furniture. Whether heuristic or learned, these methods ignore instance-level attributes of objects such as color and style, and as a result may produce visually less coherent scenes. In this paper, we introduce an auto-regressive scene model which can output instance-level predictions, making use of general purpose image embedding based on CLIP. This allows us to learn visual correspondences such as matching color and style, and produce more plausible and aesthetically pleasing scenes. Evaluated on the 3D-FRONT dataset, our model achieves SOTA results in scene generation and improves auto-completion metrics by over 50%. Moreover, our embedding-based approach enables zero-shot text-guided scene generation and editing, which easily generalizes to furniture not seen at training time. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose Adversarial DEep Learning Transpiler (ADELT) for source-to-source transpilation between deep learning frameworks. Unlike prior approaches, we decouple the transpilation of code skeletons and the mapping of API keywords (an API function name or a parameter name). ADELT transpile code skeletons using few-shot prompting on big language models. Based on contextual embeddings extracted by a BERT for code, we train aligned API embeddings in a domain-adversarial setup, upon which we generate a dictionary for keyword translation. The model is trained on our unlabeled DL corpus from web crawl data, without using any hand-crafted rules and parallel data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art transpilers on multiple transpilation pairs including PyTorch-Keras and PyTorch-MXNet by 15.9pts and 12.0pts in exact match scores respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The goal of Image-to-image (I2I) translation is to transfer an image from a source domain to a target domain, which has recently drawn increasing attention. One major branch of this research is to formulate I2I translation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). As a zero-sum game, GAN can be reformulated as a Partially-observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) for generators, where generators cannot access full state information of their environments. This formulation illustrates the information insufficiency in the GAN training. To mitigate this problem, we propose to add a communication channel between discriminators and generators. We explore multiple architecture designs to integrate the communication mechanism into the I2I translation framework. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. The experimental results confirm the superiority of our proposed method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations are tremendously useful for perception-related automated driving tasks. However, generating BEVs from surround-view fisheye camera images is challenging due to the strong distortions introduced by such wide-angle lenses. We take the first step in addressing this challenge and introduce a baseline, F2BEV, to generate BEV height maps and semantic segmentation maps from fisheye images. F2BEV consists of a distortion-aware spatial cross attention module for querying and consolidating spatial information from fisheye image features in a transformer-style architecture followed by a task-specific head. We evaluate single-task and multi-task variants of F2BEV on our synthetic FB-SSEM dataset, all of which generate better BEV height and segmentation maps (in terms of the IoU) than a state-of-the-art BEV generation method operating on undistorted fisheye images. We also demonstrate height map generation from real-world fisheye images using F2BEV.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We develop new multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods to estimate the expectation of the smallest eigenvalue of a stochastic convection-diffusion operator with random coefficients. The MLMC method is based on a sequence of finite element (FE) discretizations of the eigenvalue problem on a hierarchy of increasingly finer meshes. For the discretized, algebraic eigenproblems we use both the Rayleigh quotient (RQ) iteration and implicitly restarted Arnoldi (IRA), providing an analysis of the cost in each case. By studying the variance on each level and adapting classical FE error bounds to the stochastic setting, we are able to bound the total error of our MLMC estimator and provide a complexity analysis. As expected, the complexity bound for our MLMC estimator is superior to plain Monte Carlo. To improve the efficiency of the MLMC further, we exploit the hierarchy of meshes and use coarser approximations as starting values for the eigensolvers on finer ones. To improve the stability of the MLMC method for convection-dominated problems, we employ two additional strategies. First, we consider the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin formulation of the discrete eigenvalue problem, which allows us to start the MLMC method on coarser meshes than is possible with standard FEs. Second, we apply a homotopy method to obtain the eigenvalue of the convection-diffusion operator by following a continuous path starting from the pure diffusion operator. We provide detailed numerical results comparing our different strategies to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the MLMC method in different use cases. The results support our complexity analysis and further demonstrate the superiority over plain Monte Carlo in all cases. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Motion, scene and object are three primary visual components of a video. In particular, objects represent the foreground, scenes represent the background, and motion traces their dynamics. Based on this insight, we propose a two-stage MOtion, Scene and Object decomposition framework (MOSO) for video prediction, consisting of MOSO-VQVAE and MOSO-Transformer. In the first stage, MOSO-VQVAE decomposes a previous video clip into the motion, scene and object components, and represents them as distinct groups of discrete tokens. Then, in the second stage, MOSO-Transformer predicts the object and scene tokens of the subsequent video clip based on the previous tokens and adds dynamic motion at the token level to the generated object and scene tokens. Our framework can be easily extended to unconditional video generation and video frame interpolation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional video generation: BAIR, RoboNet, KTH, KITTI and UCF101. In addition, MOSO can produce realistic videos by combining objects and scenes from different videos. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present Flow-Guided Density Ratio Learning (FDRL), a simple and scalable approach to generative modeling which builds on the stale (time-independent) approximation of the gradient flow of entropy-regularized f-divergences introduced in DGflow. In DGflow, the intractable time-dependent density ratio is approximated by a stale estimator given by a GAN discriminator. This is sufficient in the case of sample refinement, where the source and target distributions of the flow are close to each other. However, this assumption is invalid for generation and a naive application of the stale estimator fails due to the large chasm between the two distributions. FDRL proposes to train a density ratio estimator such that it learns from progressively improving samples during the training process. We show that this simple method alleviates the density chasm problem, allowing FDRL to generate images of dimensions as high as $128\times128$, as well as outperform existing gradient flow baselines on quantitative benchmarks. We also show the flexibility of FDRL with two use cases. First, unconditional FDRL can be easily composed with external classifiers to perform class-conditional generation.

Compared to other freely available datasets tested, it has an above-average duration and, in addition, meets the technical and legal requirements for industrial assembly lines. Furthermore, the dataset contains occlusions, hand-object interaction, and various fine-grained human hand actions for industrial assembly tasks that were not found in combination in examined datasets. The recorded ground truth assembly classes were selected after extensive observation of real-world use cases. A Gated Transformer Network, a state-of-the-art model from the transformer domain was adapted, and proved with a test accuracy of 86.25% before hyperparameter tuning by 18,269,959 trainable parameters, that it is possible to train sequential deep learning models with this dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer has shown advanced performance in speech separation, benefiting from its ability to capture global features. However, capturing local features and channel information of audio sequences in speech separation is equally important. In this paper, we present a novel approach named Intra-SE-Conformer and Inter-Transformer (ISCIT) for speech separation. Specifically, we design a new network SE-Conformer that can model audio sequences in multiple dimensions and scales, and apply it to the dual-path speech separation framework. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Block Feature Aggregation to improve the separation effect by selectively utilizing information from the intermediate blocks of the separation network. Meanwhile, we propose a speaker similarity discriminative loss to optimize the speech separation model to address the problem of poor performance when speakers have similar voices. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets WSJ0-2mix and WHAM! show that ISCIT can achieve state-of-the-art results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Piano fingering -- knowing which finger to use to play each note in a musical piece, is a hard and important skill to master when learning to play the piano. While some sheet music is available with expert-annotated fingering information, most pieces lack this information, and people often resort to learning the fingering from demonstrations in online videos. We consider the AI task of automating the extraction of fingering information from videos. This is a non-trivial task as fingers are often occluded by other fingers, and it is often not clear from the video which of the keys were pressed, requiring the synchronization of hand position information and knowledge about the notes that were played. We show how to perform this task with high-accuracy using a combination of deep-learning modules, including a GAN-based approach for fine-tuning on out-of-domain data. We extract the fingering information with an f1 score of 97\%. We run the resulting system on 90 videos, resulting in high-quality piano fingering information of 150K notes, the largest available dataset of piano-fingering to date. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging task, whose objective is to learn policies from static trajectory data without interacting with the environment. Recently, offline RL has been viewed as a sequence modeling problem, where an agent generates a sequence of subsequent actions based on a set of static transition experiences. However, existing approaches that use transformers to attend to all tokens naively can overlook the dependencies between different tokens and limit long-term dependency learning. In this paper, we propose the Graph Decision Transformer (GDT), a novel offline RL approach that models the input sequence into a causal graph to capture potential dependencies between fundamentally different concepts and facilitate temporal and causal relationship learning. GDT uses a graph transformer to process the graph inputs with relation-enhanced mechanisms, and an optional sequence transformer to handle fine-grained spatial information in visual tasks. Our experiments show that GDT matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL methods on image-based Atari and OpenAI Gym. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we focus on a novel optimization problem in which the objective function is a black-box and can only be evaluated through a ranking oracle. This problem is common in real-world applications, particularly in cases where the function is assessed by human judges. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a prominent example of such an application, which is adopted by the recent works \cite{ouyang2022training,liu2023languages,chatgpt,bai2022training} to improve the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human guidance. We propose ZO-RankSGD, a first-of-its-kind zeroth-order optimization algorithm, to solve this optimization problem with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, our algorithm employs a new rank-based random estimator for the descent direction and is proven to converge to a stationary point. ZO-RankSGD can also be directly applied to the policy search problem in reinforcement learning when only a ranking oracle of the episode reward is available. This makes ZO-RankSGD a promising alternative to existing RLHF methods, as it optimizes in an online fashion and thus can work without any pre-collected data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers an effective approach for aligning human and machine intentions in a wide range of domains.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generating visual layouts is an essential ingredient of graphic design. The ability to condition layout generation on a partial subset of component attributes is critical to real-world applications that involve user interaction. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated high-quality generative performances in various domains. However, it is unclear how to apply diffusion models to the natural representation of layouts which consists of a mix of discrete (class) and continuous (location, size) attributes. To address the conditioning layout generation problem, we introduce DLT, a joint discrete-continuous diffusion model. DLT is a transformer-based model which has a flexible conditioning mechanism that allows for conditioning on any given subset of all the layout component classes, locations, and sizes. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on various layout generation datasets with respect to different metrics and conditioning settings. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed conditioning mechanism and the joint continuous-diffusion process. This joint process can be incorporated into a wide range of mixed discrete-continuous generative tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative transformers have shown their superiority in synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution images, such as good diversity and training stability. However, they suffer from the problem of slow generation since they need to generate a long token sequence autoregressively. To better accelerate the generative transformers while keeping good generation quality, we propose Lformer, a semi-autoregressive text-to-image generation model. Lformer firstly encodes an image into $h{\times}h$ discrete tokens, then divides these tokens into $h$ mirrored L-shape blocks from the top left to the bottom right and decodes the tokens in a block parallelly in each step. Lformer predicts the area adjacent to the previous context like autoregressive models thus it is more stable while accelerating. By leveraging the 2D structure of image tokens, Lformer achieves faster speed than the existing transformer-based methods while keeping good generation quality. Moreover, the pretrained Lformer can edit images without the requirement for finetuning. We can roll back to the early steps for regeneration or edit the image with a bounding box and a text prompt. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The aim of this work is to construct efficient finite volume schemes for the numerical study of sediment transport in shallow water, in the framework of the Exner model.In most cases, the velocity related to the sediment is much lower that the fluid velocity, which, in turn, may be much lower that the free-surface wave speed. Explicit methods that resolve all waves require small time steps due to the CFL stability restriction because of fast surface waves. Furthermore, if Rusanov flux is adopted, slow sediment waves may be affected by the large numerical diffusion. The objective of the present work is to drastically improve the efficiency in the computation of the evolution of the sediment by treating water waves implicitly, thus allowing much larger time steps than the one required by fully explicit schemes. The goal is reached by suitably semi-implicit schemes obtained by the use of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Rendering novel views from captured multi-view images has made considerable progress since the emergence of the neural radiance field. This paper aims to further advance the quality of view rendering by proposing a novel approach dubbed the neural radiance feature field (NRFF) which represents scenes in the feature space. We first propose a multiscale tensor decomposition scheme to organize learnable features so as to represent scenes from coarse to fine scales. We demonstrate many benefits of the proposed multiscale representation, including more accurate scene shape and appearance reconstruction, and faster convergence compared with the single-scale representation. Instead of encoding view directions to model view-dependent effects, we further propose to encode the rendering equation in the feature space by employing the anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixture predicted from the proposed multiscale representation. The proposed NRFF improves state-of-the-art rendering results by over 1 dB in PSNR on both the NeRF and NSVF synthetic datasets. A significant improvement has also been observed on the real-world Tanks and Temples dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Model-based methods provide an effective approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL). They learn an environmental dynamics model from interaction experiences and then perform policy optimization based on the learned model. However, previous model-based offline RL methods lack long-term prediction capability, resulting in large errors when generating multi-step trajectories. We address this issue by developing a sequence modeling architecture, Environment Transformer, which can generate reliable long-horizon trajectories based on offline datasets. We then propose a novel model-based offline RL algorithm, ENTROPY, that learns the dynamics model and reward function by ENvironment TRansformer and performs Offline PolicY optimization. We evaluate the proposed method on MuJoCo continuous control RL environments. Results show that ENTROPY performs comparably or better than the state-of-the-art model-based and model-free offline RL methods and demonstrates more powerful long-term trajectory prediction capability compared to existing model-based offline methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As a popular stabilization technique, the nonsymmetric interior penalty Galerkin (NIPG) method has significant application value in computational fluid dynamics. In this paper, we study the NIPG method for a typical two-dimensional singularly perturbed convection diffusion problem on a Shishkin mesh. According to the characteristics of the solution, the mesh and numerical scheme, a new composite interpolation is introduced. In fact, this interpolation is composed of a vertices-edges-element interpolation within the layer and a local $L^{2}$-projection outside the layer. On the basis of that, by selecting penalty parameters on different types of interelement edges, we further obtain the supercloseness of almost $k+\frac{1}{2}$ order in an energy norm. Here $k$ is the degree of piecewise polynomials. Numerical tests support our theoretical conclusion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Event extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and extracting information about events mentioned in text. However, it is a challenging task due to the lack of annotated data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT provides an opportunity to solve language tasks with simple prompts without the need for task-specific datasets and fine-tuning. While ChatGPT has demonstrated impressive results in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering, it presents challenges when used for complex tasks like event extraction. Unlike other tasks, event extraction requires the model to be provided with a complex set of instructions defining all event types and their schemas. To explore the feasibility of ChatGPT for event extraction and the challenges it poses, we conducted a series of experiments. Our results show that ChatGPT has, on average, only 51.04% of the performance of a task-specific model such as EEQA in long-tail and complex scenarios. Our usability testing experiments indicate that ChatGPT is not robust enough, and continuous refinement of the prompt does not lead to stable performance improvements, which can result in a poor user experience. Besides, ChatGPT is highly sensitive to different prompt styles. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study how in-context learning (ICL) in language models is affected by semantic priors versus input-label mappings. We investigate two setups-ICL with flipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model families (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments on ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent ability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels presented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from pretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with in-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic priors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label ICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs (e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models to learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to perform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale, and large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a SUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that instruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity to learn input-label mappings, but more of the former. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Event cameras are neuromorphic vision sensors representing visual information as sparse and asynchronous event streams. Most state-of-the-art event-based methods project events into dense frames and process them with conventional learning models. However, these approaches sacrifice the sparsity and high temporal resolution of event data, resulting in a large model size and high computational complexity. To fit the sparse nature of events and sufficiently explore their implicit relationship, we develop a novel attention-aware framework named Event Voxel Set Transformer (EVSTr) for spatiotemporal representation learning on event streams. It first converts the event stream into a voxel set and then hierarchically aggregates voxel features to obtain robust representations. The core of EVSTr is an event voxel transformer encoder to extract discriminative spatiotemporal features, which consists of two well-designed components, including a multi-scale neighbor embedding layer (MNEL) for local information aggregation and a voxel self-attention layer (VSAL) for global representation modeling. Enabling the framework to incorporate a long-term temporal structure, we introduce a segmental consensus strategy for modeling motion patterns over a sequence of segmented voxel sets. We evaluate the proposed framework on two event-based tasks: object classification and action recognition. Comprehensive experiments show that EVSTr achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low model complexity. Additionally, we present a new dataset (NeuroHAR) recorded in challenging visual scenarios to address the lack of real-world event-based datasets for action recognition. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Given AI systems like ChatGPT can generate content that is indistinguishable from human-made work, the responsible use of this technology is a growing concern. Although understanding the benefits and harms of using AI systems requires more time, their rapid and indiscriminate adoption in practice is a reality. Currently, we lack a common framework and language to define and report responsible use of AI for content generation. Prior work proposed guidelines for using AI in specific scenarios (e.g., robotics or medicine) which are not transferable to conducting and reporting scientific research. Our work makes two contributions: First, we propose a three-dimensional model consisting of transparency, integrity, and accountability to \textit{define} the responsible use of AI. Second, we introduce ``AI Usage Cards'', a standardized way to \textit{report} the use of AI in scientific research.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Today we have a good theoretical understanding of the representational power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). For example, their limitations have been characterized in relation to a hierarchy of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism tests. However, we do not know what is encoded in the learned representations. This is our main question. We answer it using a probing framework to quantify the amount of meaningful information captured in graph representations. Our findings on molecular datasets show the potential of probing for understanding the inductive biases of graph-based models. We compare different families of models and show that transformer-based models capture more chemically relevant information compared to models based on message passing. We also study the effect of different design choices such as skip connections and virtual nodes. We advocate for probing as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating graph-based models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: ChatGPT has shown strong capabilities in natural language generation tasks, which naturally leads researchers to explore where its abilities end. In this paper, we examine whether ChatGPT can be used for zero-shot text classification, more specifically, automatic genre identification. We compare ChatGPT with a multilingual XLM-RoBERTa language model that was fine-tuned on datasets, manually annotated with genres. The models are compared on test sets in two languages: English and Slovenian. Results show that ChatGPT outperforms the fine-tuned model when applied to the dataset which was not seen before by either of the models. Even when applied on Slovenian language as an under-resourced language, ChatGPT's performance is no worse than when applied to English. However, if the model is fully prompted in Slovenian, the performance drops significantly, showing the current limitations of ChatGPT usage on smaller languages. The presented results lead us to questioning whether this is the beginning of an end of laborious manual annotation campaigns even for smaller languages, such as Slovenian. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a learning framework for reconstructing neural scene representations from a small number of unconstrained tourist photos. Since each image contains transient occluders, decomposing the static and transient components is necessary to construct radiance fields with such in-the-wild photographs where existing methods require a lot of training data. We introduce SF-NeRF, aiming to disentangle those two components with only a few images given, which exploits semantic information without any supervision. The proposed method contains an occlusion filtering module that predicts the transient color and its opacity for each pixel, which enables the NeRF model to solely learn the static scene representation. This filtering module learns the transient phenomena guided by pixel-wise semantic features obtained by a trainable image encoder that can be trained across multiple scenes to learn the prior of transient objects. Furthermore, we present two techniques to prevent ambiguous decomposition and noisy results of the filtering module. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods on Phototourism dataset in a few-shot setting. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPT achieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automatic evaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluation metric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of NLG models is an arduous task and previous statistical metrics notoriously show their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is a good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary meta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail, we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g., summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt ChatGPT to score the generation of NLG models. We conduct experiments on three widely-used NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation and data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation with golden human judgments. We hope our preliminary study could prompt the emergence of a general-purposed reliable NLG metric. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We have recently seen tremendous progress in neural rendering (NR) advances, i.e., NeRF, for photo-real free-view synthesis. Yet, as a local technique based on a single computer/GPU, even the best-engineered Instant-NGP or i-NGP cannot reach real-time performance when rendering at a high resolution, and often requires huge local computing resources. In this paper, we resort to cloud rendering and present NEPHELE, a neural platform for highly realistic cloud radiance rendering. In stark contrast with existing NR approaches, our NEPHELE allows for more powerful rendering capabilities by combining multiple remote GPUs and facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple people to view the same NeRF scene simultaneously. We introduce i-NOLF to employ opacity light fields for ultra-fast neural radiance rendering in a one-query-per-ray manner. We further resemble the Lumigraph with geometry proxies for fast ray querying and subsequently employ a small MLP to model the local opacity lumishperes for high-quality rendering. We also adopt Perfect Spatial Hashing in i-NOLF to enhance cache coherence. As a result, our i-NOLF achieves an order of magnitude performance gain in terms of efficiency than i-NGP, especially for the multi-user multi-viewpoint setting under cloud rendering scenarios. We further tailor a task scheduler accompanied by our i-NOLF representation and demonstrate the advance of our methodological design through a comprehensive cloud platform, consisting of a series of cooperated modules, i.e., render farms, task assigner, frame composer, and detailed streaming strategies. Using such a cloud platform compatible with neural rendering, we further showcase the capabilities of our cloud radiance rendering through a series of applications, ranging from cloud VR/AR rendering. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot's visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 11 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models. Code, data, and training details will be publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Rich data and powerful machine learning models allow us to design drugs for a specific protein target \textit{in silico}. Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fall accidents are critical issues in an aging and aged society. Recently, many researchers developed pre-impact fall detection systems using deep learning to support wearable-based fall protection systems for preventing severe injuries. However, most works only employed simple neural network models instead of complex models considering the usability in resource-constrained mobile devices and strict latency requirements. In this work, we propose a novel pre-impact fall detection via CNN-ViT knowledge distillation, namely PreFallKD, to strike a balance between detection performance and computational complexity. The proposed PreFallKD transfers the detection knowledge from the pre-trained teacher model (vision transformer) to the student model (lightweight convolutional neural networks). Additionally, we apply data augmentation techniques to tackle issues of data imbalance. We conduct the experiment on the KFall public dataset and compare PreFallKD with other state-of-the-art models. The experiment results show that PreFallKD could boost the student model during the testing phase and achieves reliable F1-score (92.66%) and lead time (551.3 ms). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Underwater caves are challenging environments that are crucial for water resource management, and for our understanding of hydro-geology and history. Mapping underwater caves is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and hazardous operation. For autonomous cave mapping by underwater robots, the major challenge lies in vision-based estimation in the complete absence of ambient light, which results in constantly moving shadows due to the motion of the camera-light setup. Thus, detecting and following the caveline as navigation guidance is paramount for robots in autonomous cave mapping missions. In this paper, we present a computationally light caveline detection model based on a novel Vision Transformer (ViT)-based learning pipeline. We address the problem of scarce annotated training data by a weakly supervised formulation where the learning is reinforced through a series of noisy predictions from intermediate sub-optimal models. We validate the utility and effectiveness of such weak supervision for caveline detection and tracking in three different cave locations: USA, Mexico, and Spain. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model, CL-ViT, balances the robustness-efficiency trade-off, ensuring good generalization performance while offering 10+ FPS on single-board (Jetson TX2) devices. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose an effective sound event detection (SED) method based on the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model, pretrained on the large-scale AudioSet for audio tagging (AT) task, termed AST-SED. Pretrained AST models have recently shown promise on DCASE2022 challenge task4 where they help mitigate a lack of sufficient real annotated data. However, mainly due to differences between the AT and SED tasks, it is suboptimal to directly utilize outputs from a pretrained AST model. Hence the proposed AST-SED adopts an encoder-decoder architecture to enable effective and efficient fine-tuning without needing to redesign or retrain the AST model. Specifically, the Frequency-wise Transformer Encoder (FTE) consists of transformers with self attention along the frequency axis to address multiple overlapped audio events issue in a single clip. The Local Gated Recurrent Units Decoder (LGD) consists of nearest-neighbor interpolation (NNI) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRU) to compensate for temporal resolution loss in the pretrained AST model output. Experimental results on DCASE2022 task4 development set have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed AST-SED with FTE-LGD architecture. Specifically, the Event-Based F1-score (EB-F1) of 59.60% and Polyphonic Sound detection Score scenario1 (PSDS1) score of 0.5140 significantly outperform CRNN and other pretrained AST-based systems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The use of supervised deep learning techniques to detect pathologies in brain MRI scans can be challenging due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the need for annotated data sets. An alternative approach is to use unsupervised anomaly detection, which only requires sample-level labels of healthy brains to create a reference representation. This reference representation can then be compared to unhealthy brain anatomy in a pixel-wise manner to identify abnormalities. To accomplish this, generative models are needed to create anatomically consistent MRI scans of healthy brains. While recent diffusion models have shown promise in this task, accurately generating the complex structure of the human brain remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method that reformulates the generation task of diffusion models as a patch-based estimation of healthy brain anatomy, using spatial context to guide and improve reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on data of tumors and multiple sclerosis lesions and demonstrate a relative improvement of 25.1% compared to existing baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
