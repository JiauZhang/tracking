### SinDDM: A Single Image Denoising Diffusion Model
Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have led to staggering performance leaps in image generation, editing and restoration. However, existing DDMs use very large datasets for training. Here, we introduce a framework for training a DDM on a single image. Our method, which we coin SinDDM, learns the internal statistics of the training image by using a multi-scale diffusion process. To drive the reverse diffusion process, we use a fully-convolutional light-weight denoiser, which is conditioned on both the noise level and the scale. This architecture allows generating samples of arbitrary dimensions, in a coarse-to-fine manner. As we illustrate, SinDDM generates diverse high-quality samples, and is applicable in a wide array of tasks, including style transfer and harmonization. Furthermore, it can be easily guided by external supervision. Particularly, we demonstrate text-guided generation from a single image using a pre-trained CLIP model. 

### Hierarchical Transformer for Survival Prediction Using Multimodality  Whole Slide Images and Genomics
Learning good representation of giga-pixel level whole slide pathology images (WSI) for downstream tasks is critical. Previous studies employ multiple instance learning (MIL) to represent WSIs as bags of sampled patches because, for most occasions, only slide-level labels are available, and only a tiny region of the WSI is disease-positive area. However, WSI representation learning still remains an open problem due to: (1) patch sampling on a higher resolution may be incapable of depicting microenvironment information such as the relative position between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues, while patches at lower resolution lose the fine-grained detail; (2) extracting patches from giant WSI results in large bag size, which tremendously increases the computational cost. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical-based multimodal transformer framework that learns a hierarchical mapping between pathology images and corresponding genes. Precisely, we randomly extract instant-level patch features from WSIs with different magnification. Then a co-attention mapping between imaging and genomics is learned to uncover the pairwise interaction and reduce the space complexity of imaging features. Such early fusion makes it computationally feasible to use MIL Transformer for the survival prediction task. Our architecture requires fewer GPU resources compared with benchmark methods while maintaining better WSI representation ability. We evaluate our approach on five cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and achieved an average c-index of $0.673$, outperforming the state-of-the-art multimodality methods. 

### SPARTAN: Sparse Hierarchical Memory for Parameter-Efficient Transformers
Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieves impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks, and their sizes have consequently been getting bigger. Since a different copy of the model is required for each task, this paradigm is infeasible for storage-constrained edge devices like mobile phones. In this paper, we propose SPARTAN, a parameter efficient (PE) and computationally fast architecture for edge devices that adds hierarchically organized sparse memory after each Transformer layer. SPARTAN freezes the PLM parameters and fine-tunes only its memory, thus significantly reducing storage costs by re-using the PLM backbone for different tasks. SPARTAN contains two levels of memory, with only a sparse subset of parents being chosen in the first level for each input, and children cells corresponding to those parents being used to compute an output representation. This sparsity combined with other architecture optimizations improves SPARTAN's throughput by over 90% during inference on a Raspberry Pi 4 when compared to PE baselines (adapters) while also outperforming the latter by 0.1 points on the GLUE benchmark. Further, it can be trained 34% faster in a few-shot setting, while performing within 0.9 points of adapters. Qualitative analysis shows that different parent cells in SPARTAN specialize in different topics, thus dividing responsibility efficiently. 

### CLIP-Nav: Using CLIP for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation
Household environments are visually diverse. Embodied agents performing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in the wild must be able to handle this diversity, while also following arbitrary language instructions. Recently, Vision-Language models like CLIP have shown great performance on the task of zero-shot object recognition. In this work, we ask if these models are also capable of zero-shot language grounding. In particular, we utilize CLIP to tackle the novel problem of zero-shot VLN using natural language referring expressions that describe target objects, in contrast to past work that used simple language templates describing object classes. We examine CLIP's capability in making sequential navigational decisions without any dataset-specific finetuning, and study how it influences the path that an agent takes. Our results on the coarse-grained instruction following task of REVERIE demonstrate the navigational capability of CLIP, surpassing the supervised baseline in terms of both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL). More importantly, we quantitatively show that our CLIP-based zero-shot approach generalizes better to show consistent performance across environments when compared to SOTA, fully supervised learning approaches when evaluated via Relative Change in Success (RCS). 

### ShaDocNet: Learning Spatial-Aware Tokens in Transformer for Document  Shadow Removal
Shadow removal improves the visual quality and legibility of digital copies of documents. However, document shadow removal remains an unresolved subject. Traditional techniques rely on heuristics that vary from situation to situation. Given the quality and quantity of current public datasets, the majority of neural network models are ill-equipped for this task. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based model for document shadow removal that utilizes shadow context encoding and decoding in both shadow and shadow-free regions. Additionally, shadow detection and pixel-level enhancement are included in the whole coarse-to-fine process. On the basis of comprehensive benchmark evaluations, it is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. 

### 3D Neural Field Generation using Triplane Diffusion
Diffusion models have emerged as the state-of-the-art for image generation, among other tasks. Here, we present an efficient diffusion-based model for 3D-aware generation of neural fields. Our approach pre-processes training data, such as ShapeNet meshes, by converting them to continuous occupancy fields and factoring them into a set of axis-aligned triplane feature representations. Thus, our 3D training scenes are all represented by 2D feature planes, and we can directly train existing 2D diffusion models on these representations to generate 3D neural fields with high quality and diversity, outperforming alternative approaches to 3D-aware generation. Our approach requires essential modifications to existing triplane factorization pipelines to make the resulting features easy to learn for the diffusion model. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on 3D generation on several object classes from ShapeNet. 

### FREDSR: Fourier Residual Efficient Diffusive GAN for Single Image Super  Resolution
FREDSR is a GAN variant that aims to outperform traditional GAN models in specific tasks such as Single Image Super Resolution with extreme parameter efficiency at the cost of per-dataset generalizeability. FREDSR integrates fast Fourier transformation, residual prediction, diffusive discriminators, etc to achieve strong performance in comparisons to other models on the UHDSR4K dataset for Single Image 3x Super Resolution from 360p and 720p with only 37000 parameters. The model follows the characteristics of the given dataset, resulting in lower generalizeability but higher performance on tasks such as real time up-scaling. 

### A fully asymptotic preserving decomposed multi-group method for the  frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations
The opacity of FRTE depends on not only the material temperature but also the frequency, whose values may vary several orders of magnitude for different frequencies. The gray radiation diffusion and frequency-dependent diffusion equations are two simplified models that can approximate the solution to FRTE in the thick opacity regime. The frequency discretization for the two limit models highly affects the numerical accuracy. However, classical frequency discretization for FRTE considers only the absorbing coefficient. In this paper, we propose a new decomposed multi-group method for frequency discretization that is not only AP in both gray radiation diffusion and frequency-dependent diffusion limits, but also the frequency discretization of the limiting models can be tuned. Based on the decomposed multi-group method, a full AP scheme in frequency, time, and space is proposed. Several numerical examples are used to verify the performance of the proposed scheme. 

### Coordinating Cross-modal Distillation for Molecular Property Prediction
In recent years, molecular graph representation learning (GRL) has drawn much more attention in molecular property prediction (MPP) problems. The existing graph methods have demonstrated that 3D geometric information is significant for better performance in MPP. However, accurate 3D structures are often costly and time-consuming to obtain, limiting the large-scale application of GRL. It is an intuitive solution to train with 3D to 2D knowledge distillation and predict with only 2D inputs. But some challenging problems remain open for 3D to 2D distillation. One is that the 3D view is quite distinct from the 2D view, and the other is that the gradient magnitudes of atoms in distillation are discrepant and unstable due to the variable molecular size. To address these challenging problems, we exclusively propose a distillation framework that contains global molecular distillation and local atom distillation. We also provide a theoretical insight to justify how to coordinate atom and molecular information, which tackles the drawback of variable molecular size for atom information distillation. Experimental results on two popular molecular datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves superior performance over other methods. Specifically, on the largest MPP dataset PCQM4Mv2 served as an "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge" in the field of graph ML, the proposed method achieved a 6.9% improvement compared with the best works. And we obtained fourth place with the MAE of 0.0734 on the test-challenge set for OGB-LSC 2022 Graph Regression Task. We will release the code soon. 

### HEAT: Hardware-Efficient Automatic Tensor Decomposition for Transformer  Compression
Transformers have attained superior performance in natural language processing and computer vision. Their self-attention and feedforward layers are overparameterized, limiting inference speed and energy efficiency. Tensor decomposition is a promising technique to reduce parameter redundancy by leveraging tensor algebraic properties to express the parameters in a factorized form. Prior efforts used manual or heuristic factorization settings without hardware-aware customization, resulting in poor hardware efficiencies and large performance degradation. 

### Score-based Continuous-time Discrete Diffusion Models
Score-based modeling through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) has provided a new perspective on diffusion models, and demonstrated superior performance on continuous data. However, the gradient of the log-likelihood function, i.e., the score function, is not properly defined for discrete spaces. This makes it non-trivial to adapt \textcolor{\cdiff}{the score-based modeling} to categorical data. In this paper, we extend diffusion models to discrete variables by introducing a stochastic jump process where the reverse process denoises via a continuous-time Markov chain. This formulation admits an analytical simulation during backward sampling. To learn the reverse process, we extend score matching to general categorical data and show that an unbiased estimator can be obtained via simple matching of the conditional marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a set of synthetic and real-world music and image benchmarks. 

### Adaptive adversarial training method for improving multi-scale GAN based  on generalization bound theory
In recent years, multi-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proposed to build generalized image processing models based on single sample. Constraining on the sample size, multi-scale GANs have much difficulty converging to the global optimum, which ultimately leads to limitations in their capabilities. In this paper, we pioneered the introduction of PAC-Bayes generalized bound theory into the training analysis of specific models under different adversarial training methods, which can obtain a non-vacuous upper bound on the generalization error for the specified multi-scale GAN structure. Based on the drastic changes we found of the generalization error bound under different adversarial attacks and different training states, we proposed an adaptive training method which can greatly improve the image manipulation ability of multi-scale GANs. The final experimental results show that our adaptive training method in this paper has greatly contributed to the improvement of the quality of the images generated by multi-scale GANs on several image manipulation tasks. In particular, for the image super-resolution restoration task, the multi-scale GAN model trained by the proposed method achieves a 100% reduction in natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) and a 60% reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE), which is better than many models trained on large-scale datasets. 

### Dr.3D: Adapting 3D GANs to Artistic Drawings
While 3D GANs have recently demonstrated the high-quality synthesis of multi-view consistent images and 3D shapes, they are mainly restricted to photo-realistic human portraits. This paper aims to extend 3D GANs to a different, but meaningful visual form: artistic portrait drawings. However, extending existing 3D GANs to drawings is challenging due to the inevitable geometric ambiguity present in drawings. To tackle this, we present Dr.3D, a novel adaptation approach that adapts an existing 3D GAN to artistic drawings. Dr.3D is equipped with three novel components to handle the geometric ambiguity: a deformation-aware 3D synthesis network, an alternating adaptation of pose estimation and image synthesis, and geometric priors. Experiments show that our approach can successfully adapt 3D GANs to drawings and enable multi-view consistent semantic editing of drawings. 

### MVRackLay: Monocular Multi-View Layout Estimation for Warehouse Racks  and Shelves
In this paper, we propose and showcase, for the first time, monocular multi-view layout estimation for warehouse racks and shelves. Unlike typical layout estimation methods, MVRackLay estimates multi-layered layouts, wherein each layer corresponds to the layout of a shelf within a rack. Given a sequence of images of a warehouse scene, a dual-headed Convolutional-LSTM architecture outputs segmented racks, the front and the top view layout of each shelf within a rack. With minimal effort, such an output is transformed into a 3D rendering of all racks, shelves and objects on the shelves, giving an accurate 3D depiction of the entire warehouse scene in terms of racks, shelves and the number of objects on each shelf. MVRackLay generalizes to a diverse set of warehouse scenes with varying number of objects on each shelf, number of shelves and in the presence of other such racks in the background. Further, MVRackLay shows superior performance vis-a-vis its single view counterpart, RackLay, in layout accuracy, quantized in terms of the mean IoU and mAP metrics. We also showcase a multi-view stitching of the 3D layouts resulting in a representation of the warehouse scene with respect to a global reference frame akin to a rendering of the scene from a SLAM pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work to portray a 3D rendering of a warehouse scene in terms of its semantic components - Racks, Shelves and Objects - all from a single monocular camera. 

### T2G-Former: Organizing Tabular Features into Relation Graphs Promotes  Heterogeneous Feature Interaction
Recent development of deep neural networks (DNNs) for tabular learning has largely benefited from the capability of DNNs for automatic feature interaction. However, the heterogeneity nature of tabular features makes such features relatively independent, and developing effective methods to promote tabular feature interaction still remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Estimator, which automatically estimates the relations among tabular features and builds graphs by assigning edges between related features. Such relation graphs organize independent tabular features into a kind of graph data such that interaction of nodes (tabular features) can be conducted in an orderly fashion. Based on our proposed Graph Estimator, we present a bespoke Transformer network tailored for tabular learning, called T2G-Former, which processes tabular data by performing tabular feature interaction guided by the relation graphs. A specific Cross-level Readout collects salient features predicted by the layers in T2G-Former across different levels, and attains global semantics for final prediction. Comprehensive experiments show that our T2G-Former achieves superior performance among DNNs and is competitive with non-deep Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models. 

### Quadapter: Adapter for GPT-2 Quantization
Transformer language models such as GPT-2 are difficult to quantize because of outliers in activations leading to a large quantization error. To adapt to the error, one must use quantization-aware training, which entails a fine-tuning process based on the dataset and the training pipeline identical to those for the original model. Pretrained language models, however, often do not grant access to their datasets and training pipelines, forcing us to rely on arbitrary ones for fine-tuning. In that case, it is observed that quantization-aware training overfits the model to the fine-tuning data. For quantization without overfitting, we introduce a quantization adapter (Quadapter), a small set of parameters that are learned to make activations quantization-friendly by scaling them channel-wise. It keeps the model parameters unchanged. By applying our method to the challenging task of quantizing GPT-2, we demonstrate that it effectively prevents the overfitting and improves the quantization performance. 

### 3D GAN Inversion with Facial Symmetry Prior
Recently, a surge of high-quality 3D-aware GANs have been proposed, which leverage the generative power of neural rendering. It is natural to associate 3D GANs with GAN inversion methods to project a real image into the generator's latent space, allowing free-view consistent synthesis and editing, referred as 3D GAN inversion. Although with the facial prior preserved in pre-trained 3D GANs, reconstructing a 3D portrait with only one monocular image is still an ill-pose problem. The straightforward application of 2D GAN inversion methods focuses on texture similarity only while ignoring the correctness of 3D geometry shapes. It may raise geometry collapse effects, especially when reconstructing a side face under an extreme pose. Besides, the synthetic results in novel views are prone to be blurry. In this work, we propose a novel method to promote 3D GAN inversion by introducing facial symmetry prior. We design a pipeline and constraints to make full use of the pseudo auxiliary view obtained via image flipping, which helps obtain a robust and reasonable geometry shape during the inversion process. To enhance texture fidelity in unobserved viewpoints, pseudo labels from depth-guided 3D warping can provide extra supervision. We design constraints aimed at filtering out conflict areas for optimization in asymmetric situations. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on image reconstruction and editing demonstrate the superiority of our method. 

### DiffPose: Toward More Reliable 3D Pose Estimation
Monocular 3D human pose estimation is quite challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and occlusion, which often lead to high uncertainty and indeterminacy. On the other hand, diffusion models have recently emerged as an effective tool for generating high-quality images from noise. Inspired by their capability, we explore a novel pose estimation framework (DiffPose) that formulates 3D pose estimation as a reverse diffusion process. We incorporate novel designs into our DiffPose that facilitate the diffusion process for 3D pose estimation: a pose-specific initialization of pose uncertainty distributions, a Gaussian Mixture Model-based forward diffusion process, and a context-conditioned reverse diffusion process. Our proposed DiffPose significantly outperforms existing methods on the widely used pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. 

### Pattern Attention Transformer with Doughnut Kernel
We present in this paper a new architecture, the Pattern Attention Transformer (PAT), that is composed of the new doughnut kernel. Compared with tokens in the NLP field, Transformer in computer vision has the problem of handling the high resolution of pixels in images. Inheriting the patch/window idea from ViT and its follow-ups, the doughnut kernel enhances the design of patches. It replaces the line-cut boundaries with two types of areas: sensor and updating, which is based on the comprehension of self-attention (named QKVA grid). The doughnut kernel also brings a new topic about the shape of kernels. To verify its performance on image classification, PAT is designed with Transformer blocks of regular octagon shape doughnut kernels. Its performance on ImageNet 1K surpasses the Swin Transformer (+0.7 acc1). 

### QuadFormer: Quadruple Transformer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in  Power Line Segmentation of Aerial Images
Accurate segmentation of power lines in aerial images is essential to ensure the flight safety of aerial vehicles. Acquiring high-quality ground truth annotations for training a deep learning model is a laborious process. Therefore, developing algorithms that can leverage knowledge from labelled synthetic data to unlabelled real images is highly demanded. This process is studied in Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Recent approaches to self-training have achieved remarkable performance in UDA for semantic segmentation, which trains a model with pseudo labels on the target domain. However, the pseudo labels are noisy due to a discrepancy in the two data distributions. We identify that context dependency is important for bridging this domain gap. Motivated by this, we propose QuadFormer, a novel framework designed for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. The hierarchical quadruple transformer combines cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms to adapt transferable context. Based on cross-attentive and self-attentive feature representations, we introduce a pseudo label correction scheme to online denoise the pseudo labels and reduce the domain gap. Additionally, we present two datasets - ARPLSyn and ARPLReal to further advance research in unsupervised domain adaptive powerline segmentation. Finally, experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for the domain adaptive power line segmentation on ARPLSyn$\rightarrow$TTTPLA and ARPLSyn$\rightarrow$ARPLReal. 

### Spatio-Temporal Crop Aggregation for Video Representation Learning
We propose Spatio-temporal Crop Aggregation for video representation LEarning (SCALE), a novel method that enjoys high scalability at both training and inference time. Our model builds long-range video features by learning from sets of video clip-level features extracted with a pre-trained backbone. To train the model, we propose a self-supervised objective consisting of masked clip feature prediction. We apply sparsity to both the input, by extracting a random set of video clips, and to the loss function, by only reconstructing the sparse inputs. Moreover, we use dimensionality reduction by working in the latent space of a pre-trained backbone applied to single video clips. The video representation is then obtained by taking the ensemble of the concatenation of embeddings of separate video clips with a video clip set summarization token. These techniques make our method not only extremely efficient to train, but also highly effective in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our video representation yields state-of-the-art performance with linear, non-linear, and $k$-NN probing on common action classification datasets. 

### High-Fidelity Guided Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models
Controllable image synthesis with user scribbles has gained huge public interest with the recent advent of text-conditioned latent diffusion models. The user scribbles control the color composition while the text prompt provides control over the overall image semantics. However, we note that prior works in this direction suffer from an intrinsic domain shift problem, wherein the generated outputs often lack details and resemble simplistic representations of the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel guided image synthesis framework, which addresses this problem by modeling the output image as the solution of a constrained optimization problem. We show that while computing an exact solution to the optimization is infeasible, an approximation of the same can be achieved while just requiring a single pass of the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we show that by simply defining a cross-attention based correspondence between the input text tokens and the user stroke-painting, the user is also able to control the semantics of different painted regions without requiring any conditional training or finetuning. Human user study results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by over 85.32% on the overall user satisfaction scores. Project page for our paper is available at https://1jsingh.github.io/gradop. 

### Refining Generative Process with Discriminator Guidance in Score-based  Diffusion Models
While the success of diffusion models has been witnessed in various domains, only a few works have investigated the variation of the generative process. In this paper, we introduce a new generative process that is closer to the reverse process than the original generative process, given the identical score checkpoint. Specifically, we adjust the generative process with the auxiliary discriminator between the real data and the generated data. Consequently, the adjusted generative process with the discriminator generates more realistic samples than the original process. In experiments, we achieve new SOTA FIDs of 1.74 on CIFAR-10, 1.33 on CelebA, and 1.88 on FFHQ in the unconditional generation. 

### Diffusion Probabilistic Model Made Slim
Despite the recent visually-pleasing results achieved, the massive computational cost has been a long-standing flaw for diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), which, in turn, greatly limits their applications on resource-limited platforms. Prior methods towards efficient DPM, however, have largely focused on accelerating the testing yet overlooked their huge complexity and sizes. In this paper, we make a dedicated attempt to lighten DPM while striving to preserve its favourable performance. We start by training a small-sized latent diffusion model (LDM) from scratch, but observe a significant fidelity drop in the synthetic images. Through a thorough assessment, we find that DPM is intrinsically biased against high-frequency generation, and learns to recover different frequency components at different time-steps. These properties make compact networks unable to represent frequency dynamics with accurate high-frequency estimation. Towards this end, we introduce a customized design for slim DPM, which we term as Spectral Diffusion (SD), for light-weight image synthesis. SD incorporates wavelet gating in its architecture to enable frequency dynamic feature extraction at every reverse steps, and conducts spectrum-aware distillation to promote high-frequency recovery by inverse weighting the objective based on spectrum magni tudes. Experimental results demonstrate that, SD achieves 8-18x computational complexity reduction as compared to the latent diffusion models on a series of conditional and unconditional image generation tasks while retaining competitive image fidelity. 

### Handling and extracting key entities from customer conversations using  Speech recognition and Named Entity recognition
In this modern era of technology with e-commerce developing at a rapid pace, it is very important to understand customer requirements and details from a business conversation. It is very crucial for customer retention and satisfaction. Extracting key insights from these conversations is very important when it comes to developing their product or solving their issue. Understanding customer feedback, responses, and important details of the product are essential and it would be done using Named entity recognition (NER). For extracting the entities we would be converting the conversations to text using the optimal speech-to-text model. The model would be a two-stage network in which the conversation is converted to text. Then, suitable entities are extracted using robust techniques using a NER BERT transformer model. This will aid in the enrichment of customer experience when there is an issue which is faced by them. If a customer faces a problem he will call and register his complaint. The model will then extract the key features from this conversation which will be necessary to look into the problem. These features would include details like the order number, and the exact problem. All these would be extracted directly from the conversation and this would reduce the effort of going through the conversation again. 

### BudgetLongformer: Can we Cheaply Pretrain a SotA Legal Language Model  From Scratch?
Pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many tasks and benchmarks recently. Many state-of-the-art Language Models (LMs), however, do not scale well above the threshold of 512 input tokens. In specialized domains though (such as legal, scientific or biomedical), models often need to process very long text (sometimes well above 10000 tokens). Even though many efficient transformers have been proposed (such as Longformer, BigBird or FNet), so far, only very few such efficient models are available for specialized domains. Additionally, since the pretraining process is extremely costly in general - but even more so as the sequence length increases - it is often only in reach of large research labs. One way of making pretraining cheaper is the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) task, by providing more signal during training, since the loss can be computed over all tokens. In this work, we train Longformer models with the efficient RTD task on legal data to showcase that pretraining efficient LMs is possible using much less compute. We evaluate the trained models on challenging summarization tasks requiring the model to summarize long texts to show to what extent the models can achieve good performance on downstream tasks. We find that both the small and base models outperform their baselines on the in-domain BillSum and out-of-domain PubMed tasks in their respective parameter range. We publish our code and models for research purposes. 

### CKS: A Community-based K-shell Decomposition Approach using Community  Bridge Nodes for Influence Maximization
Social networks have enabled user-specific advertisements and recommendations on their platforms, which puts a significant focus on Influence Maximisation (IM) for target advertising and related tasks. The aim is to identify nodes in the network which can maximize the spread of information through a diffusion cascade. We propose a community structures-based approach that employs K-Shell algorithm with community structures to generate a score for the connections between seed nodes and communities. Further, our approach employs entropy within communities to ensure the proper spread of information within the communities. We validate our approach on four publicly available networks and show its superiority to four state-of-the-art approaches while still being relatively efficient. 

### Topological Data Analysis for Speech Processing
We apply topological data analysis (TDA) to speech classification problems and to the introspection of a pretrained speech model, HuBERT. To this end, we introduce a number of topological and algebraic features derived from Transformer attention maps and embeddings. We show that a simple linear classifier built on top of such features outperforms a fine-tuned classification head. In particular, we achieve an improvement of about $9\%$ accuracy and $5\%$ ERR on four common datasets; on CREMA-D, the proposed feature set reaches a new state of the art performance with accuracy $80.155$. We also show that topological features are able to reveal functional roles of speech Transformer heads; e.g., we find the heads capable to distinguish between pairs of sample sources (natural/synthetic) or voices without any downstream fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that TDA is a promising new approach for speech analysis, especially for tasks that require structural prediction. 

### SinGRAF: Learning a 3D Generative Radiance Field for a Single Scene
Generative models have shown great promise in synthesizing photorealistic 3D objects, but they require large amounts of training data. We introduce SinGRAF, a 3D-aware generative model that is trained with a few input images of a single scene. Once trained, SinGRAF generates different realizations of this 3D scene that preserve the appearance of the input while varying scene layout. For this purpose, we build on recent progress in 3D GAN architectures and introduce a novel progressive-scale patch discrimination approach during training. With several experiments, we demonstrate that the results produced by SinGRAF outperform the closest related works in both quality and diversity by a large margin.
