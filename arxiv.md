        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: During the last two years there has been a plethora of large generative models such as ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion that have been published. Concretely, these models are able to perform tasks such as being a general question and answering system or automatically creating artistic images that are revolutionizing several sectors. Consequently, the implications that these generative models have in the industry and society are enormous, as several job positions may be transformed. For example, Generative AI is capable of transforming effectively and creatively texts to images, like the DALLE-2 model; text to 3D images, like the Dreamfusion model; images to text, like the Flamingo model; texts to video, like the Phenaki model; texts to audio, like the AudioLM model; texts to other texts, like ChatGPT; texts to code, like the Codex model; texts to scientific texts, like the Galactica model or even create algorithms like AlphaTensor. This work consists on an attempt to describe in a concise way the main models are sectors that are affected by generative AI and to provide a taxonomy of the main generative models published recently. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale language model pretraining is a very successful form of self-supervised learning in natural language processing, but it is increasingly expensive to perform as the models and pretraining corpora have become larger over time. We propose NarrowBERT, a modified transformer encoder that increases the throughput for masked language model pretraining by more than $2\times$. NarrowBERT sparsifies the transformer model such that the self-attention queries and feedforward layers only operate on the masked tokens of each sentence during pretraining, rather than all of the tokens as with the usual transformer encoder. We also show that NarrowBERT increases the throughput at inference time by as much as $3.5\times$ with minimal (or no) performance degradation on sentence encoding tasks like MNLI. Finally, we examine the performance of NarrowBERT on the IMDB and Amazon reviews classification and CoNLL NER tasks and show that it is also comparable to standard BERT performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Cognitive scientists believe adaptable intelligent agents like humans perform reasoning through learned causal mental simulations of agents and environments. The problem of learning such simulations is called predictive world modeling. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) agents leveraging world models have achieved SOTA performance in game environments. However, understanding how to apply the world modeling approach in complex real-world environments relevant to mobile robots remains an open question. In this paper, we present a framework for learning a probabilistic predictive world model for real-world road environments. We implement the model using a hierarchical VAE (HVAE) capable of predicting a diverse set of fully observed plausible worlds from accumulated sensor observations. While prior HVAE methods require complete states as ground truth for learning, we present a novel sequential training method to allow HVAEs to learn to predict complete states from partially observed states only. We experimentally demonstrate accurate spatial structure prediction of deterministic regions achieving 96.21 IoU, and close the gap to perfect prediction by 62 % for stochastic regions using the best prediction. By extending HVAEs to cases where complete ground truth states do not exist, we facilitate continual learning of spatial prediction as a step towards realizing explainable and comprehensive predictive world models for real-world mobile robotics applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite continued advancement in recent years, deep neural networks still rely on large amounts of training data to avoid overfitting. However, labeled training data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and difficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing policies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space, existing data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance augmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our macroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this generative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar classification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully synthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative models, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in generating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier performance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after curation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) achieves promising results in 2D zero-shot and few-shot learning. Despite the impressive performance in 2D tasks, applying CLIP to help the learning in 3D scene understanding has yet to be explored. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate how CLIP knowledge benefits 3D scene understanding. To this end, we propose CLIP2Scene, a simple yet effective framework that transfers CLIP knowledge from 2D image-text pre-trained models to a 3D point cloud network. We show that the pre-trained 3D network yields impressive performance on various downstream tasks, i.e., annotation-free and fine-tuning with labelled data for semantic segmentation. Specifically, built upon CLIP, we design a Semantic-driven Cross-modal Contrastive Learning framework that pre-trains a 3D network via semantic and spatial-temporal consistency regularization. For semantic consistency regularization, we first leverage CLIP's text semantics to select the positive and negative point samples and then employ the contrastive loss to train the 3D network. In terms of spatial-temporal consistency regularization, we force the consistency between the temporally coherent point cloud features and their corresponding image features. We conduct experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets. For the first time, our pre-trained network achieves annotation-free 3D semantic segmentation with 20.8\% mIoU. When fine-tuned with 1\% or 100\% labelled data, our method significantly outperforms other self-supervised methods, with improvements of 8\% and 1\% mIoU, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability for handling cross-domain datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper we introduce the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT), a fully-attentional model for general Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) processing based on the Vision Transformer (ViT). TSViT splits a SITS record into non-overlapping patches in space and time which are tokenized and subsequently processed by a factorized temporo-spatial encoder. We argue, that in contrast to natural images, a temporal-then-spatial factorization is more intuitive for SITS processing and present experimental evidence for this claim. Additionally, we enhance the model's discriminative power by introducing two novel mechanisms for acquisition-time-specific temporal positional encodings and multiple learnable class tokens. The effect of all novel design choices is evaluated through an extensive ablation study. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous approaches by a significant margin in three publicly available SITS semantic segmentation and classification datasets. All model, training and evaluation codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Interpretability research aims to build tools for understanding machine learning (ML) models. However, such tools are inherently hard to evaluate because we do not have ground truth information about how ML models actually work. In this work, we propose to build transformer models manually as a testbed for interpretability research. We introduce Tracr, a "compiler" for translating human-readable programs into weights of a transformer model. Tracr takes code written in RASP, a domain-specific language (Weiss et al. 2021), and translates it into weights for a standard, decoder-only, GPT-like transformer architecture. We use Tracr to create a range of ground truth transformers that implement programs including computing token frequencies, sorting, and Dyck-n parenthesis checking, among others. To enable the broader research community to explore and use compiled models, we provide an open-source implementation of Tracr at https://github.com/deepmind/tracr. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many popular machine learning models scale poorly when deployed on CPUs. In this paper we explore the reasons why and propose a simple, yet effective approach based on the well-known Divide-and-Conquer Principle to tackle this problem of great practical importance. Given an inference job, instead of using all available computing resources (i.e., CPU cores) for running it, the idea is to break the job into independent parts that can be executed in parallel, each with the number of cores according to its expected computational cost. We implement this idea in the popular OnnxRuntime framework and evaluate its effectiveness with several use cases, including the well-known models for optical character recognition (PaddleOCR) and natural language processing (BERT). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most approaches to cross-modal retrieval (CMR) focus either on object-centric datasets, meaning that each document depicts or describes a single object, or on scene-centric datasets, meaning that each image depicts or describes a complex scene that involves multiple objects and relations between them. We posit that a robust CMR model should generalize well across both dataset types. Despite recent advances in CMR, the reproducibility of the results and their generalizability across different dataset types has not been studied before. We address this gap and focus on the reproducibility of the state-of-the-art CMR results when evaluated on object-centric and scene-centric datasets. We select two state-of-the-art CMR models with different architectures: (i) CLIP; and (ii) X-VLM. Additionally, we select two scene-centric datasets, and three object-centric datasets, and determine the relative performance of the selected models on these datasets. We focus on reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of the outcomes of previously published CMR experiments. We discover that the experiments are not fully reproducible and replicable. Besides, the relative performance results partially generalize across object-centric and scene-centric datasets. On top of that, the scores obtained on object-centric datasets are much lower than the scores obtained on scene-centric datasets. For reproducibility and transparency we make our source code and the trained models publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we initiate the idea of using denoising diffusion models to learn priors for online decision making problems. Our special focus is on the meta-learning for bandit framework, with the goal of learning a strategy that performs well across bandit tasks of a same class. To this end, we train a diffusion model that learns the underlying task distribution and combine Thompson sampling with the learned prior to deal with new tasks at test time. Our posterior sampling algorithm is designed to carefully balance between the learned prior and the noisy observations that come from the learner's interaction with the environment. To capture realistic bandit scenarios, we also propose a novel diffusion model training procedure that trains even from incomplete and/or noisy data, which could be of independent interest. Finally, our extensive experimental evaluations clearly demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in large-scale texts into predefined classes. NER in French and other relatively limited-resource languages cannot always benefit from approaches proposed for languages like English due to a dearth of large, robust datasets. In this paper, we present our work that aims to mitigate the effects of this dearth of large, labeled datasets. We propose a Transformer-based NER approach for French, using adversarial adaptation to similar domain or general corpora to improve feature extraction and enable better generalization. Our approach allows learning better features using large-scale unlabeled corpora from the same domain or mixed domains to introduce more variations during training and reduce overfitting. Experimental results on three labeled datasets show that our adaptation framework outperforms the corresponding non-adaptive models for various combinations of Transformer models, source datasets, and target corpora. We also show that adversarial adaptation to large-scale unlabeled corpora can help mitigate the performance dip incurred on using Transformer models pre-trained on smaller corpora. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We develop a self-supervised method for density-based anomaly detection using contrastive learning, and test it using event-level anomaly data from CMS ADC2021. The AnomalyCLR technique is data-driven and uses augmentations of the background data to mimic non-Standard-Model events in a model-agnostic way. It uses a permutation-invariant Transformer Encoder architecture to map the objects measured in a collider event to the representation space, where the data augmentations define a representation space which is sensitive to potential anomalous features. An AutoEncoder trained on background representations then computes anomaly scores for a variety of signals in the representation space. With AnomalyCLR we find significant improvements on performance metrics for all signals when compared to the raw data baseline. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper discusses the capacity of graph neural networks to learn the functional form of ordinary differential equations that govern dynamics on complex networks. We propose necessary elements for such a problem, namely, inductive biases, a neural network architecture and a learning task. Statistical learning theory suggests that generalisation power of neural networks relies on independence and identical distribution (i.i.d.)\ of training and testing data. Although this assumption together with an appropriate neural architecture and a learning mechanism is sufficient for accurate out-of-sample predictions of dynamics such as, e.g.\ mass-action kinetics, by studying the out-of-distribution generalisation in the case of diffusion dynamics, we find that the neural network model: (i) has a generalisation capacity that depends on the first moment of the initial value data distribution; (ii) learns the non-dissipative nature of dynamics implicitly; and (iii) the model's accuracy resolution limit is of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ for a system of size $n$. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
