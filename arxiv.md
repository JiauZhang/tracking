        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) of vehicles, i.e. tracking vehicles across multiple cameras, is a crucial application for the development of smart city and intelligent traffic system. The main challenges of MTMCT of vehicles include the intra-class variability of the same vehicle and inter-class similarity between different vehicles and how to associate the same vehicle accurately across different cameras under large search space. Previous methods for MTMCT usually use hierarchical clustering of trajectories to conduct cross camera association. However, the search space can be large and does not take spatial and temporal information into consideration. In this paper, we proposed a transformer-based camera link model with spatial and temporal filtering to conduct cross camera tracking. Achieving 73.68% IDF1 on the Nvidia Cityflow V2 dataset test set, showing the effectiveness of our camera link model on multi-target multi-camera tracking. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self supervision and natural language supervision have emerged as two exciting ways to train general purpose image encoders which excel at a variety of downstream tasks. Recent works such as M3AE and SLIP have suggested that these approaches can be effectively combined, but most notably their results use small pre-training datasets (&lt;50M samples) and don't effectively reflect the large-scale regime (&gt;100M examples) that is commonly used for these approaches. Here we investigate whether a similar approach can be effective when trained with a much larger amount of data. We find that a combination of two state of the art approaches: masked auto-encoders, MAE and contrastive language image pre-training, CLIP provides a benefit over CLIP when trained on a corpus of 11.3M image-text pairs, but little to no benefit (as evaluated on a suite of common vision tasks) over CLIP when trained on a large corpus of 1.4B images. Our work provides some much needed clarity into the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of self supervision for large-scale image-text training. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model to perform well even on unseen domains. For many real-world machine learning applications, the data distribution often shifts gradually along domain indices. For example, a self-driving car with a vision system drives from dawn to dusk, with the sky darkening gradually. Therefore, the system must be able to adapt to changes in ambient illumination and continue to drive safely on the road. In this paper, we formulate such problems as Evolving Domain Generalization, where a model aims to generalize well on a target domain by discovering and leveraging the evolving pattern of the environment. We then propose Directional Domain Augmentation (DDA), which simulates the unseen target features by mapping source data as augmentations through a domain transformer. Specifically, we formulate DDA as a bi-level optimization problem and solve it through a novel meta-learning approach in the representation space. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic datasets and realworld datasets, and empirical results show that our approach can outperform other existing methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Constructing click models and extracting implicit relevance feedback information from the interaction between users and search engines are very important to improve the ranking of search results. Using neural network to model users' click behaviors has become one of the effective methods to construct click models. In this paper, We use Transformer as the backbone network of feature extraction, add filter layer innovatively, and propose a new Filter-Enhanced Transformer Click Model (FE-TCM) for web search. Firstly, in order to reduce the influence of noise on user behavior data, we use the learnable filters to filter log noise. Secondly, following the examination hypothesis, we model the attraction estimator and examination predictor respectively to output the attractiveness scores and examination probabilities. A novel transformer model is used to learn the deeper representation among different features. Finally, we apply the combination functions to integrate attractiveness scores and examination probabilities into the click prediction. From our experiments on two real-world session datasets, it is proved that FE-TCM outperforms the existing click models for the click prediction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: State-of-the-art video-text retrieval (VTR) methods usually fully fine-tune the pre-trained model (e.g. CLIP) on specific datasets, which may suffer from substantial storage costs in practical applications since a separate model per task needs to be stored. To overcome this issue, we present the premier work on performing parameter-efficient VTR from the pre-trained model, i.e., only a small number of parameters are tunable while freezing the backbone. Towards this goal, we propose a new method dubbed Multimodal Video Adapter (MV-Adapter) for efficiently transferring the knowledge in the pre-trained CLIP from image-text to video-text. Specifically, MV-Adapter adopts bottleneck structures in both video and text branches and introduces two novel components. The first is a Temporal Adaptation Module employed in the video branch to inject global and local temporal contexts. We also learn weights calibrations to adapt to the dynamic variations across frames. The second is a Cross-Modal Interaction Module that generates weights for video/text branches through a shared parameter space, for better aligning between modalities. Thanks to above innovations, MV-Adapter can achieve on-par or better performance than standard fine-tuning with negligible parameters overhead. Notably, on five widely used VTR benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet), MV-Adapter consistently outperforms various competing methods in V2T/T2V tasks with large margins. Codes will be released. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper provide several mathematical analyses of the diffusion model in machine learning. The drift term of the backwards sampling process is represented as a conditional expectation involving the data distribution and the forward diffusion. The training process aims to find such a drift function by minimizing the mean-squared residue related to the conditional expectation. Using small-time approximations of the Green's function of the forward diffusion, we show that the analytical mean drift function in DDPM and the score function in SGM asymptotically blow up in the final stages of the sampling process for singular data distributions such as those concentrated on lower-dimensional manifolds, and is therefore difficult to approximate by a network. To overcome this difficulty, we derive a new target function and associated loss, which remains bounded even for singular data distributions. We illustrate the theoretical findings with several numerical examples. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Spatial and temporal modeling is one of the most core aspects of few-shot action recognition. Most previous works mainly focus on long-term temporal relation modeling based on high-level spatial representations, without considering the crucial low-level spatial features and short-term temporal relations. Actually, the former feature could bring rich local semantic information, and the latter feature could represent motion characteristics of adjacent frames, respectively. In this paper, we propose SloshNet, a new framework that revisits the spatial and temporal modeling for few-shot action recognition in a finer manner. First, to exploit the low-level spatial features, we design a feature fusion architecture search module to automatically search for the best combination of the low-level and high-level spatial features. Next, inspired by the recent transformer, we introduce a long-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based on the extracted spatial appearance features. Meanwhile, we design another short-term temporal modeling module to encode the motion characteristics between adjacent frame representations. After that, the final predictions can be obtained by feeding the embedded rich spatial-temporal features to a common frame-level class prototype matcher. We extensively validate the proposed SloshNet on four few-shot action recognition datasets, including Something-Something V2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. It achieves favorable results against state-of-the-art methods in all datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in traffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. However, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction: i) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the ability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider short-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial dependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of traffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To this end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range transFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to highlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a traffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower PDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial information propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world public traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map to make our model highly interpretable. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Radiance fields have gradually become a main representation of media. Although its appearance editing has been studied, how to achieve view-consistent recoloring in an efficient manner is still under explored. We present RecolorNeRF, a novel user-friendly color editing approach for the neural radiance field. Our key idea is to decompose the scene into a set of pure-colored layers, forming a palette. Thus, color manipulation can be conducted by altering the color components of the palette directly. To support efficient palette-based editing, the color of each layer needs to be as representative as possible. In the end, the problem is formulated as in an optimization formula, where the layers and their blending way are jointly optimized with the NeRF itself. Extensive experiments show that our jointly-optimized layer decomposition can be used against multiple backbones and produce photo-realistic recolored novel-view renderings. We demonstrate that RecolorNeRF outperforms baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively for color editing even in complex real-world scenes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have become a popular tool for generating high-quality samples from complex data distributions. These models are able to capture sophisticated patterns and structures in the data, and can generate samples that are highly diverse and representative of the underlying distribution. However, one of the main limitations of diffusion models is the complexity of sample generation, since a large number of inference timesteps is required to faithfully capture the data distribution. In this paper, we present MMD-DDM, a novel method for fast sampling of diffusion models. Our approach is based on the idea of using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to finetune the learned distribution with a given budget of timesteps. This allows the finetuned model to significantly improve the speed-quality trade-off, by substantially increasing fidelity in inference regimes with few steps or, equivalently, by reducing the required number of steps to reach a target fidelity, thus paving the way for a more practical adoption of diffusion models in a wide range of applications. We evaluate our approach on unconditional image generation with extensive experiments across the CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet and LSUN-Church datasets. Our findings show that the proposed method is able to produce high-quality samples in a fraction of the time required by widely-used diffusion models, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for accelerated sampling.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel method that trains a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate visual interpretations of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To comprehend a CNN, the GAN is trained with information on how the CNN processes an image when making predictions. Supplying that information has two main challenges: how to represent this information in a form that is feedable to the GANs and how to effectively feed the representation to the GAN. To address these issues, we developed a suitable representation of CNN architectures by cumulatively averaging intermediate interpretation maps. We also propose two alternative approaches to feed the representations to the GAN and to choose an effective training strategy. Our approach learned the general aspects of CNNs and was agnostic to datasets and CNN architectures. The study includes both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compares the proposed GANs with state-of-the-art approaches. We found that the initial layers of CNNs and final layers are equally crucial for interpreting CNNs upon interpreting the proposed GAN. We believe training a GAN to interpret CNNs would open doors for improved interpretations by leveraging fast-paced deep learning advancements.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Color plays an important role in human visual perception, reflecting the spectrum of objects. However, the existing infrared and visible image fusion methods rarely explore how to handle multi-spectral/channel data directly and achieve high color fidelity. This paper addresses the above issue by proposing a novel method with diffusion models, termed as Dif-Fusion, to generate the distribution of the multi-channel input data, which increases the ability of multi-source information aggregation and the fidelity of colors. In specific, instead of converting multi-channel images into single-channel data in existing fusion methods, we create the multi-channel data distribution with a denoising network in a latent space with forward and reverse diffusion process. Then, we use the the denoising network to extract the multi-channel diffusion features with both visible and infrared information. Finally, we feed the multi-channel diffusion features to the multi-channel fusion module to directly generate the three-channel fused image. To retain the texture and intensity information, we propose multi-channel gradient loss and intensity loss. Along with the current evaluation metrics for measuring texture and intensity fidelity, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify color fidelity. Extensive experiments indicate that our method is more effective than other state-of-the-art image fusion methods, especially in color fidelity. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and transformers are increasingly popular in histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, unlike human pathologists who selectively observe specific regions of histopathology tissues under different magnifications, most methods do not incorporate multiple resolutions of the WSIs, hierarchically and attentively, thereby leading to a loss of focus on the WSIs and information from other resolutions. To resolve this issue, we propose the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning framework to fully exploit the WSIs, which can dynamically and attentively discover the discriminative regions across multiple resolutions of the WSIs. Within this framework, to further enhance the performance of the transformer and obtain a more holistic WSI (bag) representation, we propose an Integrated Attention Transformer, consisting of multiple Integrated Attention Modules, which is the combination of a transformer layer and an aggregation module that produces a bag representation based on every instance representation in that bag. The results of the experiments show that our method achieved state-of-the-art performances on multiple datasets, including Camelyon16, TCGA-RCC, TCGA-NSCLC, and our in-house IMGC dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

To this end, we propose SwiftAvatar, a novel avatar auto-creation framework that is evidently superior to previous works. SwiftAvatar introduces dual-domain generators to create pairs of realistic faces and avatar images using shared latent codes. The latent codes can then be bridged with the avatar vectors as pairs, by performing GAN inversion on the avatar images rendered from the engine using avatar vectors. Through this way, we are able to synthesize paired data in high-quality as many as possible, consisting of avatar vectors and their corresponding realistic faces. We also propose semantic augmentation to improve the diversity of synthesis. Finally, a light-weight avatar vector estimator is trained on the synthetic pairs to implement efficient auto-creation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftAvatar on two different avatar engines. The superiority and advantageous flexibility of SwiftAvatar are also verified in both subjective and objective evaluations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the vast data-collecting capabilities of current and future high-energy collider experiments, there is an increasing demand for computationally efficient simulations. Generative machine learning models enable fast event generation, yet so far these approaches are largely constrained to fixed data structures and rigid detector geometries. In this paper, we introduce EPiC-GAN - equivariant point cloud generative adversarial network - which can produce point clouds of variable multiplicity. This flexible framework is based on deep sets and is well suited for simulating sprays of particles called jets. The generator and discriminator utilize multiple EPiC layers with an interpretable global latent vector. Crucially, the EPiC layers do not rely on pairwise information sharing between particles, which leads to a significant speed-up over graph- and transformer-based approaches with more complex relation diagrams. We demonstrate that EPiC-GAN scales well to large particle multiplicities and achieves high generation fidelity on benchmark jet generation tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this case study, we explore the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT, a natural language processing model developed by OpenAI, in the field of string theoretical swampland conjectures. We find that it is effective at paraphrasing and explaining concepts in a variety of styles, but not at genuinely connecting concepts. It will provide false information with full confidence and make up statements when necessary. However, its ingenious use of language can be fruitful for identifying analogies and describing visual representations of abstract concepts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: U-Net architectures are ubiquitous in state-of-the-art deep learning, however their regularisation properties and relationship to wavelets are understudied. In this paper, we formulate a multi-resolution framework which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space. We provide theoretical results which prove that average pooling corresponds to projection within the space of square-integrable functions and show that U-Nets with average pooling implicitly learn a Haar wavelet basis representation of the data. We then leverage our framework to identify state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs), which have a U-Net architecture, as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi-resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities. We also demonstrate that HVAEs learn a representation of time which allows for improved parameter efficiency through weight-sharing. We use this observation to achieve state-of-the-art HVAE performance with half the number of parameters of existing models, exploiting the properties of our continuous-time formulation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Synthetic data generation is a promising solution to address privacy issues with the distribution of sensitive health data. Recently, diffusion models have set new standards for generative models for different data modalities. Also very recently, structured state space models emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm to capture long-term dependencies in time series. We put forward SSSD-ECG, as the combination of these two technologies, for the generation of synthetic 12-lead electrocardiograms conditioned on more than 70 ECG statements. Due to a lack of reliable baselines, we also propose conditional variants of two state-of-the-art unconditional generative models. We thoroughly evaluate the quality of the generated samples, by evaluating pretrained classifiers on the generated data and by evaluating the performance of a classifier trained only on synthetic data, where SSSD-ECG clearly outperforms its GAN-based competitors. We demonstrate the soundness of our approach through further experiments, including conditional class interpolation and a clinical Turing test demonstrating the high quality of the SSSD-ECG samples across a wide range of conditions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
