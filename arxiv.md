        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, ChatGPT has attracted great attention, as it can generate fluent and high-quality responses to human inquiries. Several prior studies have shown that ChatGPT attains remarkable generation ability compared with existing models. However, the quantitative analysis of ChatGPT's understanding ability has been given little attention. In this report, we explore the understanding ability of ChatGPT by evaluating it on the most popular GLUE benchmark, and comparing it with 4 representative fine-tuned BERT-style models. We find that: 1) ChatGPT falls short in handling paraphrase and similarity tasks; 2) ChatGPT outperforms all BERT models on inference tasks by a large margin; 3) ChatGPT achieves comparable performance compared with BERT on sentiment analysis and question answering tasks. Additionally, several bad cases from inference tasks show the potential limitation of ChatGPT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key step in the creation of structured data from digitised historical documents. Traditional NER approaches deal with flat named entities, whereas entities often are nested. For example, a postal address might contain a street name and a number. This work compares three nested NER approaches, including two state-of-the-art approaches using Transformer-based architectures. We introduce a new Transformer-based approach based on joint labelling and semantic weighting of errors, evaluated on a collection of 19 th-century Paris trade directories. We evaluate approaches regarding the impact of supervised fine-tuning, unsupervised pre-training with noisy texts, and variation of IOB tagging formats. Our results show that while nested NER approaches enable extracting structured data directly, they do not benefit from the extra knowledge provided during training and reach a performance similar to the base approach on flat entities. Even though all 3 approaches perform well in terms of F1 scores, joint labelling is most suitable for hierarchically structured data. Finally, our experiments reveal the superiority of the IO tagging format on such data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Zero-shot information extraction (IE) aims to build IE systems from the unannotated text. It is challenging due to involving little human intervention. Challenging but worthwhile, zero-shot IE reduces the time and effort that data labeling takes. Recent efforts on large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-3, ChatGPT) show promising performance on zero-shot settings, thus inspiring us to explore prompt-based methods. In this work, we ask whether strong IE models can be constructed by directly prompting LLMs. Specifically, we transform the zero-shot IE task into a multi-turn question-answering problem with a two-stage framework (ChatIE). With the power of ChatGPT, we extensively evaluate our framework on three IE tasks: entity-relation triple extract, named entity recognition, and event extraction. Empirical results on six datasets across two languages show that ChatIE achieves impressive performance and even surpasses some full-shot models on several datasets (e.g., NYT11-HRL). We believe that our work could shed light on building IE models with limited resources. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning models have been widely applied for fast MRI. The majority of existing deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks, work on data with Euclidean or regular grids structures. However, high-dimensional features extracted from MR data could be encapsulated in non-Euclidean manifolds. This disparity between the go-to assumption of existing models and data requirements limits the flexibility to capture irregular anatomical features in MR data. In this work, we introduce a novel Vision GNN type network for fast MRI called Vision GNN U-Net (ViGU). More precisely, the pixel array is first embedded into patches and then converted into a graph. Secondly, a U-shape network is developed using several graph blocks in symmetrical encoder and decoder paths. Moreover, we show that the proposed ViGU can also benefit from Generative Adversarial Networks yielding to its variant ViGU-GAN. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that the proposed ViGU and GAN variant outperform existing CNN and GAN-based methods. Moreover, we show that the proposed network readily competes with approaches based on Transformers while requiring a fraction of the computational cost. More importantly, the graph structure of the network reveals how the network extracts features from MR images, providing intuitive explainability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a new Tipping Point Generative Adversarial Network (TIP-GAN) for better characterizing potential climate tipping points in Earth system models. We describe an adversarial game to explore the parameter space of these models, detect upcoming tipping points, and discover the drivers of tipping points. In this setup, a set of generators learn to construct model configurations that will invoke a climate tipping point. The discriminator learns to identify which generators are generating each model configuration and whether a given configuration will lead to a tipping point. The discriminator is trained using an oracle (a surrogate climate model) to test if a generated model configuration leads to a tipping point or not. We demonstrate the application of this GAN to invoke the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We share experimental results of modifying the loss functions and the number of generators to exploit the area of uncertainty in model state space near a climate tipping point. In addition, we show that our trained discriminator can predict AMOC collapse with a high degree of accuracy without the use of the oracle. This approach could generalize to other tipping points, and could augment climate modeling research by directing users interested in studying tipping points to parameter sets likely to induce said tipping points in their computationally intensive climate models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: One of the techniques for estimating the surface particle concentration with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) is using aerosol optical depth (AOD) products. Different AOD products are retrieved from various satellite sensors, like MODIS and VIIRS, by various algorithms, such as Deep Blue and Dark Target. Therefore, they do not have the same accuracy and spatial resolution. Additionally, the weakness of algorithms in AOD retrieval reduces the spatial coverage of products, particularly in cloudy or snowy areas. Consequently, for the first time, the present study investigated the possibility of fusing AOD products from observations of MODIS and VIIRS sensors retrieved by Deep Blue and Dark Target algorithms to estimate PM2.5 more accurately. For this purpose, AOD products were fused by machine learning algorithms using different fusion strategies at two levels: the data level and the decision level. First, the performance of various machine learning algorithms for estimating PM2.5 using AOD data was evaluated. After that, the XGBoost algorithm was selected as the base model for the proposed fusion strategies. Then, AOD products were fused. The fusion results showed that the estimated PM2.5 accuracy at the data level in all three metrics, RMSE, MAE, and R2, was improved (R2=0.64). Despite the simplicity and lower computational cost of the data level fusion method, the spatial coverage did not improve considerably due to eliminating poor quality data through the fusion process. Afterward, the fusion of products at the decision level was followed in eleven scenarios. In this way, the best result was obtained by fusing Deep Blue products of MODIS and VIIRS sensors (R2=0.81) <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing language and vision models achieve impressive performance in image-text understanding. Yet, it is an open question to what extent they can be used for language understanding in 3D environments and whether they implicitly acquire 3D object knowledge, e.g. about different views of an object. In this paper, we investigate whether a state-of-the-art language and vision model, CLIP, is able to ground perspective descriptions of a 3D object and identify canonical views of common objects based on text queries. We present an evaluation framework that uses a circling camera around a 3D object to generate images from different viewpoints and evaluate them in terms of their similarity to natural language descriptions. We find that a pre-trained CLIP model performs poorly on most canonical views and that fine-tuning using hard negative sampling and random contrasting yields good results even under conditions with little available training data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Lipschitz bounded neural networks are certifiably robust and have a good trade-off between clean and certified accuracy. Existing Lipschitz bounding methods train from scratch and are limited to moderately sized networks (&lt; 6M parameters). They require a fair amount of hyper-parameter tuning and are computationally prohibitive for large networks like Vision Transformers (5M to 660M parameters). Obtaining certified robustness of transformers is not feasible due to the non-scalability and inflexibility of the current methods. This work presents CertViT, a two-step proximal-projection method to achieve certified robustness from pre-trained weights. The proximal step tries to lower the Lipschitz bound and the projection step tries to maintain the clean accuracy of pre-trained weights. We show that CertViT networks have better certified accuracy than state-of-the-art Lipschitz trained networks. We apply CertViT on several variants of pre-trained vision transformers and show adversarial robustness using standard attacks.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful and ubiquitous in mainstream applications such as being a personal assistant, a dialogue model, etc. As these models become proficient in deducing user preferences and offering tailored assistance, there is an increasing concern about the ability of these models to influence, modify and in the extreme case manipulate user preference adversarially. The issue of lack of interpretability in these models in adversarial settings remains largely unsolved. This work tries to study adversarial behavior in user preferences from the lens of attention probing, red teaming and white-box analysis. Specifically, it provides a bird's eye view of existing literature, offers red teaming samples for dialogue models like ChatGPT and GODEL and probes the attention mechanism in the latter for non-adversarial and adversarial settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Latest works delivered further improvements by incorporating different objectives such as masked modeling and captioning into the frameworks, but our understanding on how these objectives facilitate learning remains vastly incomplete. In this paper, we leverage the fact that classifier-guided diffusion models generate images that reflect the semantic signals provided by the classifier to study the characteristics of multimodal learning objectives. Specifically, we compare contrastive, matching and captioning loss in terms of their semantic signals, and introduce a simple baseline that not only supports our analyses but also improves the quality of generative guidance in a straightforward manner. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Unsupervised out-of-distribution detection (OOD) seeks to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled in-domain data. We present a novel approach for this task - Lift, Map, Detect (LMD) - that leverages recent advancement in diffusion models. Diffusion models are one type of generative models. At their core, they learn an iterative denoising process that gradually maps a noisy image closer to their training manifolds. LMD leverages this intuition for OOD detection. Specifically, LMD lifts an image off its original manifold by corrupting it, and maps it towards the in-domain manifold with a diffusion model. For an out-of-domain image, the mapped image would have a large distance away from its original manifold, and LMD would identify it as OOD accordingly. We show through extensive experiments that LMD achieves competitive performance across a broad variety of datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication technique that uses molecules to encode and transfer information. Many efforts have been devoted to developing novel modulation techniques for MC based on various distinguishable characteristics of molecules, such as their concentrations or types. In this paper, we investigate a particular modulation scheme called Ratio Shift Keying (RSK), where the information is encoded in the concentration ratio of two different types of molecules. RSK modulation is hypothesized to enable accurate information transfer in dynamic MC scenarios where the time-varying channel characteristics affect both types of molecules equally. To validate this hypothesis, we first conduct an information-theoretical analysis of RSK modulation and derive the capacity of the end-to-end MC channel where the receiver estimates concentration ratio based on ligand-receptor binding statistics in an optimal or suboptimal manner. We then analyze the error performance of RSK modulation in a practical time-varying MC scenario, that is mobile MC, in which both the transmitter and the receiver undergo diffusion-based propagation. Our numerical and analytical results, obtained for varying levels of similarity between the ligand types used for ratio-encoding, and varying number of receptors, show that RSK can significantly outperform the most commonly considered MC modulation technique, concentration shift keying (CSK), in dynamic MC scenarios. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The rapidly increasing size of deep-learning models has caused renewed and growing interest in alternatives to digital computers to dramatically reduce the energy cost of running state-of-the-art neural networks. Optical matrix-vector multipliers are best suited to performing computations with very large operands, which suggests that large Transformer models could be a good target for optical computing. To test this idea, we performed small-scale optical experiments with a prototype accelerator to demonstrate that Transformer operations can run on optical hardware despite noise and errors. Using simulations, validated by our experiments, we then explored the energy efficiency of optical implementations of Transformers and identified scaling laws for model performance with respect to optical energy usage. We found that the optical energy per multiply-accumulate (MAC) scales as $\frac{1}{d}$ where $d$ is the Transformer width, an asymptotic advantage over digital systems. We conclude that with well-engineered, large-scale optical hardware, it may be possible to achieve a $100 \times$ energy-efficiency advantage for running some of the largest current Transformer models, and that if both the models and the optical hardware are scaled to the quadrillion-parameter regime, optical computers could have a $&gt;8,000\times$ energy-efficiency advantage over state-of-the-art digital-electronic processors that achieve 300 fJ/MAC. We analyzed how these results motivate and inform the construction of future optical accelerators along with optics-amenable deep-learning approaches. With assumptions about future improvements to electronics and Transformer quantization techniques (5$\times$ cheaper memory access, double the digital--analog conversion efficiency, and 4-bit precision), we estimated that optical computers' advantage against current 300-fJ/MAC digital processors could grow to $&gt;100,000\times$. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: NLP-based computer vision models, particularly vision transformers, have been shown to outperform CNN models in many imaging tasks. However, most digital pathology artificial-intelligence models are based on CNN architectures, probably owing to a lack of data regarding NLP models for pathology images. In this study, we developed digital pathology pipelines to benchmark the five most recently proposed NLP models (vision transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, MobileViT, CMT, and Sequencer2D) and four popular CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet) to predict biomarkers in colorectal cancer (microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and BRAF mutation). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images from Molecular and Cellular Oncology and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used as training and external validation datasets, respectively. Cross-study external validations revealed that the NLP-based models significantly outperformed the CNN-based models in biomarker prediction tasks, improving the overall prediction and precision up to approximately 10% and 26%, respectively. Notably, compared with existing models in the current literature using large training datasets, our NLP models achieved state-of-the-art predictions for all three biomarkers using a relatively small training dataset, suggesting that large training datasets are not a prerequisite for NLP models or transformers, and NLP may be more suitable for clinical studies in which small training datasets are commonly collected. The superior performance of Sequencer2D suggests that further research and innovation on both transformer and bidirectional long short-term memory architectures are warranted in the field of digital pathology. NLP models can replace classic CNN architectures and become the new workhorse backbone in the field of digital pathology. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Node classification is a substantial problem in graph-based fraud detection. Many existing works adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance fraud detectors. While promising, currently most GNN-based fraud detectors fail to generalize to the low homophily setting. Besides, label utilization has been proved to be significant factor for node classification problem. But we find they are less effective in fraud detection tasks due to the low homophily in graphs. In this work, we propose GAGA, a novel Group AGgregation enhanced TrAnsformer, to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, the group aggregation provides a portable method to cope with the low homophily issue. Such an aggregation explicitly integrates the label information to generate distinguishable neighborhood information. Along with group aggregation, an attempt towards end-to-end trainable group encoding is proposed which augments the original feature space with the class labels. Meanwhile, we devise two additional learnable encodings to recognize the structural and relational context. Then, we combine the group aggregation and the learnable encodings into a Transformer encoder to capture the semantic information. Experimental results clearly show that GAGA outperforms other competitive graph-based fraud detectors by up to 24.39% on two trending public datasets and a real-world industrial dataset from Anonymous. Even more, the group aggregation is demonstrated to outperform other label utilization methods (e.g., C&amp;S, BoT/UniMP) in the low homophily setting. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer-based language models have achieved significant success in various domains. However, the data-intensive nature of the transformer architecture requires much labeled data, which is challenging in low-resource scenarios (i.e., few-shot learning (FSL)). The main challenge of FSL is the difficulty of training robust models on small amounts of samples, which frequently leads to overfitting. Here we present Mask-BERT, a simple and modular framework to help BERT-based architectures tackle FSL. The proposed approach fundamentally differs from existing FSL strategies such as prompt tuning and meta-learning. The core idea is to selectively apply masks on text inputs and filter out irrelevant information, which guides the model to focus on discriminative tokens that influence prediction results. In addition, to make the text representations from different categories more separable and the text representations from the same category more compact, we introduce a contrastive learning loss function. Experimental results on public-domain benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Mask-BERT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Physics-informed deep learning have recently emerged as an effective tool for leveraging both observational data and available physical laws. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets) are two such models. The former encodes the physical laws via the automatic differentiation, while the latter learns the hidden physics from data. Generally, the noisy and limited observational data as well as the overparameterization in neural networks (NNs) result in uncertainty in predictions from deep learning models. In [1], a Bayesian framework based on the {{Generative Adversarial Networks}} (GAN) has been proposed as a unified model to quantify uncertainties in predictions of PINNs as well as DeepONets. Specifically, the proposed approach in [1] has two stages: (1) prior learning, and (2) posterior estimation. At the first stage, the GANs are employed to learn a functional prior either from a prescribed function distribution, e.g., Gaussian process, or from historical data and available physics. At the second stage, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method is utilized to estimate the posterior in the latent space of GANs. However, the vanilla HMC does not support the mini-batch training, which limits its applications in problems with big data. In the present work, we propose to use the normalizing flow (NF) models in the context of variational inference, which naturally enables the minibatch training, as the alternative to HMC for posterior estimation in the latent space of GANs. A series of numerical experiments, including a nonlinear differential equation problem and a 100-dimensional Darcy problem, are conducted to demonstrate that NF with full-/mini-batch training are able to achieve similar accuracy as the ``gold rule'' HMC. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Understanding seasonal climatic conditions is critical for better management of resources such as water, energy and agriculture. Recently, there has been a great interest in utilizing the power of artificial intelligence methods in climate studies. This paper presents a cutting-edge deep learning model (UNet++) trained by state-of-the-art global CMIP6 models to forecast global temperatures a month ahead using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. ERA5 dataset was also used for finetuning as well performance analysis in the validation dataset. Three different setups (CMIP6; CMIP6 + elevation; CMIP6 + elevation + ERA5 finetuning) were used with both UNet and UNet++ algorithms resulting in six different models. For each model 14 different sequential and non-sequential temporal settings were used. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) analysis revealed that UNet++ with CMIP6 with elevation and ERA5 finetuning model with "Year 3 Month 2" temporal case provided the best outcome with an MAE of 0.7. Regression analysis over the validation dataset between the ERA5 data values and the corresponding AI model predictions revealed slope and $R^2$ values close to 1 suggesting a very good agreement. The AI model predicts significantly better than the mean CMIP6 ensemble between 2016 and 2021. Both models predict the summer months more accurately than the winter months. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown prominence for semantic segmentation. Although CNN models have very impressive performance, the ability to capture global representation is still insufficient, which results in suboptimal results. Recently, Transformer achieved huge success in NLP tasks, demonstrating its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. Recently, Transformer has also attracted tremendous attention from computer vision researchers who reformulate the image processing tasks as a sequence-to-sequence prediction but resulted in deteriorating local feature details. In this work, we propose a lightweight real-time semantic segmentation network called LETNet. LETNet combines a U-shaped CNN with Transformer effectively in a capsule embedding style to compensate for respective deficiencies. Meanwhile, the elaborately designed Lightweight Dilated Bottleneck (LDB) module and Feature Enhancement (FE) module cultivate a positive impact on training from scratch simultaneously. Extensive experiments performed on challenging datasets demonstrate that LETNet achieves superior performances in accuracy and efficiency balance. Specifically, It only contains 0.95M parameters and 13.6G FLOPs but yields 72.8\% mIoU at 120 FPS on the Cityscapes test set and 70.5\% mIoU at 250 FPS on the CamVid test dataset using a single RTX 3090 GPU.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A common problem when forecasting rare events, such as recessions, is limited data availability. Recent advancements in deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) make it possible to produce high-fidelity synthetic data in large quantities. This paper uses a model called DoppelGANger, a GAN tailored to producing synthetic time series data, to generate synthetic Treasury yield time series and associated recession indicators. It is then shown that short-range forecasting performance for Treasury yields is improved for models trained on synthetic data relative to models trained only on real data. Finally, synthetic recession conditions are produced and used to train classification models to predict the probability of a future recession. It is shown that training models on synthetic recessions can improve a model's ability to predict future recessions over a model trained only on real data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper studies graph-structured prediction for supervised learning on graphs with node-wise or edge-wise target dependencies. To solve this problem, recent works investigated combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with conventional structured prediction algorithms like conditional random fields. However, in this work, we pursue an alternative direction building on the recent successes of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). That is, we propose a new framework using DPMs to make graph-structured predictions. In the fully supervised setting, our DPM captures the target dependencies by iteratively updating each target estimate based on the estimates of nearby targets. We also propose a variational expectation maximization algorithm to train our DPM in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments verify that our framework consistently outperforms existing neural structured prediction models on inductive and transductive node classification. We also demonstrate the competitive performance of our framework for algorithmic reasoning tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multi-view radar-camera fused 3D object detection provides a farther detection range and more helpful features for autonomous driving, especially under adverse weather. The current radar-camera fusion methods deliver kinds of designs to fuse radar information with camera data. However, these fusion approaches usually adopt the straightforward concatenation operation between multi-modal features, which ignores the semantic alignment with radar features and sufficient correlations across modals. In this paper, we present MVFusion, a novel Multi-View radar-camera Fusion method to achieve semantic-aligned radar features and enhance the cross-modal information interaction. To achieve so, we inject the semantic alignment into the radar features via the semantic-aligned radar encoder (SARE) to produce image-guided radar features. Then, we propose the radar-guided fusion transformer (RGFT) to fuse our radar and image features to strengthen the two modals' correlation from the global scope via the cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that MVFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance (51.7% NDS and 45.3% mAP) on the nuScenes dataset. We shall release our code and trained networks upon publication. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Monocular 3D object detection reveals an economical but challenging task in autonomous driving. Recently center-based monocular methods have developed rapidly with a great trade-off between speed and accuracy, where they usually depend on the object center's depth estimation via 2D features. However, the visual semantic features without sufficient pixel geometry information, may affect the performance of clues for spatial 3D detection tasks. To alleviate this, we propose MonoPGC, a novel end-to-end Monocular 3D object detection framework with rich Pixel Geometry Contexts. We introduce the pixel depth estimation as our auxiliary task and design depth cross-attention pyramid module (DCPM) to inject local and global depth geometry knowledge into visual features. In addition, we present the depth-space-aware transformer (DSAT) to integrate 3D space position and depth-aware features efficiently. Besides, we design a novel depth-gradient positional encoding (DGPE) to bring more distinct pixel geometry contexts into the transformer for better object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Semantic consistency recognition aims to detect and judge whether the semantics of two text sentences are consistent with each other. However, the existing methods usually encounter the challenges of synonyms, polysemy and difficulty to understand long text. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a co-driven semantic consistency recognition method based on the fusion of Transformer and HowNet sememes knowledge. Multi-level encoding of internal sentence structures via data-driven is carried out firstly by Transformer, sememes knowledge base HowNet is introduced for knowledge-driven to model the semantic knowledge association among sentence pairs. Then, interactive attention calculation is carried out utilizing soft-attention and fusion the knowledge with sememes matrix. Finally, bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is exploited to encode the conceptual semantic information and infer the semantic consistency. Experiments are conducted on two financial text matching datasets (BQ, AFQMC) and a cross-lingual adversarial dataset (PAWSX) for paraphrase identification. Compared with lightweight models including DSSM, MwAN, DRCN, and pre-training models such as ERNIE etc., the proposed model can not only improve the accuracy of semantic consistency recognition effectively (by 2.19%, 5.57% and 6.51% compared with the DSSM, MWAN and DRCN models on the BQ dataset), but also reduce the number of model parameters (to about 16M). In addition, driven by the HowNet sememes knowledge, the proposed method is promising to adapt to scenarios with long text. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Whole slide image (WSI) has been widely used to assist automated diagnosis under the deep learning fields. However, most previous works only discuss the SINGLE task setting which is not aligned with real clinical setting, where pathologists often conduct multiple diagnosis tasks simultaneously. Also, it is commonly recognized that the multi-task learning paradigm can improve learning efficiency by exploiting commonalities and differences across multiple tasks. To this end, we present a novel multi-task framework (i.e., MulGT) for WSI analysis by the specially designed Graph-Transformer equipped with Task-aware Knowledge Injection and Domain Knowledge-driven Graph Pooling modules. Basically, with the Graph Neural Network and Transformer as the building commons, our framework is able to learn task-agnostic low-level local information as well as task-specific high-level global representation. Considering that different tasks in WSI analysis depend on different features and properties, we also design a novel Task-aware Knowledge Injection module to transfer the task-shared graph embedding into task-specific feature spaces to learn more accurate representation for different tasks. Further, we elaborately design a novel Domain Knowledge-driven Graph Pooling module for each task to improve both the accuracy and robustness of different tasks by leveraging different diagnosis patterns of multiple tasks. We evaluated our method on two public WSI datasets from TCGA projects, i.e., esophageal carcinoma and kidney carcinoma. Experimental results show that our method outperforms single-task counterparts and the state-of-theart methods on both tumor typing and staging tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a three-stage training strategy called dual pseudo training (DPT) for conditional image generation and classification in semi-supervised learning. First, a classifier is trained on partially labeled data and predicts pseudo labels for all data. Second, a conditional generative model is trained on all data with pseudo labels and generates pseudo images given labels. Finally, the classifier is trained on real data augmented by pseudo images with labels. We demonstrate large-scale diffusion models and semi-supervised learners benefit mutually with a few labels via DPT. In particular, on the ImageNet 256x256 generation benchmark, DPT can generate realistic, diverse, and semantically correct images with very few labels. With two (i.e., &lt; 0.2%) and five (i.e., &lt; 0.4%) labels per class, DPT achieves an FID of 3.44 and 3.37 respectively, outperforming strong diffusion models with full labels, such as IDDPM, CDM, ADM, and LDM. Besides, DPT outperforms competitive semi-supervised baselines substantially on ImageNet classification benchmarks with one, two, and five labels per class, achieving state-of-the-art top-1 accuracies of 59.0 (+2.8), 69.5 (+3.0), and 73.6 (+1.2) respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we explore the application of language and speech technology to open-ended questions in a Dutch panel survey. In an experimental wave respondents could choose to answer open questions via speech or keyboard. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) was used to process spoken responses. We evaluated answers from these input modalities to investigate differences between spoken and typed answers.We report the errors the ASR system produces and investigate the impact of these errors on downstream analyses. Open-ended questions give more freedom to answer for respondents, but entail a non-trivial amount of work to analyse. We evaluated the feasibility of using transformer-based models (e.g. BERT) to apply sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the answers of open questions. A big advantage of transformer-based models is that they are trained on a large amount of language materials and do not necessarily need training on the target materials. This is especially advantageous for survey data, which does not contain a lot of text materials. We tested the quality of automatic sentiment analysis by comparing automatic labeling with three human raters and tested the robustness of topic modelling by comparing the generated models based on automatic and manually transcribed spoken answers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

When you see an image of a church, you may wonder if you can get similar pictures for that church. Here we present a method, for adapting GANs with one reference image, and then we can generate images that have similar textures to the given image. Specifically, we modify the weights of the pre-trained GAN model, guided by the reference image given by the user. We use a patch discriminator adversarial loss to encourage the output of the model to match the texture on the given image, also we use a laplacian adversarial loss to ensure diversity and realism, and alleviate the contradiction between the two losses. Experiments show that the proposed method can make the outputs of GANs match the texture of the given image as well as keep diversity and realism. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Werewolf game is a social deduction game based on free natural language communication, in which players try to deceive others in order to survive. An important feature of this game is that a large portion of the conversations are false information, and the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) in such a situation has not been widely investigated. The purpose of this study is to develop an AI agent that can play Werewolf through natural language conversations. First, we collected game logs from 15 human players. Next, we fine-tuned a Transformer-based pretrained language model to construct a value network that can predict a posterior probability of winning a game at any given phase of the game and given a candidate for the next action. We then developed an AI agent that can interact with humans and choose the best voting target on the basis of its probability from the value network. Lastly, we evaluated the performance of the agent by having it actually play the game with human players. We found that our AI agent, Deep Wolf, could play Werewolf as competitively as average human players in a villager or a betrayer role, whereas Deep Wolf was inferior to human players in a werewolf or a seer role. These results suggest that current language models have the capability to suspect what others are saying, tell a lie, or detect lies in conversations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: For the task of speech separation, previous study usually treats multi-channel and single-channel scenarios as two research tracks with specialized solutions developed respectively. Instead, we propose a simple and unified architecture - DasFormer (Deep alternating spectrogram transFormer) to handle both of them in the challenging reverberant environments. Unlike frame-wise sequence modeling, each TF-bin in the spectrogram is assigned with an embedding encoding spectral and spatial information. With such input, DasFormer is then formed by multiple repetition of simple blocks each of which integrates 1) two multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules alternately processing within each frequency bin &amp; temporal frame of the spectrogram 2) MBConv before each MHSA for modeling local features on the spectrogram. Experiments show that DasFormer has a powerful ability to model the time-frequency representation, whose performance far exceeds the current SOTA models in multi-channel speech separation, and also single-channel SOTA in the more challenging yet realistic reverberation scenario. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We consider the problem of reconstructing a full 360{\deg} photographic model of an object from a single image of it. We do so by fitting a neural radiance field to the image, but find this problem to be severely ill-posed. We thus take an off-the-self conditional image generator based on diffusion and engineer a prompt that encourages it to ``dream up'' novel views of the object. Using an approach inspired by DreamFields and DreamFusion, we fuse the given input view, the conditional prior, and other regularizers in a final, consistent reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction results on benchmark images when compared to prior methods for monocular 3D reconstruction of objects. Qualitatively, our reconstructions provide a faithful match of the input view and a plausible extrapolation of its appearance and 3D shape, including to the side of the object not visible in the image. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reconstructing the 3D shape of an object from a single RGB image is a long-standing and highly challenging problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel method for single-image 3D reconstruction which generates a sparse point cloud via a conditional denoising diffusion process. Our method takes as input a single RGB image along with its camera pose and gradually denoises a set of 3D points, whose positions are initially sampled randomly from a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution, into the shape of an object. The key to our method is a geometrically-consistent conditioning process which we call projection conditioning: at each step in the diffusion process, we project local image features onto the partially-denoised point cloud from the given camera pose. This projection conditioning process enables us to generate high-resolution sparse geometries that are well-aligned with the input image, and can additionally be used to predict point colors after shape reconstruction. Moreover, due to the probabilistic nature of the diffusion process, our method is naturally capable of generating multiple different shapes consistent with a single input image. In contrast to prior work, our approach not only performs well on synthetic benchmarks, but also gives large qualitative improvements on complex real-world data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Particularly, we present an approach to encoding the dependencies in the form of relative dependency encoding (ReDE) and illustrate how to implement it in Transformers by modifying the computation of self-attention. Experimental results on four multi-party conversation benchmarks show that this framework successfully boosts the general performance of two Transformer-based language models and leads to comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved promising results in diverse generative tasks. A typical DPM framework includes a forward process that gradually diffuses the data distribution and a reverse process that recovers the data distribution from time-dependent data scores. In this work, we observe that the stochastic reverse process of data scores is a martingale, from which concentration bounds and the optional stopping theorem for data scores can be derived. Then, we discover a simple way for calibrating an arbitrary pretrained DPM, with which the score matching loss can be reduced and the lower bounds of model likelihood can consequently be increased. We provide general calibration guidelines under various model parametrizations. Our calibration method is performed only once and the resulting models can be used repeatedly for sampling. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to empirically validate our proposal. Our code is at https://github.com/thudzj/Calibrated-DPMs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Research in the field of Continual Semantic Segmentation is mainly investigating novel learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting of neural networks. Most recent publications have focused on improving learning algorithms without distinguishing effects caused by the choice of neural architecture.Therefore, we study how the choice of neural network architecture affects catastrophic forgetting in class- and domain-incremental semantic segmentation. Specifically, we compare the well-researched CNNs to recently proposed Transformers and Hybrid architectures, as well as the impact of the choice of novel normalization layers and different decoder heads. We find that traditional CNNs like ResNet have high plasticity but low stability, while transformer architectures are much more stable. When the inductive biases of CNN architectures are combined with transformers in hybrid architectures, it leads to higher plasticity and stability. The stability of these models can be explained by their ability to learn general features that are robust against distribution shifts. Experiments with different normalization layers show that Continual Normalization achieves the best trade-off in terms of adaptability and stability of the model. In the class-incremental setting, the choice of the normalization layer has much less impact. Our experiments suggest that the right choice of architecture can significantly reduce forgetting even with naive fine-tuning and confirm that for real-world applications, the architecture is an important factor in designing a continual learning model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This paper presents a system capable to work in a real time guaranteed response times and online fashion, giving an immediate response to the arise of anomalies surrounding the AV, exploiting only the videos captured by a dash-mounted camera. Our architecture, called MOVAD, relies on two main modules: a short-term memory to extract information related to the ongoing action, implemented by a Video Swin Transformer adapted to work in an online scenario, and a long-term memory module that considers also remote past information thanks to the use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. We evaluated the performance of our method on Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) dataset, a challenging collection of dash-mounted camera videos of accidents. After an extensive ablation study, MOVAD is able to reach an AUC score of 82.11%, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by +2.81 AUC.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: OpenAI has released the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and revolutionized the approach in artificial intelligence to human-model interaction. The first contact with the chatbot reveals its ability to provide detailed and precise answers in various areas. There are several publications on ChatGPT evaluation, testing its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT's capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness and stance detection, natural language inference, word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability and question answering. We automated ChatGPT's querying process and analyzed more than 38k responses. Our comparison of its results with available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability of personalizing ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI. Our results provide the basis for a fundamental discussion of whether the high quality of recent predictive NLP models can indicate a tool's usefulness to society and how the learning and validation procedures for such systems should be established. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This study evaluates how accurately markerless motion capture (MMC) with a single smartphone can measure bilateral and unilateral CMJ jump height. Methods: First, three repetitions each of bilateral and unilateral CMJ were performed by sixteen healthy adults (mean age: 30.87 $\pm$ 7.24 years; mean BMI: 23.14 $\pm$ 2.55 $kg/m^2$) on force plates and simultaneously captured using optical motion capture (OMC) and one smartphone camera. Next, MMC was performed on the smartphone videos using OpenPose. Then, we evaluated MMC in quantifying jump height using the force plate and OMC as ground truths. Results: MMC quantifies jump heights with MAE between 1.47 and 2.82 cm, and ICC between 0.84 and 0.99 without manual segmentation and camera calibration. Conclusions: Our results suggest that using a single smartphone for markerless motion capture is feasible. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Anomaly detection techniques enable effective anomaly detection and diagnosis in multi-variate time series data, which are of major significance for today's industrial applications. However, establishing an anomaly detection system that can be rapidly and accurately located is a challenging problem due to the lack of outlier tags, the high dimensional complexity of the data, memory bottlenecks in the actual hardware, and the need for fast reasoning. We have proposed an anomaly detection and diagnosis model--DTAAD in this paper, based on Transformer and Dual TCN. Our overall model will be an integrated design in which AR combines AE structures, introducing scaling methods and feedback mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy and expand correlation differences. The Dual TCN-Attention Network(DTA) constructed by us only uses a single layer of Transformer encoder in our baseline experiment, which belongs to an ultra-lightweight model. Our extensive experiments on six publicly datasets validate that DTAAD exceeds current most advanced baseline methods in both detection and diagnostic performance. Specifically, DTAAD improved F1 scores by $8.38\%$, and reduced training time by $99\%$ compared to baseline. The code and training scripts are publicly on GitHub at https://github.com/Yu-Lingrui/DTAAD. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work we investigate the numerical identification of the diffusion coefficient in elliptic and parabolic problems using neural networks. The numerical scheme is based on the standard output least-squares formulation where the Galerkin finite element method (FEM) is employed to approximate the state and neural networks (NNs) act as a smoothness prior to approximate the unknown diffusion coefficient. A projection operation is applied to the NN approximation in order to preserve the physical box constraint on the unknown coefficient. The hybrid approach enjoys both rigorous mathematical foundation of the FEM and inductive bias / approximation properties of NNs. We derive \textsl{a priori} error estimates in the standard $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the numerical reconstruction, under a positivity condition which can be verified for a large class of problem data. The error bounds depend explicitly on the noise level, regularization parameter and discretization parameters (e.g., spatial mesh size, time step size, and depth, upper bound and number of nonzero parameters of NNs). We also provide extensive numerical experiments, indicating that the hybrid method is very robust for large noise when compared with the pure FEM approximation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D photography renders a static image into a video with appealing 3D visual effects. Existing approaches typically first conduct monocular depth estimation, then render the input frame to subsequent frames with various viewpoints, and finally use an inpainting model to fill those missing/occluded regions. The inpainting model plays a crucial role in rendering quality, but it is normally trained on out-of-domain data. To reduce the training and inference gap, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion model as the inpainting module. Given a single input image, we automatically construct a training pair of the masked occluded image and the ground-truth image with random cycle-rendering. The constructed training samples are closely aligned to the testing instances, without the need of data annotation. To make full use of the masked images, we design a Masked Enhanced Block (MEB), which can be easily plugged into the UNet and enhance the semantic conditions. Towards real-world animation, we present a novel task: out-animation, which extends the space and time of input objects. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our method achieves competitive results with existing SOTA methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Estimating fluid dynamics is classically done through the simulation and integration of numerical models solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which is computationally complex and time-consuming even on high-end hardware. This is a notoriously hard problem to solve, which has recently been addressed with machine learning, in particular graph neural networks (GNN) and variants trained and evaluated on datasets of static objects in static scenes with fixed geometry. We attempt to go beyond existing work in complexity and introduce a new model, method and benchmark. We propose EAGLE, a large-scale dataset of 1.1 million 2D meshes resulting from simulations of unsteady fluid dynamics caused by a moving flow source interacting with nonlinear scene structure, comprised of 600 different scenes of three different types. To perform future forecasting of pressure and velocity on the challenging EAGLE dataset, we introduce a new mesh transformer. It leverages node clustering, graph pooling and global attention to learn long-range dependencies between spatially distant data points without needing a large number of iterations, as existing GNN methods do. We show that our transformer outperforms state-of-the-art performance on, both, existing synthetic and real datasets and on EAGLE. Finally, we highlight that our approach learns to attend to airflow, integrating complex information in a single iteration. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Bokeh rendering is a popular and effective technique used in photography to create an aesthetically pleasing effect. It is widely used to blur the background and highlight the subject in the foreground, thereby drawing the viewer's attention to the main focus of the image. In traditional digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs), this effect is achieved through the use of a large aperture lens. This allows the camera to capture images with shallow depth-of-field, in which only a small area of the image is in sharp focus, while the rest of the image is blurred. However, the hardware embedded in mobile phones is typically much smaller and more limited than that found in DSLRs. Consequently, mobile phones are not able to capture natural shallow depth-of-field photos, which can be a significant limitation for mobile photography. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel method for bokeh rendering using the Vision Transformer, a recent and powerful deep learning architecture. Our approach employs an adaptive depth calibration network that acts as a confidence level to compensate for errors in monocular depth estimation. This network is used to supervise the rendering process in conjunction with depth information, allowing for the generation of high-quality bokeh images at high resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving about 24.7% improvements on LPIPS and obtaining higher PSNR scores. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: There is a growing concern that learned conditional generative models may output samples that are substantially similar to some copyrighted data $C$ that was in their training set. We give a formal definition of $\textit{near access-freeness (NAF)}$ and prove bounds on the probability that a model satisfying this definition outputs a sample similar to $C$, even if $C$ is included in its training set. Roughly speaking, a generative model $p$ is $\textit{$k$-NAF}$ if for every potentially copyrighted data $C$, the output of $p$ diverges by at most $k$-bits from the output of a model $q$ that $\textit{did not access $C$ at all}$. We also give generative model learning algorithms, which efficiently modify the original generative model learning algorithm in a black box manner, that output generative models with strong bounds on the probability of sampling protected content. Furthermore, we provide promising experiments for both language (transformers) and image (diffusion) generative models, showing minimal degradation in output quality while ensuring strong protections against sampling protected content. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fine-tuning a language model on a new domain is standard practice for domain adaptation. However, it can be infeasible when it comes to modern large-scale language models such as GPT-3, which can only be accessed through APIs, making it difficult to access the internal parameters of the model. In this paper, we propose $k$NN-Adapter, a method to effectively adapt these black-box large language models (LLMs) to a new domain. The $k$NN-Adapter builds on top of the retrieval-augmented language model, and adaptively learns to interpolate the output of the language model with retrieval results from a datastore consisting of the target domain data. Our experiments on four different domains demonstrate that $k$NN-Adapter significantly improves perplexity, and works particularly well in settings with limited access to LLMs. Additionally, we show that $k$NN-Adapter is more effective than fine-tuning when the amount of training data is limited. We also release a dataset to encourage further study. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent studies on pronunciation scoring have explored the effect of introducing phone embeddings as reference pronunciation, but mostly in an implicit manner, i.e., addition or concatenation of reference phone embedding and actual pronunciation of the target phone as the phone-level pronunciation quality representation. In this paper, we propose to use linguistic-acoustic similarity to explicitly measure the deviation of non-native production from its native reference for pronunciation assessment. Specifically, the deviation is first estimated by the cosine similarity between reference phone embedding and corresponding acoustic embedding. Next, a phone-level Goodness of pronunciation (GOP) pre-training stage is introduced to guide this similarity-based learning for better initialization of the aforementioned two embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based hierarchical pronunciation scorer is used to map a sequence of phone embeddings, acoustic embeddings along with their similarity measures to predict the final utterance-level score. Experimental results on the non-native databases suggest that the proposed system significantly outperforms the baselines, where the acoustic and phone embeddings are simply added or concatenated. A further examination shows that the phone embeddings learned in the proposed approach are able to capture linguistic-acoustic attributes of native pronunciation as reference. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper studies 3D low-dose computed tomography (CT) imaging. Although various deep learning methods were developed in this context, typically they perform denoising due to low-dose and deblurring for super-resolution separately. Up to date, little work was done for simultaneous in-plane denoising and through-plane deblurring, which is important to improve clinical CT images. For this task, a straightforward method is to directly train an end-to-end 3D network. However, it demands much more training data and expensive computational costs. Here, we propose to link in-plane and through-plane transformers for simultaneous in-plane denoising and through-plane deblurring, termed as LIT-Former, which can efficiently synergize in-plane and through-plane sub-tasks for 3D CT imaging and enjoy the advantages of both convolution and transformer networks. LIT-Former has two novel designs: efficient multi-head self-attention modules (eMSM) and efficient convolutional feed-forward networks (eCFN). First, eMSM integrates in-plane 2D self-attention and through-plane 1D self-attention to efficiently capture global interactions of 3D self-attention, the core unit of transformer networks. Second, eCFN integrates 2D convolution and 1D convolution to extract local information of 3D convolution in the same fashion. As a result, the proposed LIT-Former synergizes these two sub-tasks, significantly reducing the computational complexity as compared to 3D counterparts and enabling rapid convergence. Extensive experimental results on simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving motor neuron degeneration. Significant research has begun to establish brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a potential biomarker to diagnose and monitor the state of the disease. Deep learning has turned into a prominent class of machine learning programs in computer vision and has been successfully employed to solve diverse medical image analysis tasks. However, deep learning-based methods applied to neuroimaging have not achieved superior performance in ALS patients classification from healthy controls due to having insignificant structural changes correlated with pathological features. Therefore, the critical challenge in deep models is to determine useful discriminative features with limited training data. By exploiting the long-range relationship of image features, this study introduces a framework named SF2Former that leverages vision transformer architecture's power to distinguish the ALS subjects from the control group. To further improve the network's performance, spatial and frequency domain information are combined because MRI scans are captured in the frequency domain before being converted to the spatial domain. The proposed framework is trained with a set of consecutive coronal 2D slices, which uses the pre-trained weights on ImageNet by leveraging transfer learning. Finally, a majority voting scheme has been employed to those coronal slices of a particular subject to produce the final classification decision. Our proposed architecture has been thoroughly assessed with multi-modal neuroimaging data using two well-organized versions of the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC) multi-center datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategy in terms of classification accuracy compared with several popular deep learning-based techniques. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
