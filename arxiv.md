### [Towards Next Generation of Pedestrian and Connected Vehicle In-the-loop  Research: A Digital Twin Simulation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05090)
Digital Twin is an emerging technology that replicates real-world entities into a digital space. It has attracted increasing attention in the transportation field and many researchers are exploring its future applications in the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies. Connected vehicles (CVs) and pedestrians are among the major traffic participants in ITS. However, the usage of Digital Twin in research involving both CV and pedestrian remains largely unexplored. In this study, a Digital Twin framework for CV and pedestrian in-the-loop simulation is proposed. The proposed framework consists of the physical world, the digital world, and data transmission in between. The features for the entities (CV and pedestrian) that need digital twined are divided into external state and internal state, and the attributes in each state are described. We also demonstrate a sample architecture under the proposed Digital Twin framework, which is based on Carla-Sumo Co-simulation and Cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). The proposed framework is expected to provide guidance to the future Digital Twin research, and the architecture we build can serve as the testbed for further research and development of ITS applications on CV and pedestrian. 

### [All-in-One: A Highly Representative DNN Pruning Framework for Edge  Devices with Dynamic Power Management](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05122)
During the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices, many research efforts are devoted to the limited hardware resource. However, little attention is paid to the influence of dynamic power management. As edge devices typically only have a budget of energy with batteries (rather than almost unlimited energy support on servers or workstations), their dynamic power management often changes the execution frequency as in the widely-used dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique. This leads to highly unstable inference speed performance, especially for computation-intensive DNN models, which can harm user experience and waste hardware resources. We firstly identify this problem and then propose All-in-One, a highly representative pruning framework to work with dynamic power management using DVFS. The framework can use only one set of model weights and soft masks (together with other auxiliary parameters of negligible storage) to represent multiple models of various pruning ratios. By re-configuring the model to the corresponding pruning ratio for a specific execution frequency (and voltage), we are able to achieve stable inference speed, i.e., keeping the difference in speed performance under various execution frequencies as small as possible. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves high accuracy for multiple models of different pruning ratios, but also reduces their variance of inference latency for various frequencies, with minimal memory consumption of only one model and one soft mask. 

### [SMILE: Scaling Mixture-of-Experts with Efficient Bi-level Routing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05191)
The mixture of Expert (MoE) parallelism is a recent advancement that scales up the model size with constant computational cost. MoE selects different sets of parameters (i.e., experts) for each incoming token, resulting in a sparsely-activated model. Despite several successful applications of MoE, its training efficiency degrades significantly as the number of experts increases. The routing stage in MoE relies on the efficiency of the All2All communication collective, which suffers from network congestion and has poor scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SMILE, which exploits heterogeneous network bandwidth and splits a single-step routing into bi-level routing. Our experimental results show that the proposed method obtains a 2.5x speedup over Switch Transformer in terms of pretraining throughput on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus without losing any convergence speed. 

### [MAGVIT: Masked Generative Video Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05199)
We introduce the MAsked Generative VIdeo Transformer, MAGVIT, to tackle various video synthesis tasks with a single model. We introduce a 3D tokenizer to quantize a video into spatial-temporal visual tokens and propose an embedding method for masked video token modeling to facilitate multi-task learning. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality, efficiency, and flexibility of MAGVIT. Our experiments show that (i) MAGVIT performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches and establishes the best-published FVD on three video generation benchmarks, including the challenging Kinetics-600. (ii) MAGVIT outperforms existing methods in inference time by two orders of magnitude against diffusion models and by 60x against autoregressive models. (iii) A single MAGVIT model supports ten diverse generation tasks and generalizes across videos from different visual domains. The source code and trained models will be released to the public at https://magvit.cs.cmu.edu. 

### [Neural Controller Synthesis for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications  Using Encoder-Decoder Structured Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05200)
In this paper, we propose a control synthesis method for signal temporal logic (STL) specifications with neural networks (NNs). Most of the previous works consider training a controller for only a given STL specification. These approaches, however, require retraining the NN controller if a new specification arises and needs to be satisfied, which results in large consumption of memory and inefficient training. To tackle this problem, we propose to construct NN controllers by introducing encoder-decoder structured NNs with an attention mechanism. The encoder takes an STL formula as input and encodes it into an appropriate vector, and the decoder outputs control signals that will meet the given specification. As the encoder, we consider three NN structures: sequential, tree-structured, and graph-structured NNs. All the model parameters are trained in an end-to-end manner to maximize the expected robustness that is known to be a quantitative semantics of STL formulae. We compare the control performances attained by the above NN structures through a numerical experiment of the path planning problem, showing the efficacy of the proposed approach. 

### [Machine intuition: Uncovering human-like intuitive decision-making in  GPT-3.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05206)
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies revolutionize vast fields of society. Humans using these systems are likely to expect them to work in a potentially hyperrational manner. However, in this study, we show that some AI systems, namely large language models (LLMs), exhibit behavior that strikingly resembles human-like intuition - and the many cognitive errors that come with them. We use a state-of-the-art LLM, namely the latest iteration of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3.5), and probe it with the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) as well as semantic illusions that were originally designed to investigate intuitive decision-making in humans. Our results show that GPT-3.5 systematically exhibits "machine intuition," meaning that it produces incorrect responses that are surprisingly equal to how humans respond to the CRT as well as to semantic illusions. We investigate several approaches to test how sturdy GPT-3.5's inclination for intuitive-like decision-making is. Our study demonstrates that investigating LLMs with methods from cognitive science has the potential to reveal emergent traits and adjust expectations regarding their machine behavior. 

### [Information-Preserved Blending Method for Forward-Looking Sonar  Mosaicing in Non-Ideal System Configuration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05216)
Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) has started to gain attention in the field of near-bottom close-range underwater inspection because of its high resolution and high framerate features. Although Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms have been applied tentatively for object-searching tasks, human supervision is still indispensable, especially when involving critical areas. A clear FLS mosaic containing all suspicious information is in demand to help experts deal with tremendous perception data. However, previous work only considered that FLS is working in an ideal system configuration, which assumes an appropriate sonar imaging setup and the availability of accurate positioning data. Without those promises, the intra-frame and inter-frame artifacts will appear and degrade the quality of the final mosaic by making the information of interest invisible. In this paper, we propose a novel blending method for FLS mosaicing which can preserve interested information. A Long-Short Time Sliding Window (LST-SW) is designed to rectify the local statistics of raw sonar images. The statistics are then utilized to construct a Global Variance Map (GVM). The GVM helps to emphasize the useful information contained in images in the blending phase by classifying the informative and featureless pixels, thereby enhancing the quality of final mosaic. The method is verified using data collected in the real environment. The results show that our method can preserve more details in FLS mosaics for human inspection purposes in practice. 

### [Progressive Multi-view Human Mesh Recovery with Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05223)
To date, little attention has been given to multi-view 3D human mesh estimation, despite real-life applicability (e.g., motion capture, sport analysis) and robustness to single-view ambiguities. Existing solutions typically suffer from poor generalization performance to new settings, largely due to the limited diversity of image-mesh pairs in multi-view training data. To address this shortcoming, people have explored the use of synthetic images. But besides the usual impact of visual gap between rendered and target data, synthetic-data-driven multi-view estimators also suffer from overfitting to the camera viewpoint distribution sampled during training which usually differs from real-world distributions. Tackling both challenges, we propose a novel simulation-based training pipeline for multi-view human mesh recovery, which (a) relies on intermediate 2D representations which are more robust to synthetic-to-real domain gap; (b) leverages learnable calibration and triangulation to adapt to more diversified camera setups; and (c) progressively aggregates multi-view information in a canonical 3D space to remove ambiguities in 2D representations. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution especially for unseen in-the-wild scenarios. 

### [Graph-Regularized Manifold-Aware Conditional Wasserstein GAN for Brain  Functional Connectivity Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05316)
Common measures of brain functional connectivity (FC) including covariance and correlation matrices are semi-positive definite (SPD) matrices residing on a cone-shape Riemannian manifold. Despite its remarkable success for Euclidean-valued data generation, use of standard generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate manifold-valued FC data neglects its inherent SPD structure and hence the inter-relatedness of edges in real FC. We propose a novel graph-regularized manifold-aware conditional Wasserstein GAN (GR-SPD-GAN) for FC data generation on the SPD manifold that can preserve the global FC structure. Specifically, we optimize a generalized Wasserstein distance between the real and generated SPD data under an adversarial training, conditioned on the class labels. The resulting generator can synthesize new SPD-valued FC matrices associated with different classes of brain networks, e.g., brain disorder or healthy control. Furthermore, we introduce additional population graph-based regularization terms on both the SPD manifold and its tangent space to encourage the generator to respect the inter-subject similarity of FC patterns in the real data. This also helps in avoiding mode collapse and produces more stable GAN training. Evaluated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of major depressive disorder (MDD), qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed GR-SPD-GAN clearly outperforms several state-of-the-art GANs in generating more realistic fMRI-based FC samples. When applied to FC data augmentation for MDD identification, classification models trained on augmented data generated by our approach achieved the largest margin of improvement in classification accuracy among the competing GANs over baselines without data augmentation. 

### [Topic-Aware Response Generation in Task-Oriented Dialogue with  Unstructured Knowledge Access](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05373)
To alleviate the problem of structured databases' limited coverage, recent task-oriented dialogue systems incorporate external unstructured knowledge to guide the generation of system responses. However, these usually use word or sentence level similarities to detect the relevant knowledge context, which only partially capture the topical level relevance. In this paper, we examine how to better integrate topical information in knowledge grounded task-oriented dialogue and propose ``Topic-Aware Response Generation'' (TARG), an end-to-end response generation model. TARG incorporates multiple topic-aware attention mechanisms to derive the importance weighting scheme over dialogue utterances and external knowledge sources towards a better understanding of the dialogue history. Experimental results indicate that TARG achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge selection and response generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 3.2, 3.6, and 4.2 points in EM, F1 and BLEU-4 respectively on Doc2Dial, and performing comparably with previous work on DSTC9; both being knowledge-grounded task-oriented dialogue datasets. 

### [How to Backdoor Diffusion Models?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05400)
Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning empowered generative models that are trained based on the principle of learning forward and reverse diffusion processes via progressive noise-addition and denoising. To gain a better understanding of the limitations and potential risks, this paper presents the first study on the robustness of diffusion models against backdoor attacks. Specifically, we propose BadDiffusion, a novel attack framework that engineers compromised diffusion processes during model training for backdoor implantation. At the inference stage, the backdoored diffusion model will behave just like an untampered generator for regular data inputs, while falsely generating some targeted outcome designed by the bad actor upon receiving the implanted trigger signal. Such a critical risk can be dreadful for downstream tasks and applications built upon the problematic model. Our extensive experiments on various backdoor attack settings show that BadDiffusion can consistently lead to compromised diffusion models with high utility and target specificity. Even worse, BadDiffusion can be made cost-effective by simply finetuning a clean pre-trained diffusion model to implant backdoors. We also explore some possible countermeasures for risk mitigation. Our results call attention to potential risks and possible misuse of diffusion models. 

### [DiffAlign : Few-shot learning using diffusion based synthesis and  alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05404)
We address the problem of few-shot classification where the goal is to learn a classifier from a limited set of samples. While data-driven learning is shown to be effective in various applications, learning from less data still remains challenging. To address this challenge, existing approaches consider various data augmentation techniques for increasing the number of training samples. Pseudo-labeling is commonly used in a few-shot setup, where approximate labels are estimated for a large set of unlabeled images. We propose DiffAlign which focuses on generating images from class labels. Specifically, we leverage the recent success of the generative models (e.g., DALL-E and diffusion models) that can generate realistic images from texts. However, naive learning on synthetic images is not adequate due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Thus, we employ a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the synthetic images to the real images minimizing the domain gap. We evaluate our method on the standard few-shot classification benchmarks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and a cross-domain few-shot classification benchmark: miniImageNet to CUB. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art in both 5-shot and 1-shot setups on these benchmarks. Our approach is also shown to be effective in the zero-shot classification setup 

### [Ego Vehicle Speed Estimation using 3D Convolution with Masked Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05432)
Speed estimation of an ego vehicle is crucial to enable autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance technologies. Due to functional and legacy issues, conventional methods depend on in-car sensors to extract vehicle speed through the Controller Area Network bus. However, it is desirable to have modular systems that are not susceptible to external sensors to execute perception tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D-CNN with masked-attention architecture to estimate ego vehicle speed using a single front-facing monocular camera. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on two publicly available datasets, nuImages and KITTI. We also demonstrate the efficacy of masked-attention by comparing our method with a traditional 3D-CNN. 

### [Understanding Concurrency Vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05438)
While there is a large body of work on analyzing concurrency related software bugs and developing techniques for detecting and patching them, little attention has been given to concurrency related security vulnerabilities. The two are different in that not all bugs are vulnerabilities: for a bug to be exploitable, there needs be a way for attackers to trigger its execution and cause damage, e.g., by revealing sensitive data or running malicious code. To fill the gap, we conduct the first empirical study of concurrency vulnerabilities reported in the Linux operating system in the past ten years. We focus on analyzing the confirmed vulnerabilities archived in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, which are then categorized into different groups based on bug types, exploit patterns, and patch strategies adopted by developers. We use code snippets to illustrate individual vulnerability types and patch strategies. We also use statistics to illustrate the entire landscape, including the percentage of each vulnerability type. We hope to shed some light on the problem, e.g., concurrency vulnerabilities continue to pose a serious threat to system security, and it is difficult even for kernel developers to analyze and patch them. Therefore, more efforts are needed to develop tools and techniques for analyzing and patching these vulnerabilities. 

### [Vision Transformer with Attentive Pooling for Robust Facial Expression  Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05463)
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is an extremely challenging task. Recently, some Vision Transformers (ViT) have been explored for FER, but most of them perform inferiorly compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This is mainly because the new proposed modules are difficult to converge well from scratch due to lacking inductive bias and easy to focus on the occlusion and noisy areas. TransFER, a representative transformer-based method for FER, alleviates this with multi-branch attention dropping but brings excessive computations. On the contrary, we present two attentive pooling (AP) modules to pool noisy features directly. The AP modules include Attentive Patch Pooling (APP) and Attentive Token Pooling (ATP). They aim to guide the model to emphasize the most discriminative features while reducing the impacts of less relevant features. The proposed APP is employed to select the most informative patches on CNN features, and ATP discards unimportant tokens in ViT. Being simple to implement and without learnable parameters, the APP and ATP intuitively reduce the computational cost while boosting the performance by ONLY pursuing the most discriminative features. Qualitative results demonstrate the motivations and effectiveness of our attentive poolings. Besides, quantitative results on six in-the-wild datasets outperform other state-of-the-art methods. 

### [A new approach to handle curved meshes in the Hybrid High-Order method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05474)
The hybrid high-order method is a modern numerical framework for the approximation of elliptic PDEs. We present here an extension of the hybrid high-order method to meshes possessing curved edges/faces. Such an extension allows us to enforce boundary conditions exactly on curved domains, and capture curved geometries that appear internally in the domain e.g. discontinuities in a diffusion coefficient. The method makes use of non-polynomial functions on the curved faces and does not require any mappings between reference elements/faces. Such an approach does not require the faces to be polynomial, and has a strict upper bound on the number of degrees of freedom on a curved face for a given polynomial degree. Moreover, this approach of enriching the space of unknowns on the curved faces with non-polynomial functions should extend naturally to other polytopal methods. We show the method to be stable and consistent on curved meshes and derive optimal error estimates in L2 and energy norms. We present numerical examples of the method on a domain with curved boundary, and for a diffusion problem such that the diffusion tensor is discontinuous along a curved arc. 

### [Focal-PETR: Embracing Foreground for Efficient Multi-Camera 3D Object  Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05505)
The dominant multi-camera 3D detection paradigm is based on explicit 3D feature construction, which requires complicated indexing of local image-view features via 3D-to-2D projection. Other methods implicitly introduce geometric positional encoding and perform global attention (e.g., PETR) to build the relationship between image tokens and 3D objects. The 3D-to-2D perspective inconsistency and global attention lead to a weak correlation between foreground tokens and queries, resulting in slow convergence. We propose Focal-PETR with instance-guided supervision and spatial alignment module to adaptively focus object queries on discriminative foreground regions. Focal-PETR additionally introduces a down-sampling strategy to reduce the consumption of global attention. Due to the highly parallelized implementation and down-sampling strategy, our model, without depth supervision, achieves leading performance on the large-scale nuScenes benchmark and a superior speed of 30 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms PETR while consuming 3x fewer training hours. The code will be made publicly available. 

### [A model-data asymptotic-preserving neural network method based on  micro-macro decomposition for gray radiative transfer equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05523)
We propose a model-data asymptotic-preserving neural network(MD-APNN) method to solve the nonlinear gray radiative transfer equations(GRTEs). The system is challenging to be simulated with both the traditional numerical schemes and the vanilla physics-informed neural networks(PINNs) due to the multiscale characteristics. Under the framework of PINNs, we employ a micro-macro decomposition technique to construct a new asymptotic-preserving(AP) loss function, which includes the residual of the governing equations in the micro-macro coupled form, the initial and boundary conditions with additional diffusion limit information, the conservation laws, and a few labeled data. A convergence analysis is performed for the proposed method, and a number of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of MD-APNNs, and particularly, the importance of the AP property in the neural networks for the diffusion dominating problems. The numerical results indicate that MD-APNNs lead to a better performance than APNNs or pure data-driven networks in the simulation of the nonlinear non-stationary GRTEs. 

### [Graph Learning for Anomaly Analytics: Algorithms, Applications, and  Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05532)
Anomaly analytics is a popular and vital task in various research contexts, which has been studied for several decades. At the same time, deep learning has shown its capacity in solving many graph-based tasks like, node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Recently, many studies are extending graph learning models for solving anomaly analytics problems, resulting in beneficial advances in graph-based anomaly analytics techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph learning methods for anomaly analytics tasks. We classify them into four categories based on their model architectures, namely graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph autoencoder (GAE), and other graph learning models. The differences between these methods are also compared in a systematic manner. Furthermore, we outline several graph-based anomaly analytics applications across various domains in the real world. Finally, we discuss five potential future research directions in this rapidly growing field. 

### [PromptCAL: Contrastive Affinity Learning via Auxiliary Prompts for  Generalized Novel Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05590)
Although existing semi-supervised learning models achieve remarkable success in learning with unannotated in-distribution data, they mostly fail to learn on unlabeled data sampled from novel semantic classes due to their closed-set assumption. In this work, we target a pragmatic but under-explored Generalized Novel Category Discovery (GNCD) setting. The GNCD setting aims to categorize unlabeled training data coming from known and novel classes by leveraging the information of partially labeled known classes. We propose a two-stage Contrastive Affinity Learning method with auxiliary visual Prompts, dubbed PromptCAL, to address this challenging problem. Our approach discovers reliable pairwise sample affinities to learn better semantic clustering of both known and novel classes for the class token and visual prompts. First, we propose a discriminative prompt regularization loss to reinforce semantic discriminativeness of prompt-adapted pre-trained vision transformer for refined affinity relationships. Besides, we propose a contrastive affinity learning stage to calibrate semantic representations based on our iterative semi-supervised affinity graph generation method for semantically-enhanced prompt supervision. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our PromptCAL method is more effective in discovering novel classes even with limited annotations and surpasses the current state-of-the-art on generic and fine-grained benchmarks (with nearly $11\%$ gain on CUB-200, and $9\%$ on ImageNet-100) on overall accuracy. 

### [Transductive Linear Probing: A Novel Framework for Few-Shot Node  Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05606)
Few-shot node classification is tasked to provide accurate predictions for nodes from novel classes with only few representative labeled nodes. This problem has drawn tremendous attention for its projection to prevailing real-world applications, such as product categorization for newly added commodity categories on an E-commerce platform with scarce records or diagnoses for rare diseases on a patient similarity graph. To tackle such challenging label scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph domain, meta-learning has become a successful and predominant paradigm. More recently, inspired by the development of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained node embeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative to meta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate the potential of an alternative framework, \textit{Transductive Linear Probing}, that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from graph contrastive learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot node classification from standard fully supervised to a more realistic self-supervised setting, where meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed due to the shortage of supervision from training classes. Surprisingly, even without any ground-truth labels, transductive linear probing with self-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform the state-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same protocol. We hope this work can shed new light on few-shot node classification problems and foster future research on learning from scarcely labeled instances on graphs. 

### [Cross-Modal Learning with 3D Deformable Attention for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05638)
An important challenge in vision-based action recognition is the embedding of spatiotemporal features with two or more heterogeneous modalities into a single feature. In this study, we propose a new 3D deformable transformer for action recognition with adaptive spatiotemporal receptive fields and a cross-modal learning scheme. The 3D deformable transformer consists of three attention modules: 3D deformability, local joint stride, and temporal stride attention. The two cross-modal tokens are input into the 3D deformable attention module to create a cross-attention token with a reflected spatiotemporal correlation. Local joint stride attention is applied to spatially combine attention and pose tokens. Temporal stride attention temporally reduces the number of input tokens in the attention module and supports temporal expression learning without the simultaneous use of all tokens. The deformable transformer iterates L times and combines the last cross-modal token for classification. The proposed 3D deformable transformer was tested on the NTU60, NTU120, FineGYM, and Penn Action datasets, and showed results better than or similar to pre-trained state-of-the-art methods even without a pre-training process. In addition, by visualizing important joints and correlations during action recognition through spatial joint and temporal stride attention, the possibility of achieving an explainable potential for action recognition is presented. 

### [Masked autoencoders is an effective solution to transformer data-hungry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05677)
Vision Transformers (ViTs) outperforms convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in several vision tasks with its global modeling capabilities. However, ViT lacks the inductive bias inherent to convolution making it require a large amount of data for training. This results in ViT not performing as well as CNNs on small datasets like medicine and science. We experimentally found that masked autoencoders (MAE) can make the transformer focus more on the image itself, thus alleviating the data-hungry issue of ViT to some extent. Yet the current MAE model is too complex resulting in over-fitting problems on small datasets. This leads to a gap between MAEs trained on small datasets and advanced CNNs models still. Therefore, we investigated how to reduce the decoder complexity in MAE and found a more suitable architectural configuration for it with small datasets. Besides, we additionally designed a location prediction task and a contrastive learning task to introduce localization and invariance characteristics for MAE. Our contrastive learning task not only enables the model to learn high-level visual information but also allows the training of MAE's class token. This is something that most MAE improvement efforts do not consider. Extensive experiments have shown that our method shows state-of-the-art performance on standard small datasets as well as medical datasets with few samples compared to the current popular masked image modeling (MIM) and vision transformers for small datasets.The code and models are available at https://github.com/Talented-Q/SDMAE. 

### [Evolutionary Multitasking with Solution Space Cutting for Point Cloud  Registration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05679)
Point cloud registration (PCR) is a popular research topic in computer vision. Recently, the registration method in an evolutionary way has received continuous attention because of its robustness to the initial pose and flexibility in objective function design. However, most evolving registration methods cannot tackle the local optimum well and they have rarely investigated the success ratio, which implies the probability of not falling into local optima and is closely related to the practicality of the algorithm. Evolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO) is a widely used paradigm, which can boost exploration capability through knowledge transfer among related tasks. Inspired by this concept, this study proposes a novel evolving registration algorithm via EMTO, where the multi-task configuration is based on the idea of solution space cutting. Concretely, one task searching in cut space assists another task with complex function landscape in escaping from local optima and enhancing successful registration ratio. To reduce unnecessary computational cost, a sparse-to-dense strategy is proposed. In addition, a novel fitness function robust to various overlap rates as well as a problem-specific metric of computational cost is introduced. Compared with 7 evolving registration approaches and 4 traditional registration approaches on the object-scale and scene-scale registration datasets, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performances in terms of precision and tackling local optima. 

### [Human Mobility Modeling During the COVID-19 Pandemic via Deep Graph  Diffusion Infomax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05707)
Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), such as social gathering restrictions, have shown effectiveness to slow the transmission of COVID-19 by reducing the contact of people. To support policy-makers, multiple studies have first modeled human mobility via macro indicators (e.g., average daily travel distance) and then studied the effectiveness of NPIs. In this work, we focus on mobility modeling and, from a micro perspective, aim to predict locations that will be visited by COVID-19 cases. Since NPIs generally cause economic and societal loss, such a micro perspective prediction benefits governments when they design and evaluate them. However, in real-world situations, strict privacy data protection regulations result in severe data sparsity problems (i.e., limited case and location information). To address these challenges, we formulate the micro perspective mobility modeling into computing the relevance score between a diffusion and a location, conditional on a geometric graph. we propose a model named Deep Graph Diffusion Infomax (DGDI), which jointly models variables including a geometric graph, a set of diffusions and a set of locations.To facilitate the research of COVID-19 prediction, we present two benchmarks that contain geometric graphs and location histories of COVID-19 cases. Extensive experiments on the two benchmarks show that DGDI significantly outperforms other competing methods. 

### [Tensor-based Sequential Learning via Hankel Matrix Representation for  Next Item Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05720)
Self-attentive transformer models have recently been shown to solve the next item recommendation task very efficiently. The learned attention weights capture sequential dynamics in user behavior and generalize well. Motivated by the special structure of learned parameter space, we question if it is possible to mimic it with an alternative and more lightweight approach. We develop a new tensor factorization-based model that ingrains the structural knowledge about sequential data within the learning process. We demonstrate how certain properties of a self-attention network can be reproduced with our approach based on special Hankel matrix representation. The resulting model has a shallow linear architecture and compares competitively to its neural counterpart. 

### [ROIFormer: Semantic-Aware Region of Interest Transformer for Efficient  Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05729)
The exploration of mutual-benefit cross-domains has shown great potential toward accurate self-supervised depth estimation. In this work, we revisit feature fusion between depth and semantic information and propose an efficient local adaptive attention method for geometric aware representation enhancement. Instead of building global connections or deforming attention across the feature space without restraint, we bound the spatial interaction within a learnable region of interest. In particular, we leverage geometric cues from semantic information to learn local adaptive bounding boxes to guide unsupervised feature aggregation. The local areas preclude most irrelevant reference points from attention space, yielding more selective feature learning and faster convergence. We naturally extend the paradigm into a multi-head and hierarchic way to enable the information distillation in different semantic levels and improve the feature discriminative ability for fine-grained depth estimation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our proposed method establishes a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised monocular depth estimation task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach over former Transformer variants. 

### [Satellite-based ITS Data Offloading & Computation in 6G Networks: A  Cooperative Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization DRL with Attention  Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05757)
With the rapid growth of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), there is a growing need to support real-time network applications. However, terrestrial networks are insufficient to support diverse applications for remote airplanes ships, and trains. Meanwhile, satellite networks can be a great supplement to terrestrial networks regarding coverage, flexibility, and availability. Thus, we investigate a novel ITS data offloading and computations services based on satellite networks, in which low-Earth orbit (LEO) and cube satellites are regarded as independent mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, responsible for scheduling the processing of ITS data generated by ITS nodes. We formulate a joint delay and rental price minimization problem for different satellite servers while optimizing offloading task selection, computing, and bandwidth resource allocation, which is mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and NP-hard. To deal with the problem's complexity, we divide the problem into two stages. Firstly, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent proximal policy optimization (Co-MAPPO) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with an attention approach for determining intelligent offloading decisions with quick convergence. Secondly, we break down the remaining subproblem into independent subproblems and find their optimal closed-form solutions. Extensive simulations are utilized to validate the proposed approach's effectiveness in comparison to baselines by 8.92% and 3.14% respectively. 

### [Multi-Dimensional Self Attention based Approach for Remaining Useful  Life Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05772)
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation plays a critical role in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Traditional machine health maintenance systems are often costly, requiring sufficient prior expertise, and are difficult to fit into highly complex and changing industrial scenarios. With the widespread deployment of sensors on industrial equipment, building the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to interconnect these devices has become an inexorable trend in the development of the digital factory. Using the device's real-time operational data collected by IIoT to get the estimated RUL through the RUL prediction algorithm, the PHM system can develop proactive maintenance measures for the device, thus, reducing maintenance costs and decreasing failure times during operation. This paper carries out research into the remaining useful life prediction model for multi-sensor devices in the IIoT scenario. We investigated the mainstream RUL prediction models and summarized the basic steps of RUL prediction modeling in this scenario. On this basis, a data-driven approach for RUL estimation is proposed in this paper. It employs a Multi-Head Attention Mechanism to fuse the multi-dimensional time-series data output from multiple sensors, in which the attention on features is used to capture the interactions between features and attention on sequences is used to learn the weights of time steps. Then, the Long Short-Term Memory Network is applied to learn the features of time series. We evaluate the proposed model on two benchmark datasets (C-MAPSS and PHM08), and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-art models. Moreover, through the interpretability of the multi-head attention mechanism, the proposed model can provide a preliminary explanation of engine degradation. Therefore, this approach is promising for predictive maintenance in IIoT scenarios. 

### [Design and Evaluation of Crowd-sourcing Platforms Based on Users  Confidence Judgments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05777)
Crowd-sourcing deals with solving problems by assigning them to a large number of non-experts called crowd using their spare time. In these systems, the final answer to the question is determined by summing up the votes obtained from the community. The popularity of using these systems has increased by facilitation of access to community members through mobile phones and the Internet. One of the issues raised in crowd-sourcing is how to choose people and how to collect answers. Usually, the separation of users is done based on their performance in a pre-test. Designing the pre-test for performance calculation is challenging; The pre-test questions should be chosen in a way that they test the characteristics in people related to the main questions. One of the ways to increase the accuracy of crowd-sourcing systems is to pay attention to people's cognitive characteristics and decision-making model to form a crowd and improve the estimation of the accuracy of their answers to questions. People can estimate the correctness of their responses while making a decision. The accuracy of this estimate is determined by a quantity called metacognition ability. Metacoginition is referred to the case where the confidence level is considered along with the answer to increase the accuracy of the solution. In this paper, by both mathematical and experimental analysis, we would answer the following question: Is it possible to improve the performance of the crowd-sourcing system by knowing the metacognition of individuals and recording and using the users' confidence in their answers? 

### [GT-CausIn: a novel causal-based insight for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05782)
Traffic forecasting is an important application of spatiotemporal series prediction. Among different methods, graph neural networks have achieved so far the most promising results, learning relations between graph nodes then becomes a crucial task. However, improvement space is very limited when these relations are learned in a node-to-node manner. The challenge stems from (1) obscure temporal dependencies between different stations, (2) difficulties in defining variables beyond the node level, and (3) no ready-made method to validate the learned relations. To confront these challenges, we define legitimate traffic causal variables to discover the causal relation inside the traffic network, which is carefully checked with statistic tools and case analysis. We then present a novel model named Graph Spatial-Temporal Network Based on Causal Insight (GT-CausIn), where prior learned causal information is integrated with graph diffusion layers and temporal convolutional network (TCN) layers. Experiments are carried out on two real-world traffic datasets: PEMS-BAY and METR-LA, which show that GT-CausIn significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on mid-term and long-term prediction. 

### [P-Transformer: Towards Better Document-to-Document Neural Machine  Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05830)
Directly training a document-to-document (Doc2Doc) neural machine translation (NMT) via Transformer from scratch, especially on small datasets usually fails to converge. Our dedicated probing tasks show that 1) both the absolute position and relative position information gets gradually weakened or even vanished once it reaches the upper encoder layers, and 2) the vanishing of absolute position information in encoder output causes the training failure of Doc2Doc NMT. To alleviate this problem, we propose a position-aware Transformer (P-Transformer) to enhance both the absolute and relative position information in both self-attention and cross-attention. Specifically, we integrate absolute positional information, i.e., position embeddings, into the query-key pairs both in self-attention and cross-attention through a simple yet effective addition operation. Moreover, we also integrate relative position encoding in self-attention. The proposed P-Transformer utilizes sinusoidal position encoding and does not require any task-specified position embedding, segment embedding, or attention mechanism. Through the above methods, we build a Doc2Doc NMT model with P-Transformer, which ingests the source document and completely generates the target document in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) way. In addition, P-Transformer can be applied to seq2seq-based document-to-sentence (Doc2Sent) and sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) translation. Extensive experimental results of Doc2Doc NMT show that P-Transformer significantly outperforms strong baselines on widely-used 9 document-level datasets in 7 language pairs, covering small-, middle-, and large-scales, and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Experimentation on discourse phenomena shows that our Doc2Doc NMT models improve the translation quality in both BLEU and discourse coherence. We make our code available on Github. 

### [BeautyREC: Robust, Efficient, and Content-preserving Makeup Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05855)
In this work, we propose a Robust, Efficient, and Component-specific makeup transfer method (abbreviated as BeautyREC). A unique departure from prior methods that leverage global attention, simply concatenate features, or implicitly manipulate features in latent space, we propose a component-specific correspondence to directly transfer the makeup style of a reference image to the corresponding components (e.g., skin, lips, eyes) of a source image, making elaborate and accurate local makeup transfer. As an auxiliary, the long-range visual dependencies of Transformer are introduced for effective global makeup transfer. Instead of the commonly used cycle structure that is complex and unstable, we employ a content consistency loss coupled with a content encoder to implement efficient single-path makeup transfer. The key insights of this study are modeling component-specific correspondence for local makeup transfer, capturing long-range dependencies for global makeup transfer, and enabling efficient makeup transfer via a single-path structure. We also contribute BeautyFace, a makeup transfer dataset to supplement existing datasets. This dataset contains 3,000 faces, covering more diverse makeup styles, face poses, and races. Each face has annotated parsing map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our method is appealing as it is with only 1M parameters, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods (BeautyGAN: 8.43M, PSGAN: 12.62M, SCGAN: 15.30M, CPM: 9.24M, SSAT: 10.48M). 

### ["I think this is the most disruptive technology": Exploring Sentiments  of ChatGPT Early Adopters using Twitter Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05856)
Large language models have recently attracted significant attention due to their impressive performance on a variety of tasks. ChatGPT developed by OpenAI is one such implementation of a large, pre-trained language model that has gained immense popularity among early adopters, where certain users go to the extent of characterizing it as a disruptive technology in many domains. Understanding such early adopters' sentiments is important because it can provide insights into the potential success or failure of the technology, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-method study using 10,732 tweets from early ChatGPT users. We first use topic modelling to identify the main topics and then perform an in-depth qualitative sentiment analysis of each topic. Our results show that the majority of the early adopters have expressed overwhelmingly positive sentiments related to topics such as Disruptions to software development, Entertainment and exercising creativity. Only a limited percentage of users expressed concerns about issues such as the potential for misuse of ChatGPT, especially regarding topics such as Impact on educational aspects. We discuss these findings by providing specific examples for each topic and then detail implications related to addressing these concerns for both researchers and users. 

### [Automated ICD Coding using Extreme Multi-label Long Text  Transformer-based Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05857)
Background: Encouraged by the success of pretrained Transformer models in many natural language processing tasks, their use for International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding tasks is now actively being explored. In this study, we investigate three types of Transformer-based models, aiming to address the extreme label set and long text classification challenges that are posed by automated ICD coding tasks. Methods: The Transformer-based model PLM-ICD achieved the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ICD coding benchmark dataset MIMIC-III. It was chosen as our baseline model to be further optimised. XR-Transformer, the new SOTA model in the general extreme multi-label text classification domain, and XR-LAT, a novel adaptation of the XR-Transformer model, were also trained on the MIMIC-III dataset. XR-LAT is a recursively trained model chain on a predefined hierarchical code tree with label-wise attention, knowledge transferring and dynamic negative sampling mechanisms. Results: Our optimised PLM-ICD model, which was trained with longer total and chunk sequence lengths, significantly outperformed the current SOTA PLM-ICD model, and achieved the highest micro-F1 score of 60.8%. The XR-Transformer model, although SOTA in the general domain, did not perform well across all metrics. The best XR-LAT based model obtained results that were competitive with the current SOTA PLM-ICD model, including improving the macro-AUC by 2.1%. Conclusion: Our optimised PLM-ICD model is the new SOTA model for automated ICD coding on the MIMIC-III dataset, while our novel XR-LAT model performs competitively with the previous SOTA PLM-ICD model. 

### [Diff-Font: Diffusion Model for Robust One-Shot Font Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05895)
Font generation is a difficult and time-consuming task, especially in those languages using ideograms that have complicated structures with a large number of characters, such as Chinese. To solve this problem, few-shot font generation and even one-shot font generation have attracted a lot of attention. However, most existing font generation methods may still suffer from (i) large cross-font gap challenge; (ii) subtle cross-font variation problem; and (iii) incorrect generation of complicated characters. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot font generation method based on a diffusion model, named Diff-Font, which can be stably trained on large datasets. The proposed model aims to generate the entire font library by giving only one sample as the reference. Specifically, a large stroke-wise dataset is constructed, and a stroke-wise diffusion model is proposed to preserve the structure and the completion of each generated character. To our best knowledge, the proposed Diff-Font is the first work that developed diffusion models to handle the font generation task. The well-trained Diff-Font is not only robust to font gap and font variation, but also achieved promising performance on difficult character generation. Compared to previous font generation methods, our model reaches state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

### [Hierarchical multimodal transformers for Multi-Page DocVQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05935)
Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) refers to the task of answering questions from document images. Existing work on DocVQA only considers single-page documents. However, in real scenarios documents are mostly composed of multiple pages that should be processed altogether. In this work we extend DocVQA to the multi-page scenario. For that, we first create a new dataset, MP-DocVQA, where questions are posed over multi-page documents instead of single pages. Second, we propose a new hierarchical method, Hi-VT5, based on the T5 architecture, that overcomes the limitations of current methods to process long multi-page documents. The proposed method is based on a hierarchical transformer architecture where the encoder summarizes the most relevant information of every page and then, the decoder takes this summarized information to generate the final answer. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method is able, in a single stage, to answer the questions and provide the page that contains the relevant information to find the answer, which can be used as a kind of explainability measure. 

### [A Survey and Comparison of Industrial and Academic Research on the  Evolution of Software Product Lines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05953)
Past research on software product lines has focused on the initial development of reusable assets and related challenges, such as cost estimation and implementation issues. Naturally, as software product lines are increasingly adopted throughout industry, their ongoing maintenance and evolution are getting more attention as well. However, it is not clear to what degree research is following this trend, and where the interests and demands of the industry lie. In this technical report, we provide a survey and comparison of selected publications on software product line maintenance and evolution at SPLC. In particular, we analyze and discuss similarities and differences of these papers with regard to their affiliation with industry and academia. From this, we infer directions for future research that pave the way for systematic and organized evolution of software product lines, from which industry may benefit as well. 

### [Towards Practical Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05973)
Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in image generation. Their guidance formulation allows an external model to plug-and-play control the generation process for various tasks without fine-tuning the diffusion model. However, the direct use of publicly available off-the-shelf models for guidance fails due to their poor performance on noisy inputs. For that, the existing practice is to fine-tune the guidance models with labeled data corrupted with noises. In this paper, we argue that this practice has limitations in two aspects: (1) performing on inputs with extremely various noises is too hard for a single model; (2) collecting labeled datasets hinders scaling up for various tasks. To tackle the limitations, we propose a novel strategy that leverages multiple experts where each expert is specialized in a particular noise range and guides the reverse process at its corresponding timesteps. However, as it is infeasible to manage multiple networks and utilize labeled data, we present a practical guidance framework termed Practical Plug-And-Play (PPAP), which leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning and data-free knowledge transfer. We exhaustively conduct ImageNet class conditional generation experiments to show that our method can successfully guide diffusion with small trainable parameters and no labeled data. Finally, we show that image classifiers, depth estimators, and semantic segmentation models can guide publicly available GLIDE through our framework in a plug-and-play manner. 

### [A Pre-Trained BERT Model for Android Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05976)
The automation of an increasingly large number of software engineering tasks is becoming possible thanks to Machine Learning (ML). One foundational building block in the application of ML to software artifacts is the representation of these artifacts (e.g., source code or executable code) into a form that is suitable for learning. Many studies have leveraged representation learning, delegating to ML itself the job of automatically devising suitable representations. Yet, in the context of Android problems, existing models are either limited to coarse-grained whole-app level (e.g., apk2vec) or conducted for one specific downstream task (e.g., smali2vec). Our work is part of a new line of research that investigates effective, task-agnostic, and fine-grained universal representations of bytecode to mitigate both of these two limitations. Such representations aim to capture information relevant to various low-level downstream tasks (e.g., at the class-level). We are inspired by the field of Natural Language Processing, where the problem of universal representation was addressed by building Universal Language Models, such as BERT, whose goal is to capture abstract semantic information about sentences, in a way that is reusable for a variety of tasks. We propose DexBERT, a BERT-like Language Model dedicated to representing chunks of DEX bytecode, the main binary format used in Android applications. We empirically assess whether DexBERT is able to model the DEX language and evaluate the suitability of our model in two distinct class-level software engineering tasks: Malicious Code Localization and Defect Prediction. We also experiment with strategies to deal with the problem of catering to apps having vastly different sizes, and we demonstrate one example of using our technique to investigate what information is relevant to a given task. 

### [MegaCRN: Meta-Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal  Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05989)
Spatio-temporal modeling as a canonical task of multivariate time series forecasting has been a significant research topic in AI community. To address the underlying heterogeneity and non-stationarity implied in the graph streams, in this study, we propose Spatio-Temporal Meta-Graph Learning as a novel Graph Structure Learning mechanism on spatio-temporal data. Specifically, we implement this idea into Meta-Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MegaCRN) by plugging the Meta-Graph Learner powered by a Meta-Node Bank into GCRN encoder-decoder. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets (METR-LA and PEMS-BAY) and a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset that contains a variaty of non-stationary phenomena. Our model outperformed the state-of-the-arts to a large degree on all three datasets (over 27% MAE and 34% RMSE). Besides, through a series of qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our model can explicitly disentangle locations and time slots with different patterns and be robustly adaptive to different anomalous situations. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/deepkashiwa20/MegaCRN. 

### [Generative Scene Synthesis via Incremental View Inpainting using RGBD  Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05993)
We address the challenge of recovering an underlying scene geometry and colors from a sparse set of RGBD view observations. In this work, we present a new solution that sequentially generates novel RGBD views along a camera trajectory, and the scene geometry is simply the fusion result of these views. More specifically, we maintain an intermediate surface mesh used for rendering new RGBD views, which subsequently becomes complete by an inpainting network; each rendered RGBD view is later back-projected as a partial surface and is supplemented into the intermediate mesh. The use of intermediate mesh and camera projection helps solve the refractory problem of multi-view inconsistency. We practically implement the RGBD inpainting network as a versatile RGBD diffusion model, which is previously used for 2D generative modeling; we make a modification to its reverse diffusion process to enable our use. We evaluate our approach on the task of 3D scene synthesis from sparse RGBD inputs; extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing ones.

### [Dirichlet-Survival Process: Scalable Inference of Topic-Dependent  Diffusion Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05996)
Information spread on networks can be efficiently modeled by considering three features: documents' content, time of publication relative to other publications, and position of the spreader in the network. Most previous works model up to two of those jointly, or rely on heavily parametric approaches. Building on recent Dirichlet-Point processes literature, we introduce the Houston (Hidden Online User-Topic Network) model, that jointly considers all those features in a non-parametric unsupervised framework. It infers dynamic topic-dependent underlying diffusion networks in a continuous-time setting along with said topics. It is unsupervised; it considers an unlabeled stream of triplets shaped as \textit{(time of publication, information's content, spreading entity)} as input data. Online inference is conducted using a sequential Monte-Carlo algorithm that scales linearly with the size of the dataset. Our approach yields consequent improvements over existing baselines on both cluster recovery and subnetworks inference tasks. 

### [A Neural ODE Interpretation of Transformer Layers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06011)
Transformer layers, which use an alternating pattern of multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers, provide an effective tool for a variety of machine learning problems. As the transformer layers use residual connections to avoid the problem of vanishing gradients, they can be viewed as the numerical integration of a differential equation. In this extended abstract, we build upon this connection and propose a modification of the internal architecture of a transformer layer. The proposed model places the multi-head attention sublayer and the MLP sublayer parallel to each other. Our experiments show that this simple modification improves the performance of transformer networks in multiple tasks. Moreover, for the image classification task, we show that using neural ODE solvers with a sophisticated integration scheme further improves performance. 

### [The Stable Artist: Steering Semantics in Diffusion Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06013)
Large, text-conditioned generative diffusion models have recently gained a lot of attention for their impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images from text alone. However, achieving high-quality results is almost unfeasible in a one-shot fashion. On the contrary, text-guided image generation involves the user making many slight changes to inputs in order to iteratively carve out the envisioned image. However, slight changes to the input prompt often lead to entirely different images being generated, and thus the control of the artist is limited in its granularity. To provide flexibility, we present the Stable Artist, an image editing approach enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process. The main component is semantic guidance (SEGA) which steers the diffusion process along variable numbers of semantic directions. This allows for subtle edits to images, changes in composition and style, as well as optimization of the overall artistic conception. Furthermore, SEGA enables probing of latent spaces to gain insights into the representation of concepts learned by the model, even complex ones such as 'carbon emission'. We demonstrate the Stable Artist on several tasks, showcasing high-quality image editing and composition. 

### [Video Prediction by Efficient Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06026)
Video prediction is a challenging computer vision task that has a wide range of applications. In this work, we present a new family of Transformer-based models for video prediction. Firstly, an efficient local spatial-temporal separation attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the complexity of standard Transformers. Then, a full autoregressive model, a partial autoregressive model and a non-autoregressive model are developed based on the new efficient Transformer. The partial autoregressive model has a similar performance with the full autoregressive model but a faster inference speed. The non-autoregressive model not only achieves a faster inference speed but also mitigates the quality degradation problem of the autoregressive counterparts, but it requires additional parameters and loss function for learning. Given the same attention mechanism, we conducted a comprehensive study to compare the proposed three video prediction variants. Experiments show that the proposed video prediction models are competitive with more complex state-of-the-art convolutional-LSTM based models. The source code is available at https://github.com/XiYe20/VPTR. 

### [Technological taxonomies for hypernym and hyponym retrieval in patent  texts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06039)
This paper presents an automatic approach to creating taxonomies of technical terms based on the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC). The resulting taxonomy contains about 170k nodes in 9 separate technological branches and is freely available. We also show that a Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model can be fine-tuned to generate hypernyms and hyponyms with relatively high precision, confirming the manually assessed quality of the resource. The T5 model opens the taxonomy to any new technological terms for which a hypernym can be generated, thus making the resource updateable with new terms, an essential feature for the constantly evolving field of technological terminology. 

### [Semantic Decomposition Improves Learning of Large Language Models on EHR  Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06040)
Electronic health records (EHR) are widely believed to hold a profusion of actionable insights, encrypted in an irregular, semi-structured format, amidst a loud noise background. To simplify learning patterns of health and disease, medical codes in EHR can be decomposed into semantic units connected by hierarchical graphs. Building on earlier synergy between Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), we present H-BERT, which ingests complete graph tree expansions of hierarchical medical codes as opposed to only ingesting the leaves and pushes patient-level labels down to each visit. This methodology significantly improves prediction of patient membership in over 500 medical diagnosis classes as measured by aggregated AUC and APS, and creates distinct representations of patients in closely related but clinically distinct phenotypes. 

### [Sentiment Analysis of Persian Language: Review of Algorithms, Approaches  and Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06041)
Sentiment analysis aims to extract people's emotions and opinion from their comments on the web. It widely used in businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers. Most of articles in this area have concentrated on the English language whereas there are limited resources for Persian language. In this review paper, recent published articles between 2018 and 2022 in sentiment analysis in Persian Language have been collected and their methods, approach and dataset will be explained and analyzed. Almost all the methods used to solve sentiment analysis are machine learning and deep learning. The purpose of this paper is to examine 40 different approach sentiment analysis in the Persian Language, analysis datasets along with the accuracy of the algorithms applied to them and also review strengths and weaknesses of each. Among all the methods, transformers such as BERT and RNN Neural Networks such as LSTM and Bi-LSTM have achieved higher accuracy in the sentiment analysis. In addition to the methods and approaches, the datasets reviewed are listed between 2018 and 2022 and information about each dataset and its details are provided. 

### [AD-BERT: Using Pre-trained contextualized embeddings to Predict the  Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06042)
Objective: We develop a deep learning framework based on the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model using unstructured clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict the risk of disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Materials and Methods: We identified 3657 patients diagnosed with MCI together with their progress notes from Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) between 2000-2020. The progress notes no later than the first MCI diagnosis were used for the prediction. We first preprocessed the notes by deidentification, cleaning and splitting, and then pretrained a BERT model for AD (AD-BERT) based on the publicly available Bio+Clinical BERT on the preprocessed notes. The embeddings of all the sections of a patient's notes processed by AD-BERT were combined by MaxPooling to compute the probability of MCI-to-AD progression. For replication, we conducted a similar set of experiments on 2563 MCI patients identified at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) during the same timeframe. Results: Compared with the 7 baseline models, the AD-BERT model achieved the best performance on both datasets, with Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.8170 and F1 score of 0.4178 on NMEDW dataset and AUC of 0.8830 and F1 score of 0.6836 on WCM dataset. Conclusion: We developed a deep learning framework using BERT models which provide an effective solution for prediction of MCI-to-AD progression using clinical note analysis. 

### [Reinforcement Learning Applied to Trading Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06064)
Financial domain tasks, such as trading in market exchanges, are challenging and have long attracted researchers. The recent achievements and the consequent notoriety of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have also increased its adoption in trading tasks. RL uses a framework with well-established formal concepts, which raises its attractiveness in learning profitable trading strategies. However, RL use without due attention in the financial area can prevent new researchers from following standards or failing to adopt relevant conceptual guidelines. In this work, we embrace the seminal RL technical fundamentals, concepts, and recommendations to perform a unified, theoretically-grounded examination and comparison of previous research that could serve as a structuring guide for the field of study. A selection of twenty-nine articles was reviewed under our classification that considers RL's most common formulations and design patterns from a large volume of available studies. This classification allowed for precise inspection of the most relevant aspects regarding data input, preprocessing, state and action composition, adopted RL techniques, evaluation setups, and overall results. Our analysis approach organized around fundamental RL concepts allowed for a clear identification of current system design best practices, gaps that require further investigation, and promising research opportunities. Finally, this review attempts to promote the development of this field of study by facilitating researchers' commitment to standards adherence and helping them to avoid straying away from the RL constructs' firm ground. 

### [Resolving Semantic Confusions for Improved Zero-Shot Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06097)
Zero-shot detection (ZSD) is a challenging task where we aim to recognize and localize objects simultaneously, even when our model has not been trained with visual samples of a few target ("unseen") classes. Recently, methods employing generative models like GANs have shown some of the best results, where unseen-class samples are generated based on their semantics by a GAN trained on seen-class data, enabling vanilla object detectors to recognize unseen objects. However, the problem of semantic confusion still remains, where the model is sometimes unable to distinguish between semantically-similar classes. In this work, we propose to train a generative model incorporating a triplet loss that acknowledges the degree of dissimilarity between classes and reflects them in the generated samples. Moreover, a cyclic-consistency loss is also enforced to ensure that generated visual samples of a class highly correspond to their own semantics. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ZSD datasets - MSCOCO and PASCAL-VOC - demonstrate significant gains over the current ZSD methods, reducing semantic confusion and improving detection for the unseen classes. 

### [Rodin: A Generative Model for Sculpting 3D Digital Avatars Using  Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06135)
This paper presents a 3D generative model that uses diffusion models to automatically generate 3D digital avatars represented as neural radiance fields. A significant challenge in generating such avatars is that the memory and processing costs in 3D are prohibitive for producing the rich details required for high-quality avatars. To tackle this problem we propose the roll-out diffusion network (Rodin), which represents a neural radiance field as multiple 2D feature maps and rolls out these maps into a single 2D feature plane within which we perform 3D-aware diffusion. The Rodin model brings the much-needed computational efficiency while preserving the integrity of diffusion in 3D by using 3D-aware convolution that attends to projected features in the 2D feature plane according to their original relationship in 3D. We also use latent conditioning to orchestrate the feature generation for global coherence, leading to high-fidelity avatars and enabling their semantic editing based on text prompts. Finally, we use hierarchical synthesis to further enhance details. The 3D avatars generated by our model compare favorably with those produced by existing generative techniques. We can generate highly detailed avatars with realistic hairstyles and facial hair like beards. We also demonstrate 3D avatar generation from image or text as well as text-guided editability. 

### [NMS Strikes Back](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06137)
Detection Transformer (DETR) directly transforms queries to unique objects by using one-to-one bipartite matching during training and enables end-to-end object detection. Recently, these models have surpassed traditional detectors on COCO with undeniable elegance. However, they differ from traditional detectors in multiple designs, including model architecture and training schedules, and thus the effectiveness of one-to-one matching is not fully understood. In this work, we conduct a strict comparison between the one-to-one Hungarian matching in DETRs and the one-to-many label assignments in traditional detectors with non-maximum supervision (NMS). Surprisingly, we observe one-to-many assignments with NMS consistently outperform standard one-to-one matching under the same setting, with a significant gain of up to 2.5 mAP. Our detector that trains Deformable-DETR with traditional IoU-based label assignment achieved 50.2 COCO mAP within 12 epochs (1x schedule) with ResNet50 backbone, outperforming all existing traditional or transformer-based detectors in this setting. On multiple datasets, schedules, and architectures, we consistently show bipartite matching is unnecessary for performant detection transformers. Furthermore, we attribute the success of detection transformers to their expressive transformer architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/jozhang97/DETA. 

### [CLIP Itself is a Strong Fine-tuner: Achieving 85.7% and 88.0% Top-1  Accuracy with ViT-B and ViT-L on ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06138)
Recent studies have shown that CLIP has achieved remarkable success in performing zero-shot inference while its fine-tuning performance is not satisfactory. In this paper, we identify that fine-tuning performance is significantly impacted by hyper-parameter choices. We examine various key hyper-parameters and empirically evaluate their impact in fine-tuning CLIP for classification tasks through a comprehensive study. We find that the fine-tuning performance of CLIP is substantially underestimated. Equipped with hyper-parameter refinement, we demonstrate CLIP itself is better or at least competitive in fine-tuning compared with large-scale supervised pre-training approaches or latest works that use CLIP as prediction targets in Masked Image Modeling. Specifically, CLIP ViT-Base/16 and CLIP ViT-Large/14 can achieve 85.7%,88.0% finetuning Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset . These observations challenge the conventional conclusion that CLIP is not suitable for fine-tuning, and motivate us to rethink recently proposed improvements based on CLIP. We will release our code publicly at \url{https://github.com/LightDXY/FT-CLIP}. 

### [The entropy production of stationary diffusions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05125)
The entropy production rate is a central quantity in non-equilibrium statistical physics, scoring how far a stochastic process is from being time-reversible. In this paper, we compute the entropy production of diffusion processes at non-equilibrium steady-state under the condition that the time-reversal of the diffusion remains a diffusion. We start by characterising the entropy production of both discrete and continuous-time Markov processes. We investigate the time-reversal of time-homogeneous stationary diffusions and recall the most general conditions for the reversibility of the diffusion property, which includes hypoelliptic and degenerate diffusions, and locally Lipschitz vector fields. We decompose the drift into its time-reversible and irreversible parts, or equivalently, the generator into symmetric and antisymmetric operators. We show the equivalence with a decomposition of the backward Kolmogorov equation considered in hypocoercivity theory, and a decomposition of the Fokker-Planck equation in GENERIC form. The main result shows that when the time-irreversible part of the drift is in the range of the volatility matrix (almost everywhere) the forward and time-reversed path space measures of the process are mutually equivalent, and evaluates the entropy production. When this does not hold, the measures are mutually singular and the entropy production is infinite. We verify these results using exact numerical simulations of linear diffusions. We illustrate the discrepancy between the entropy production of non-linear diffusions and their numerical simulations in several examples and illustrate how the entropy production can be used for accurate numerical simulation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between time-irreversibility and sampling efficiency, and how we can modify the definition of entropy production to score how far a process is from being generalised reversible. 

### [Walkability Optimization: Formulations, Algorithms, and a Case Study of  Toronto](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05192)
The concept of walkable urban development has gained increased attention due to its public health, economic, and environmental sustainability benefits. Unfortunately, land zoning and historic under-investment have resulted in spatial inequality in walkability and social inequality among residents. We tackle the problem of Walkability Optimization through the lens of combinatorial optimization. The task is to select locations in which additional amenities (e.g., grocery stores, schools, restaurants) can be allocated to improve resident access via walking while taking into account existing amenities and providing multiple options (e.g., for restaurants). To this end, we derive Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) models. Moreover, we show that the problem's objective function is submodular in special cases, which motivates an efficient greedy heuristic. We conduct a case study on 31 underserved neighborhoods in the City of Toronto, Canada. MILP finds the best solutions in most scenarios but does not scale well with network size. The greedy algorithm scales well and finds near-optimal solutions. Our empirical evaluation shows that neighbourhoods with low walkability have a great potential for transformation into pedestrian-friendly neighbourhoods by strategically placing new amenities. Allocating 3 additional grocery stores, schools, and restaurants can improve the "WalkScore" by more than 50 points (on a scale of 100) for 4 neighbourhoods and reduce the walking distances to amenities for 75% of all residential locations to 10 minutes for all amenity types.

### [CTT-Net: A Multi-view Cross-token Transformer for Cataract Postoperative  Visual Acuity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05794)
Surgery is the only viable treatment for cataract patients with visual acuity (VA) impairment. Clinically, to assess the necessity of cataract surgery, accurately predicting postoperative VA before surgery by analyzing multi-view optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is crucially needed. Unfortunately, due to complicated fundus conditions, determining postoperative VA remains difficult for medical experts. Deep learning methods for this problem were developed in recent years. Although effective, these methods still face several issues, such as not efficiently exploring potential relations between multi-view OCT images, neglecting the key role of clinical prior knowledge (e.g., preoperative VA value), and using only regression-based metrics which are lacking reference. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-token Transformer Network (CTT-Net) for postoperative VA prediction by analyzing both the multi-view OCT images and preoperative VA. To effectively fuse multi-view features of OCT images, we develop cross-token attention that could restrict redundant/unnecessary attention flow. Further, we utilize the preoperative VA value to provide more information for postoperative VA prediction and facilitate fusion between views. Moreover, we design an auxiliary classification loss to improve model performance and assess VA recovery more sufficiently, avoiding the limitation by only using the regression metrics. To evaluate CTT-Net, we build a multi-view OCT image dataset collected from our collaborative hospital. A set of extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model compared to existing methods in various metrics. Code is available at: https://github.com/wjh892521292/Cataract OCT.
