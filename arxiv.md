        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Automated Program Repair (APR) can help developers automatically generate patches for bugs. Due to the impressive performance obtained using Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs) on many code related tasks, researchers have started to directly use LLMs for APR. However, prior approaches simply repeatedly sample the LLM given the same constructed input/prompt created from the original buggy code, which not only leads to generating the same incorrect patches repeatedly but also miss the critical information in testcases. To address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback. As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation feedback to help the model understand the semantic meaning of the program under test. We evaluate 10 different LLM including the newly developed ChatGPT model to demonstrate the improvement of conversational APR over the prior LLM for APR approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recent surge in popularity of diffusion models for image generation has brought new attention to the potential of these models in other areas of media generation. One area that has yet to be fully explored is the application of diffusion models to audio generation. Audio generation requires an understanding of multiple aspects, such as the temporal dimension, long term structure, multiple layers of overlapping sounds, and the nuances that only trained listeners can detect. In this work, we investigate the potential of diffusion models for audio generation. We propose a set of models to tackle multiple aspects, including a new method for text-conditional latent audio diffusion with stacked 1D U-Nets, that can generate multiple minutes of music from a textual description. For each model, we make an effort to maintain reasonable inference speed, targeting real-time on a single consumer GPU. In addition to trained models, we provide a collection of open source libraries with the hope of simplifying future work in the field. Samples can be found at https://bit.ly/audio-diffusion.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Consistency is a key requirement of high-quality translation. It is especially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and corrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT) has achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However, real-time adaptation remains challenging. Large-scale language models (LLMs) have recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they learn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, without further fine-tuning. By feeding an LLM with a prompt that consists of a list of translation pairs, it can then simulate the domain and style characteristics at inference time. This work aims to investigate how we can utilize in-context learning to improve real-time adaptive MT. Our extensive experiments show promising results at translation time. For example, GPT-3.5 can adapt to a set of in-domain sentence pairs and/or terminology while translating a new sentence. We observe that the translation quality with few-shot in-context learning can surpass that of strong encoder-decoder MT systems, especially for high-resource languages. Moreover, we investigate whether we can combine MT from strong encoder-decoder models with fuzzy matches, which can further improve the translation, especially for less supported languages. We conduct our experiments across five diverse languages, namely English-to-Arabic (EN-AR), English-to-Chinese (EN-ZH), English-to-French (EN-FR), English-to-Kinyarwanda (EN-RW), and English-to-Spanish (EN-ES) language pairs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: It is well established that increasing scale in deep transformer networks leads to improved quality and performance. This increase in scale often comes with an increase in compute cost and inference latency. Consequently, research into methods which help realize the benefits of increased scale without leading to an increase in the compute cost becomes important. We introduce Alternating Updates (AltUp), a simple-to-implement method to increase a model's capacity without the computational burden. AltUp enables the widening of the learned representation without increasing the computation time by working on a subblock of the representation at each layer. Our experiments on various transformer models and language tasks demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of alternating updates on a diverse set of benchmarks. Finally, we present extensions of AltUp to the sequence dimension, and demonstrate how AltUp can be synergistically combined with existing approaches, such as Sparse Mixture-of-Experts models, to obtain efficient models with even higher capacity. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A framework performing Visual Commonsense Reasoning(VCR) needs to choose an answer and further provide a rationale justifying based on the given image and question, where the image contains all the facts for reasoning and requires to be sufficiently understood. Previous methods use a detector applied on the image to obtain a set of visual objects without considering the exact positions of them in the scene, which is inadequate for properly understanding spatial and semantic relationships between objects. In addition, VCR samples are quite diverse, and parameters of the framework tend to be trained suboptimally based on mini-batches. To address above challenges, pseudo 3D perception Transformer with multi-level confidence optimization named PPTMCO is proposed for VCR in this paper. Specifically, image depth is introduced to represent pseudo 3-dimension(3D) positions of objects along with 2-dimension(2D) coordinates in the image and further enhance visual features. Then, considering that relationships between objects are influenced by depth, depth-aware Transformer is proposed to do attention mechanism guided by depth differences from answer words and objects to objects, where each word is tagged with pseudo depth value according to related objects. To better optimize parameters of the framework, a model parameter estimation method is further proposed to weightedly integrate parameters optimized by mini-batches based on multi-level reasoning confidence. Experiments on the benchmark VCR dataset demonstrate the proposed framework performs better against the state-of-the-art approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Modeling spatiotemporal dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Transformer models have been very successful in NLP and computer vision where they provide interpretable representations of data. However, a limitation of transformers in modeling continuous dynamical systems is that they are fundamentally discrete time and space models and thus have no guarantees regarding continuous sampling. To address this challenge, we present the Continuous Spatiotemporal Transformer (CST), a new transformer architecture that is designed for the modeling of continuous systems. This new framework guarantees a continuous and smooth output via optimization in Sobolev space. We benchmark CST against traditional transformers as well as other spatiotemporal dynamics modeling methods and achieve superior performance in a number of tasks on synthetic and real systems, including learning brain dynamics from calcium imaging data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a novel solver technique for the anisotropic heat flux equation, aimed at the high level of anisotropy seen in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas. Such problems pose two major challenges: (i) discretization accuracy and (ii) efficient implicit linear solvers. We simultaneously address each of these challenges by constructing a new finite element discretization with excellent accuracy properties, tailored to a novel solver approach based on algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods designed for advective operators. We pose the problem in a mixed formulation, introducing the heat flux as an auxiliary variable and discretizing the temperature and auxiliary fields in a discontinuous Galerkin space. The resulting block matrix system is then reordered and solved using an approach in which two advection operators are inverted using AMG solvers based on approximate ideal restriction (AIR), which is particularly efficient for upwind discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of advection. To ensure that the advection operators are non-singular, in this paper we restrict ourselves to considering open (acyclic) magnetic field lines. We demonstrate the proposed discretization's superior accuracy over other discretizations of anisotropic heat flux, achieving error $1000\times$ smaller for anisotropy ratio of $10^9$, while also demonstrating fast convergence of the proposed iterative solver in highly anisotropic regimes where other diffusion-based AMG methods fail. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this study, we propose Shortcut Fine-tuning (SFT), a new approach for addressing the challenge of fast sampling of pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SFT advocates for the fine-tuning of DDPM samplers through the direct minimization of Integral Probability Metrics (IPM), instead of learning the backward diffusion process. This enables samplers to discover an alternative and more efficient sampling shortcut, deviating from the backward diffusion process. We also propose a new algorithm that is similar to the policy gradient method for fine-tuning DDPMs by proving that under certain assumptions, the gradient descent of diffusion models is equivalent to the policy gradient approach. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our fine-tuning method can further enhance existing fast DDPM samplers, resulting in sample quality comparable to or even surpassing that of the full-step model across various datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Effective evaluation methods remain a significant challenge for research on open-domain conversational dialogue systems. Explicit satisfaction ratings can be elicited from users, but users often do not provide ratings when asked, and those they give can be highly subjective. Post-hoc ratings by experts are an alternative, but these can be both expensive and complex to collect. Here, we explore the creation of automated methods for predicting both expert and user ratings of open-domain dialogues. We compare four different approaches. First, we train a baseline model using an end-to-end transformer to predict ratings directly from the raw dialogue text. The other three methods are variants of a two-stage approach in which we first extract interpretable features at the turn level that capture, among other aspects, user dialogue behaviors indicating contradiction, repetition, disinterest, compliments, or criticism. We project these features to the dialogue level and train a dialogue-level MLP regression model, a dialogue-level LSTM, and a novel causal inference model called counterfactual-LSTM (CF-LSTM) to predict ratings. The proposed CF-LSTM is a sequential model over turn-level features which predicts ratings using multiple regressors depending on hypotheses derived from the turn-level features. As a causal inference model, CF-LSTM aims to learn the underlying causes of a specific event, such as a low rating. We also bin the user ratings and perform classification experiments with all four models. In evaluation experiments on conversational data from the Alexa Prize SocialBot, we show that the CF-LSTM achieves the best performance for predicting dialogue ratings and classification. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-3 offer unique testbeds for exploring the translation challenges of turning literacy into numeracy. Previous publicly-available transformer models from eighteen months prior and 1000 times smaller failed to provide basic arithmetic. The statistical analysis of four complex datasets described here combines arithmetic manipulations that cannot be memorized or encoded by simple rules. The work examines whether next-token prediction succeeds from sentence completion into the realm of actual numerical understanding. For example, the work highlights cases for descriptive statistics on in-memory datasets that the LLM initially loads from memory or generates randomly using python libraries. The resulting exploratory data analysis showcases the model's capabilities to group by or pivot categorical sums, infer feature importance, derive correlations, and predict unseen test cases using linear regression. To extend the model's testable range, the research deletes and appends random rows such that recall alone cannot explain emergent numeracy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pitch and meter are two fundamental music features for symbolic music generation tasks, where researchers usually choose different encoding methods depending on specific goals. However, the advantages and drawbacks of different encoding methods have not been frequently discussed. This paper presents a integrated analysis of the influence of two low-level feature, pitch and meter, on the performance of a token-based sequential music generation model. First, the commonly used MIDI number encoding and a less used class-octave encoding are compared. Second, an dense intra-bar metric grid is imposed to the encoded sequence as auxiliary features. Different complexity and resolutions of the metric grid are compared. For complexity, the single token approach and the multiple token approach are compared; for grid resolution, 0 (ablation), 1 (bar-level), 4 (downbeat-level) 12, (8th-triplet-level) up to 64 (64th-note-grid-level) are compared; for duration resolution, 4, 8, 12 and 16 subdivisions per beat are compared. All different encodings are tested on separately trained Transformer-XL models for a melody generation task. Regarding distribution similarity of several objective evaluation metrics to the test dataset, results suggest that the class-octave encoding significantly outperforms the taken-for-granted MIDI encoding on pitch-related metrics; finer grids and multiple-token grids improve the rhythmic quality, but also suffer from over-fitting at early training stage. Results display a general phenomenon of over-fitting from two aspects, the pitch embedding space and the test loss of the single-token grid encoding. From a practical perspective, we both demonstrate the feasibility and raise the concern of easy over-fitting problem of using smaller networks and lower embedding dimensions on the generation task. The findings can also contribute to futural models in terms of feature engineering. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The StyleGAN family succeed in high-fidelity image generation and allow for flexible and plausible editing of generated images by manipulating the semantic-rich latent style space.However, projecting a real image into its latent space encounters an inherent trade-off between inversion quality and editability. Existing encoder-based or optimization-based StyleGAN inversion methods attempt to mitigate the trade-off but see limited performance. To fundamentally resolve this problem, we propose a novel two-phase framework by designating two separate networks to tackle editing and reconstruction respectively, instead of balancing the two. Specifically, in Phase I, a W-space-oriented StyleGAN inversion network is trained and used to perform image inversion and editing, which assures the editability but sacrifices reconstruction quality. In Phase II, a carefully designed rectifying network is utilized to rectify the inversion errors and perform ideal reconstruction. Experimental results show that our approach yields near-perfect reconstructions without sacrificing the editability, thus allowing accurate manipulation of real images. Further, we evaluate the performance of our rectifying network, and see great generalizability towards unseen manipulation types and out-of-domain images. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

These methods typically prioritize accuracy, resulting in large network sizes and excessive computational complexity, which may hinder their practical application in real-world scenarios, such as virtual reality systems. To address this issue, we introduce a modular multi-stage lightweight graph-based transformer network for human pose and shape estimation from 2D human pose, a pose-based human mesh reconstruction approach that prioritizes computational efficiency without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Our method consists of a 2D-to-3D lifter module that utilizes graph transformers to analyze structured and implicit joint correlations in 2D human poses, and a mesh regression module that combines the extracted pose features with a mesh template to produce the final human mesh parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generating photo-realistic video portrait with arbitrary speech audio is a crucial problem in film-making and virtual reality. Recently, several works explore the usage of neural radiance field in this task to improve 3D realness and image fidelity. However, the generalizability of previous NeRF-based methods to out-of-domain audio is limited by the small scale of training data. In this work, we propose GeneFace, a generalized and high-fidelity NeRF-based talking face generation method, which can generate natural results corresponding to various out-of-domain audio. Specifically, we learn a variaitional motion generator on a large lip-reading corpus, and introduce a domain adaptative post-net to calibrate the result. Moreover, we learn a NeRF-based renderer conditioned on the predicted facial motion. A head-aware torso-NeRF is proposed to eliminate the head-torso separation problem. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves more generalized and high-fidelity talking face generation compared to previous methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Monocular scene reconstruction from posed images is challenging due to the complexity of a large environment. Recent volumetric methods learn to directly predict the TSDF volume and have demonstrated promising results in this task. However, most methods focus on how to extract and fuse the 2D features to a 3D feature volume, but none of them improve the way how the 3D volume is aggregated. In this work, we propose an SDF transformer network, which replaces the role of 3D CNN for better 3D feature aggregation. To reduce the explosive computation complexity of the 3D multi-head attention, we propose a sparse window attention module, where the attention is only calculated between the non-empty voxels within a local window. Then a top-down-bottom-up 3D attention network is built for 3D feature aggregation, where a dilate-attention structure is proposed to prevent geometry degeneration, and two global modules are employed to equip with global receptive fields. The experiments on multiple datasets show that this 3D transformer network generates a more accurate and complete reconstruction, which outperforms previous methods by a large margin. Remarkably, the mesh accuracy is improved by 41.8%, and the mesh completeness is improved by 25.3% on the ScanNet dataset.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be incredibly effective for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by representing the traditional RL problem as a sequence modelling problem (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). However many of these methods only optimize for high returns, and may not extract much information from a diverse dataset of trajectories. Generalized Decision Transformers (GDTs) (Furuta et al., 2021) have shown that utilizing future trajectory information, in the form of information statistics, can help extract more information from offline trajectory data. Building upon this, we propose Skill Decision Transformer (Skill DT). Skill DT draws inspiration from hindsight relabelling (Andrychowicz et al., 2017) and skill discovery methods to discover a diverse set of primitive behaviors, or skills. We show that Skill DT can not only perform offline state-marginal matching (SMM), but can discovery descriptive behaviors that can be easily sampled. Furthermore, we show that through purely reward-free optimization, Skill DT is still competitive with supervised offline RL approaches on the D4RL benchmark.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Semantic-driven 3D shape generation aims to generate 3D objects conditioned on text. Previous works face problems with single-category generation, low-frequency 3D details, and requiring a large number of paired datasets for training. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-category conditional diffusion model. Specifically, 1) to alleviate the problem of lack of large-scale paired data, we bridge the text, 2D image and 3D shape based on the pre-trained CLIP model, and 2) to obtain the multi-category 3D shape feature, we apply the conditional flow model to generate 3D shape vector conditioned on CLIP embedding. 3) to generate multi-category 3D shape, we employ the hidden-layer diffusion model conditioned on the multi-category shape vector, which greatly reduces the training time and memory consumption. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transfomer-based approaches advance the recent development of multi-camera 3D detection both in academia and industry. In a vanilla transformer architecture, queries are randomly initialised and optimised for the whole dataset, without considering the differences among input frames. In this work, we propose to leverage the predictions from an image backbone, which is often highly optimised for 2D tasks, as priors to the transformer part of a 3D detection network. The method works by (1). augmenting image feature maps with 2D priors, (2). sampling query locations via ray-casting along 2D box centroids, as well as (3). initialising query features with object-level image features. Experimental results shows that 2D priors not only help the model converge faster, but also largely improve the baseline approach by up to 12% in terms of average precision. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Joint machine learning models that allow synthesizing and classifying data often offer uneven performance between those tasks or are unstable to train. In this work, we depart from a set of empirical observations that indicate the usefulness of internal representations built by contemporary deep diffusion-based generative models in both generative and predictive settings. We then introduce an extension of the vanilla diffusion model with a classifier that allows for stable joint training with shared parametrization between those objectives. The resulting joint diffusion model offers superior performance across various tasks, including generative modeling, semi-supervised classification, and domain adaptation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNN) have emerged as the dominant model for spatio-temporal graph (STG) forecasting. Despite their success, they fail to model intrinsic uncertainties within STG data, which cripples their practicality in downstream tasks for decision-making. To this end, this paper focuses on probabilistic STG forecasting, which is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling uncertainties and complex ST dependencies. In this study, we present the first attempt to generalize the popular denoising diffusion probabilistic models to STGs, leading to a novel non-autoregressive framework called DiffSTG, along with the first denoising network UGnet for STG in the framework. Our approach combines the spatio-temporal learning capabilities of STGNNs with the uncertainty measurements of diffusion models. Extensive experiments validate that DiffSTG reduces the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) by 4%-14%, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 2%-7% over existing methods on three real-world datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Extracting precise geographical information from textual contents is crucial in a plethora of applications. For example, during hazardous events, a robust and unbiased toponym extraction framework can provide an avenue to tie the location concerned to the topic discussed by news media posts and pinpoint humanitarian help requests or damage reports from social media. Early studies have leveraged rule-based, gazetteer-based, deep learning, and hybrid approaches to address this problem. However, the performance of existing tools is deficient in supporting operations like emergency rescue, which relies on fine-grained, accurate geographic information. The emerging pretrained language models can better capture the underlying characteristics of text information, including place names, offering a promising pathway to optimize toponym recognition to underpin practical applications. In this paper, TopoBERT, a toponym recognition module based on a one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN1D) and Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), is proposed and fine-tuned. Three datasets (CoNLL2003-Train, Wikipedia3000, WNUT2017) are leveraged to tune the hyperparameters, discover the best training strategy, and train the model. Another two datasets (CoNLL2003-Test and Harvey2017) are used to evaluate the performance. Three distinguished classifiers, linear, multi-layer perceptron, and CNN1D, are benchmarked to determine the optimal model architecture. TopoBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance (f1-score=0.865) compared to the other five baseline models and can be applied to diverse toponym recognition tasks without additional training. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The dynamic Schr\"odinger bridge problem provides an appealing setting for solving optimal transport problems by learning non-linear diffusion processes using efficient iterative solvers. Recent works have demonstrated state-of-the-art results (eg. in modelling single-cell embryo RNA sequences or sampling from complex posteriors) but are limited to learning bridges with only initial and terminal constraints. Our work extends this paradigm by proposing the Iterative Smoothing Bridge (ISB). We integrate Bayesian filtering and optimal control into learning the diffusion process, enabling constrained stochastic processes governed by sparse observations at intermediate stages and terminal constraints. We assess the effectiveness of our method on synthetic and real-world data and show that the ISB generalises well to high-dimensional data, is computationally efficient, and provides accurate estimates of the marginals at intermediate and terminal times. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Expressive text-to-speech (TTS) aims to synthesize different speaking style speech according to human's demands. Nowadays, there are two common ways to control speaking styles: (1) Pre-defining a group of speaking style and using categorical index to denote different speaking style. However, there are limitations in the diversity of expressiveness, as these models can only generate the pre-defined styles. (2) Using reference speech as style input, which results in a problem that the extracted style information is not intuitive or interpretable. In this study, we attempt to use natural language as style prompt to control the styles in the synthetic speech, \textit{e.g.}, ``Sigh tone in full of sad mood with some helpless feeling". Considering that there is no existing TTS corpus which is proper to benchmark this novel task, we first construct a speech corpus, whose speech samples are annotated with not only content transcriptions but also style descriptions in natural language. Then we propose an expressive TTS model, named as InstructTTS, which is novel in the sense of following aspects: (1) We fully take the advantage of self-supervised learning and cross-modal metric learning, and propose a novel three-stage training procedure to obtain a robust sentence embedding model, which can effectively capture semantic information from the style prompts and control the speaking style in the generated speech. (2) We propose to model acoustic features in discrete latent space and train a novel discrete diffusion probabilistic model to generate vector-quantized (VQ) acoustic tokens rather than the commonly-used mel spectrogram. (3) We jointly apply mutual information (MI) estimation and minimization during acoustic model training to minimize style-speaker and style-content MI, avoiding possible content and speaker information leakage from the style prompt. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, there has been a heightened consensus within academia and in the public discourse that Social Media Platforms (SMPs), amplify the spread of hateful and negative sentiment content. Researchers have identified how hateful content, political propaganda, and targeted messaging contributed to real-world harms including insurrections against democratically elected governments, genocide, and breakdown of social cohesion due to heightened negative discourse towards certain communities in parts of the world. To counter these issues, SMPs have created semi-automated systems that can help identify toxic speech. In this paper we analyse the statistical distribution of hateful and negative sentiment contents within a representative Facebook dataset (n= 604,703) scrapped through 648 public Facebook pages which identify themselves as proponents (and followers) of far-right Hindutva actors. These pages were identified manually using keyword searches on Facebook and on CrowdTangleand classified as far-right Hindutva pages based on page names, page descriptions, and discourses shared on these pages. We employ state-of-the-art, open-source XLM-T multilingual transformer-based language models to perform sentiment and hate speech analysis of the textual contents shared on these pages over a period of 5.5 years. The result shows the statistical distributions of the predicted sentiment and the hate speech labels; top actors, and top page categories. We further discuss the benchmark performances and limitations of these pre-trained language models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, targeting to understand the underlying explainable factors behind observations and modeling the conditional generation process on these factors, we propose a new task, disentanglement of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), to take advantage of the remarkable modeling ability of DPMs. To tackle this task, we further devise an unsupervised approach named DisDiff. For the first time, we achieve disentangled representation learning in the framework of diffusion probabilistic models. Given a pre-trained DPM, DisDiff can automatically discover the inherent factors behind the image data and disentangle the gradient fields of DPM into sub-gradient fields, each conditioned on the representation of each discovered factor. We propose a novel Disentangling Loss for DisDiff to facilitate the disentanglement of the representation and sub-gradients. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DisDiff. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite various breakthroughs in machine learning and data analysis techniques for improving smart operation and management of urban water infrastructures, some key limitations obstruct this progress. Among these shortcomings, the absence of freely available data due to data privacy or high costs of data gathering and the nonexistence of adequate rare or extreme events in the available data plays a crucial role. Here, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can help overcome these challenges. In machine learning, generative models are a class of methods capable of learning data distribution to generate artificial data. In this study, we developed a GAN model to generate synthetic time series to balance our limited recorded time series data and improve the accuracy of a data-driven model for combined sewer flow prediction. We considered the sewer system of a small town in Germany as the test case. Precipitation and inflow to the storage tanks are used for the Data-Driven model development. The aim is to predict the flow using precipitation data and examine the impact of data augmentation using synthetic data in model performance. Results show that GAN can successfully generate synthetic time series from real data distribution, which helps more accurate peak flow prediction. However, the model without data augmentation works better for dry weather prediction. Therefore, an ensemble model is suggested to combine the advantages of both models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-world data contains a vast amount of multimodal information, among which vision and language are the two most representative modalities. Moreover, increasingly heavier models, e.g., Transformers, have attracted the attention of researchers to model compression. However, how to compress multimodal models, especially vison-language Transformers, is still under-explored. This paper proposes the \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{P}r\textbf{o}gressive \textbf{P}runing (UPop) as a universal vison-language Transformer compression framework, which incorporates 1) unifiedly searching multimodal subnets in a continuous optimization space from the original model, which enables automatic assignment of pruning ratios among compressible modalities and structures; 2) progressively searching and retraining the subnet, which maintains convergence between the search and retrain to attain higher compression ratios. Experiments on multiple generative and discriminative vision-language tasks, including Visual Reasoning, Image Caption, Visual Question Answer, Image-Text Retrieval, Text-Image Retrieval, and Image Classification, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed UPop framework. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Cross-modality data translation has attracted great interest in image computing. Deep generative models (\textit{e.g.}, GANs) show performance improvement in tackling those problems. Nevertheless, as a fundamental challenge in image translation, the problem of Zero-shot-Learning Cross-Modality Data Translation with fidelity remains unanswered. This paper proposes a new unsupervised zero-shot-learning method named Mutual Information guided Diffusion cross-modality data translation Model (MIDiffusion), which learns to translate the unseen source data to the target domain. The MIDiffusion leverages a score-matching-based generative model, which learns the prior knowledge in the target domain. We propose a differentiable local-wise-MI-Layer ($LMI$) for conditioning the iterative denoising sampling. The $LMI$ captures the identical cross-modality features in the statistical domain for the diffusion guidance; thus, our method does not require retraining when the source domain is changed, as it does not rely on any direct mapping between the source and target domains. This advantage is critical for applying cross-modality data translation methods in practice, as a reasonable amount of source domain dataset is not always available for supervised training. We empirically show the advanced performance of MIDiffusion in comparison with an influential group of generative models, including adversarial-based and other score-matching-based models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

To investigate approaches for the automated detection of human values behind arguments, we collected 9324 arguments from 6 diverse sources, covering religious texts, political discussions, free-text arguments, newspaper editorials, and online democracy platforms. Each argument was annotated by 3 crowdworkers for 54 values. The Touch\'e23-ValueEval dataset extends the Webis-ArgValues-22. In comparison to the previous dataset, the effectiveness of a 1-Baseline decreases, but that of an out-of-the-box BERT model increases.

To fully realize the advantages of ViT in real-world applications, recent works have explored the trustworthiness of ViT, including its robustness and explainability. However, another desiderata, fairness has not yet been adequately addressed in the literature. We establish that the existing fairness-aware algorithms (primarily designed for CNNs) do not perform well on ViT. This necessitates the need for developing our novel framework via Debiased Self-Attention (DSA). DSA is a fairness-through-blindness approach that enforces ViT to eliminate spurious features correlated with the sensitive attributes for bias mitigation. Notably, adversarial examples are leveraged to locate and mask the spurious features in the input image patches. In addition, DSA utilizes an attention weights alignment regularizer in the training objective to encourage learning informative features for target prediction. Importantly, our DSA framework leads to improved fairness guarantees over prior works on multiple prediction tasks without compromising target prediction performance <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent text-to-image generative models have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to generate diverse and creative imagery guided by a target text prompt. While revolutionary, current state-of-the-art diffusion models may still fail in generating images that fully convey the semantics in the given text prompt. We analyze the publicly available Stable Diffusion model and assess the existence of catastrophic neglect, where the model fails to generate one or more of the subjects from the input prompt. Moreover, we find that in some cases the model also fails to correctly bind attributes (e.g., colors) to their corresponding subjects. To help mitigate these failure cases, we introduce the concept of Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN), where we seek to intervene in the generative process on the fly during inference time to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Using an attention-based formulation of GSN, dubbed Attend-and-Excite, we guide the model to refine the cross-attention units to attend to all subject tokens in the text prompt and strengthen - or excite - their activations, encouraging the model to generate all subjects described in the text prompt. We compare our approach to alternative approaches and demonstrate that it conveys the desired concepts more faithfully across a range of text prompts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: ChatGPT has the ability to generate grammatically flawless and seemingly-human replies to different types of questions from various domains. The number of its users and of its applications is growing at an unprecedented rate. Unfortunately, use and abuse come hand in hand. In this paper, we study whether a machine learning model can be effectively trained to accurately distinguish between original human and seemingly human (that is, ChatGPT-generated) text, especially when this text is short. Furthermore, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence framework to gain insight into the reasoning behind the model trained to differentiate between ChatGPT-generated and human-generated text. The goal is to analyze model's decisions and determine if any specific patterns or characteristics can be identified. Our study focuses on short online reviews, conducting two experiments comparing human-generated and ChatGPT-generated text. The first experiment involves ChatGPT text generated from custom queries, while the second experiment involves text generated by rephrasing original human-generated reviews. We fine-tune a Transformer-based model and use it to make predictions, which are then explained using SHAP. We compare our model with a perplexity score-based approach and find that disambiguation between human and ChatGPT-generated reviews is more challenging for the ML model when using rephrased text. However, our proposed approach still achieves an accuracy of 79%. Using explainability, we observe that ChatGPT's writing is polite, without specific details, using fancy and atypical vocabulary, impersonal, and typically it does not express feelings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Education is a right of all, however, every individual is different than others. Teachers in post-communism era discover inherent individualism to equally train all towards job market of fourth industrial revolution. We can consider scenario of ethnic minority education in academic practices. Ethnic minority group has grown in their own culture and would prefer to be taught in their native way. We have formulated such linguistic anthropology(how people learn)based engagement as semi-supervised problem. Then, we have developed an conditional deep generative adversarial network algorithm namely LA-GAN to classify linguistic ethnographic features in student engagement. Theoretical justification proves the objective, regularization and loss function of our semi-supervised adversarial model. Survey questions are prepared to reach some form of assumptions about z-generation and ethnic minority group, whose learning style, learning approach and preference are our main area of interest. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel algorithm, Salient Conditional Diffusion (Sancdifi), a state-of-the-art defense against backdoor attacks. Sancdifi uses a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to degrade an image with noise and then recover said image using the learned reverse diffusion. Critically, we compute saliency map-based masks to condition our diffusion, allowing for stronger diffusion on the most salient pixels by the DDPM. As a result, Sancdifi is highly effective at diffusing out triggers in data poisoned by backdoor attacks. At the same time, it reliably recovers salient features when applied to clean data. This performance is achieved without requiring access to the model parameters of the Trojan network, meaning Sancdifi operates as a black-box defense. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We investigate the mathematical capabilities of ChatGPT by testing it on publicly available datasets, as well as hand-crafted ones, and measuring its performance against other models trained on a mathematical corpus, such as Minerva. We also test whether ChatGPT can be a useful assistant to professional mathematicians by emulating various use cases that come up in the daily professional activities of mathematicians (question answering, theorem searching). In contrast to formal mathematics, where large databases of formal proofs are available (e.g., the Lean Mathematical Library), current datasets of natural-language mathematics, used to benchmark language models, only cover elementary mathematics. We address this issue by introducing a new dataset: GHOSTS. It is the first natural-language dataset made and curated by working researchers in mathematics that (1) aims to cover graduate-level mathematics and (2) provides a holistic overview of the mathematical capabilities of language models. We benchmark ChatGPT on GHOSTS and evaluate performance against fine-grained criteria. We make this new dataset publicly available to assist a community-driven comparison of ChatGPT with (future) large language models in terms of advanced mathematical comprehension. We conclude that contrary to many positive reports in the media (a potential case of selection bias), ChatGPT's mathematical abilities are significantly below those of an average mathematics graduate student. Our results show that ChatGPT often understands the question but fails to provide correct solutions. Hence, if your goal is to use it to pass a university exam, you would be better off copying from your average peer! <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we study dimension reduction techniques for large-scale controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The drift of the considered SDEs contains a polynomial term satisfying a one-sided growth condition. Such nonlinearities in high dimensional settings occur, e.g., when stochastic reaction diffusion equations are discretized in space. We provide a brief discussion around existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions. (Almost) stability then is the basis for new concepts of Gramians that we introduce and study in this work. With the help of these Gramians, dominant subspace are identified leading to a balancing related highly accurate reduced order SDE. We provide an algebraic error criterion and an error analysis of the propose model reduction schemes. The paper is concluded by applying our method to spatially discretized reaction diffusion equations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
