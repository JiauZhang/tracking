        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Since their proposal in the 2014 paper by Ian Goodfellow, there has been an explosion of research into the area of Generative Adversarial Networks. While they have been utilised in many fields, the realm of malware research is a problem space in which GANs have taken root. From balancing datasets to creating unseen examples in rare classes, GAN models offer extensive opportunities for application. This paper surveys the current research and literature for the use of Generative Adversarial Networks in the malware problem space. This is done with the hope that the reader may be able to gain an overall understanding as to what the Generative Adversarial model provides for this field, and for what areas within malware research it is best utilised. It covers the current related surveys, the different categories of GAN, and gives the outcomes of recent research into optimising GANs for different topics, as well as future directions for exploration. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition, links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential developments of AI. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We explore incorporating natural language inference (NLI) into the text generative pipeline by using a pre-trained NLI model to assess whether a generated sentence entails, contradicts, or is neutral to the prompt and preceding text. First, we show that the NLI task is predictive of generation errors made by GPT-3. We use these results to develop an NLI-informed generation procedure for GPT-J. Then, we evaluate these generations by obtaining human annotations on error types and overall quality. We find that an NLI strategy of maximizing entailment improves text generation when the nucleus sampling randomness parameter value is high, while one which maximizes contradiction is in fact productive when the parameter value is low. Overall, though, we demonstrate that an NLI strategy of maximizing the neutral class provides the highest quality of generated text (significantly better than the vanilla generations), regardless of parameter value. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Syntactic parsing is the task of assigning a syntactic structure to a sentence. There are two popular syntactic parsing methods: constituency and dependency parsing. Recent works have used syntactic embeddings based on constituency trees, incremental top-down parsing, and other word syntactic features for brain activity prediction given the text stimuli to study how the syntax structure is represented in the brain's language network. However, the effectiveness of dependency parse trees or the relative predictive power of the various syntax parsers across brain areas, especially for the listening task, is yet unexplored. In this study, we investigate the predictive power of the brain encoding models in three settings: (i) individual performance of the constituency and dependency syntactic parsing based embedding methods, (ii) efficacy of these syntactic parsing based embedding methods when controlling for basic syntactic signals, (iii) relative effectiveness of each of the syntactic embedding methods when controlling for the other. Further, we explore the relative importance of syntactic information (from these syntactic embedding methods) versus semantic information using BERT embeddings. We find that constituency parsers help explain activations in the temporal lobe and middle-frontal gyrus, while dependency parsers better encode syntactic structure in the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. Although semantic signals from BERT are more effective compared to any of the syntactic features or embedding methods, syntactic embedding methods explain additional variance for a few brain regions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we target the problem of uncertain points refinement for image-based LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation (LiDAR PCSS). This problem mainly results from the boundary-blurring problem of convolution neural networks (CNNs) and quantitation loss of spherical projection, which are often hard to avoid for common image-based LiDAR PCSS approaches. We propose a plug-and-play transformer-based uncertain point refiner (TransUPR) to address the problem. Through local feature aggregation, uncertain point localization, and self-attention-based transformer design, TransUPR, integrated into an existing range image-based LiDAR PCSS approach (e.g., CENet), achieves the state-of-the-art performance (68.2% mIoU) on Semantic-KITTI benchmark, which provides a performance improvement of 0.6% on the mIoU. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been very successful for synthesizing the images in a given dataset. The artificially generated images by GANs are very realistic. The GANs have shown potential usability in several computer vision applications, including image generation, image-to-image translation, video synthesis, and others. Conventionally, the generator network is the backbone of GANs, which generates the samples and the discriminator network is used to facilitate the training of the generator network. The discriminator network is usually a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Whereas, the generator network is usually either an Up-CNN for image generation or an Encoder-Decoder network for image-to-image translation. The convolution-based networks exploit the local relationship in a layer, which requires the deep networks to extract the abstract features. Hence, CNNs suffer to exploit the global relationship in the feature space. However, recently developed Transformer networks are able to exploit the global relationship at every layer. The Transformer networks have shown tremendous performance improvement for several problems in computer vision. Motivated from the success of Transformer networks and GANs, recent works have tried to exploit the Transformers in GAN framework for the image/video synthesis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the developments and advancements in GANs utilizing the Transformer networks for computer vision applications. The performance comparison for several applications on benchmark datasets is also performed and analyzed. The conducted survey will be very useful to deep learning and computer vision community to understand the research trends \&amp; gaps related with Transformer-based GANs and to develop the advanced GAN architectures by exploiting the global and local relationships for different applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Contemporary graph learning algorithms are not well-defined for large molecules since they do not consider the hierarchical interactions among the atoms, which are essential to determine the molecular properties of macromolecules. In this work, we propose Multiresolution Graph Transformers (MGT), the first graph transformer architecture that can learn to represent large molecules at multiple scales. MGT can learn to produce representations for the atoms and group them into meaningful functional groups or repeating units. We also introduce Wavelet Positional Encoding (WavePE), a new positional encoding method that can guarantee localization in both spectral and spatial domains. Our approach achieves competitive results on two macromolecule datasets consisting of polymers and peptides. Furthermore, the visualizations, including clustering results on macromolecules and low-dimensional spaces of their representations, demonstrate the capability of our methodology in learning to represent long-range and hierarchical structures. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-world tasks consist of multiple inter-dependent subtasks (e.g., a dirty pan needs to be washed before it can be used for cooking). In this work, we aim to model the causal dependencies between such subtasks from instructional videos describing the task. This is a challenging problem since complete information about the world is often inaccessible from videos, which demands robust learning mechanisms to understand the causal structure of events. We present Multimodal Subtask Graph Generation (MSG2), an approach that constructs a Subtask Graph defining the dependency between a task's subtasks relevant to a task from noisy web videos. Graphs generated by our multimodal approach are closer to human-annotated graphs compared to prior approaches. MSG2 further performs the downstream task of next subtask prediction 85% and 30% more accurately than recent video transformer models in the ProceL and CrossTask datasets, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) method performs well under the intra-domain setups. But cross-domain performance of the model is not satisfying. Domain generalization method has been used to align the feature from different domain extracted by convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. However, the improvement is limited. Recently, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has performed well on various visual tasks. But ViT model relies heavily on pre-training of large-scale dataset, which cannot be satisfied by existing FAS datasets. In this paper, taking the FAS task as an example, we propose Masked Contrastive Autoencoder (MCAE) method to solve this problem using only limited data. Meanwhile in order for a feature extractor to extract common features in live samples from different domains, we combine Masked Image Model (MIM) with supervised contrastive learning to train our model.Some intriguing design principles are summarized for performing MIM pre-training for downstream tasks.We also provide insightful analysis for our method from an information theory perspective. Experimental results show our approach has good performance on extensive public datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Prediction sets have recently been shown to be a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks in a way that provides theoretical guarantees. However, existing techniques have largely targeted settings where the space of labels is simple, so prediction sets can be arbitrary subsets of labels. For structured prediction problems where the space of labels is exponential in size, even prediction sets containing a small fraction of all labels can be exponentially large. In the context of code generation, we propose a solution that considers a restricted set of prediction sets that can compactly be represented as partial programs, which are programs with portions replaced with holes. Given a trained code generation model, our algorithm leverages a programming language's abstract syntax tree to generate a set of programs such that the correct program is in the set with high-confidence. Valuable applications of our algorithm include a Codex-style code generator with holes in uncertain parts of the generated code, which provides a partial program with theoretical guarantees. We evaluate our approach on PICARD (a T5 model for SQL semantic parsing) and Codex (a GPT model for over a dozen programming languages, including Python), demonstrating that our approach generates compact PAC prediction sets. This is the first research contribution that generates PAC prediction sets for generative code models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-to-image synthesis refers to generating visual-realistic and semantically consistent images from given textual descriptions. Previous approaches generate an initial low-resolution image and then refine it to be high-resolution. Despite the remarkable progress, these methods are limited in fully utilizing the given texts and could generate text-mismatched images, especially when the text description is complex. We propose a novel Fine-grained text-image Fusion based Generative Adversarial Networks, dubbed FF-GAN, which consists of two modules: Fine-grained text-image Fusion Block (FF-Block) and Global Semantic Refinement (GSR). The proposed FF-Block integrates an attention block and several convolution layers to effectively fuse the fine-grained word-context features into the corresponding visual features, in which the text information is fully used to refine the initial image with more details. And the GSR is proposed to improve the global semantic consistency between linguistic and visual features during the refinement process. Extensive experiments on CUB-200 and COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of FF-GAN over other state-of-the-art approaches in generating images with semantic consistency to the given texts.Code is available at https://github.com/haoranhfut/FF-GAN. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Anomalies refer to the departure of systems and devices from their normal behaviour in standard operating conditions. An anomaly in an industrial device can indicate an upcoming failure, often in the temporal direction. In this paper, we make two contributions: 1) we estimate conditional quantiles and consider three different ways to define anomalies based on the estimated quantiles. 2) we use a new learnable activation function in the popular Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) architecture to model temporal long-range dependency. In particular, we propose Parametric Elliot Function (PEF) as an activation function (AF) inside LSTM, which saturates lately compared to sigmoid and tanh. The proposed algorithms are compared with other well-known anomaly detection algorithms, such as Isolation Forest (iForest), Elliptic Envelope, Autoencoder, and modern Deep Learning models such as Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The algorithms are evaluated in terms of various performance metrics, such as Precision and Recall. The algorithms have been tested on multiple industrial time-series datasets such as Yahoo, AWS, GE, and machine sensors. We have found that the LSTM-based quantile algorithms are very effective and outperformed the existing algorithms in identifying anomalies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Currently, great numbers of efforts have been put into improving the effectiveness of 3D model quality assessment (3DQA) methods. However, little attention has been paid to the computational costs and inference time, which is also important for practical applications. Unlike 2D media, 3D models are represented by more complicated and irregular digital formats, such as point cloud and mesh. Thus it is normally difficult to perform an efficient module to extract quality-aware features of 3D models. In this paper, we address this problem from the aspect of projection-based 3DQA and develop a no-reference (NR) \underline{E}fficient and \underline{E}ffective \underline{P}rojection-based \underline{3D} Model \underline{Q}uality \underline{A}ssessment (\textbf{EEP-3DQA}) method. The input projection images of EEP-3DQA are randomly sampled from the six perpendicular viewpoints of the 3D model and are further spatially downsampled by the grid-mini patch sampling strategy. Further, the lightweight Swin-Transformer tiny is utilized as the backbone to extract the quality-aware features. Finally, the proposed EEP-3DQA and EEP-3DQA-t (tiny version) achieve the best performance than the existing state-of-the-art NR-3DQA methods and even outperforms most full-reference (FR) 3DQA methods on the point cloud and mesh quality assessment databases while consuming less inference time than the compared 3DQA methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose a novel approach (called GPT4MIA) that utilizes Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as a plug-and-play transductive inference tool for medical image analysis (MIA). We provide theoretical analysis on why a large pre-trained language model such as GPT-3 can be used as a plug-and-play transductive inference model for MIA. At the methodological level, we develop several technical treatments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of GPT4MIA, including better prompt structure design, sample selection, and prompt ordering of representative samples/features. We present two concrete use cases (with workflow) of GPT4MIA: (1) detecting prediction errors and (2) improving prediction accuracy, working in conjecture with well-established vision-based models for image classification (e.g., ResNet). Experiments validate that our proposed method is effective for these two tasks. We further discuss the opportunities and challenges in utilizing Transformer-based large language models for broader MIA applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The rise of emergence of social media platforms has fundamentally altered how people communicate, and among the results of these developments is an increase in online use of abusive content. Therefore, automatically detecting this content is essential for banning inappropriate information, and reducing toxicity and violence on social media platforms. The existing works on hate speech and offensive language detection produce promising results based on pre-trained transformer models, however, they considered only the analysis of abusive content features generated through annotated datasets. This paper addresses a multi-task joint learning approach which combines external emotional features extracted from another corpora in dealing with the imbalanced and scarcity of labeled datasets. Our analysis are using two well-known Transformer-based models, BERT and mBERT, where the later is used to address abusive content detection in multi-lingual scenarios. Our model jointly learns abusive content detection with emotional features by sharing representations through transformers' shared encoder. This approach increases data efficiency, reduce overfitting via shared representations, and ensure fast learning by leveraging auxiliary information. Our findings demonstrate that emotional knowledge helps to more reliably identify hate speech and offensive language across datasets. Our hate speech detection Multi-task model exhibited 3% performance improvement over baseline models, but the performance of multi-task models were not significant for offensive language detection task. More interestingly, in both tasks, multi-task models exhibits less false positive errors compared to single task scenario. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has broken new ground in the novel view synthesis due to its simple concept and state-of-the-art quality. However, it suffers from severe performance degradation unless trained with a dense set of images with different camera poses, which hinders its practical applications. Although previous methods addressing this problem achieved promising results, they relied heavily on the additional training resources, which goes against the philosophy of sparse-input novel-view synthesis pursuing the training efficiency. In this work, we propose MixNeRF, an effective training strategy for novel view synthesis from sparse inputs by modeling a ray with a mixture density model. Our MixNeRF estimates the joint distribution of RGB colors along the ray samples by modeling it with mixture of distributions. We also propose a new task of ray depth estimation as a useful training objective, which is highly correlated with 3D scene geometry. Moreover, we remodel the colors with regenerated blending weights based on the estimated ray depth and further improves the robustness for colors and viewpoints. Our MixNeRF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various standard benchmarks with superior efficiency of training and inference. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion auction is an emerging business model where a seller aims to incentivise buyers in a social network to diffuse the auction information thereby attracting potential buyers. We focus on designing mechanisms for multi-unit diffusion auctions. Despite several attempts at this problem, existing mechanisms are unsatisfactory in one way or another. Here, we propose two new mechanisms for multi-unit diffusion auction: (1) MUDAN which satisfies IC and a weakened form of efficiency, and (2) MUDAR which satisfies efficiency and a weakened form of IC. We define the mechanisms for the bottleneck case of the problem, namely when each buyer demands a single item, to which the more general multi-demand setting can be reduced. Our mechanisms are the first multi-unit diffusion auctions that satisfy a range of desirable properties that include truthfulness and efficiency conditions. This closes the gap left open by the previous work. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In order to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians or cyclists, it is essential that intelligent transportation systems (ITS) accurately identify them. Therefore, datasets used to train perception models of ITS must contain a significant number of vulnerable road users. However, data protection regulations require that individuals are anonymized in such datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning-based pipeline for face anonymization in the context of ITS. In contrast to related methods, we do not use generative adversarial networks (GANs) but build upon recent advances in diffusion models. We propose a two-stage method, which contains a face detection model followed by a latent diffusion model to generate realistic face in-paintings. To demonstrate the versatility of anonymized images, we train segmentation methods on anonymized data and evaluate them on non-anonymized data. Our experiment reveal that our pipeline is better suited to anonymize data for segmentation than naive methods and performes comparably with recent GAN-based methods. Moreover, face detectors achieve higher mAP scores for faces anonymized by our method compared to naive or recent GAN-based methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Modern text classification systems have impressive capabilities but are infeasible to deploy and use reliably due to their dependence on prompting and billion-parameter language models. SetFit (Tunstall et al., 2022) is a recent, practical approach that fine-tunes a Sentence Transformer under a contrastive learning paradigm and achieves similar results to more unwieldy systems. Text classification is important for addressing the problem of domain drift in detecting harmful content, which plagues all social media platforms. Here, we propose Like a Good Nearest Neighbor (LaGoNN), an inexpensive modification to SetFit that requires no additional parameters or hyperparameters but modifies input with information about its nearest neighbor, for example, the label and text, in the training data, making novel data appear similar to an instance on which the model was optimized. LaGoNN is effective at the task of detecting harmful content and generally improves performance compared to SetFit. To demonstrate the value of our system, we conduct a thorough study of text classification systems in the context of content moderation under four label distributions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The task of multimodal referring expression comprehension (REC), aiming at localizing an image region described by a natural language expression, has recently received increasing attention within the research comminity. In this paper, we specifically focus on referring expression comprehension with commonsense knowledge (KB-Ref), a task which typically requires reasoning beyond spatial, visual or semantic information. We propose a novel framework for Commonsense Knowledge Enhanced Transformers (CK-Transformer) which effectively integrates commonsense knowledge into the representations of objects in an image, facilitating identification of the target objects referred to by the expressions. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmarks for the task of KB-Ref. Our results show that the proposed CK-Transformer achieves a new state of the art, with an absolute improvement of 3.14% accuracy over the existing state of the art. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-supervised feature learning enables perception systems to benefit from the vast amount of raw data being recorded by vehicle fleets all over the world. However, their potential to learn dense representations from sequential data has been relatively unexplored. In this work, we propose TempO, a temporal ordering pretext task for pre-training region-level feature representations for perception tasks. We embed each frame by an unordered set of proposal feature vectors, a representation that is natural for instance-level perception architectures, and formulate the sequential ordering prediction by comparing similarities between sets of feature vectors in a transformer-based multi-frame architecture. Extensive evaluation in automated driving domains on the BDD100K and MOT17 datasets shows that our TempO approach outperforms existing self-supervised single-frame pre-training methods as well as supervised transfer learning initialization strategies on standard object detection and multi-object tracking benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper provides a survey of the state of the art of hybrid language models architectures and strategies for "complex" question-answering (QA, CQA, CPS). Very large language models are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, tasks, methods, sensitive data, performance, human approval and versatile feedback... This survey extends findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source, benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of large language models in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...). It identifies the key elements used with Large Language Models (LLM) to solve complex questions or problems. Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed non-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong limitations of language models in complex QA. Hybridizing these models with different components could allow to overcome these different limits and go much further. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including domain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form QA, non-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal search, hallucinations, QA explainability and truthfulness, time dimension. Therefore we review current solutions and promising strategies, using elements such as hybrid LLM architectures, human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, prompting adaptation, neuro-symbolic and structured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, and others. We analyze existing solutions and provide an overview of the current research and trends in the area of complex QA. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Imperfect score-matching leads to a shift between the training and the sampling distribution of diffusion models. Due to the recursive nature of the generation process, errors in previous steps yield sampling iterates that drift away from the training distribution. Yet, the standard training objective via Denoising Score Matching (DSM) is only designed to optimize over non-drifted data. To train on drifted data, we propose to enforce a \emph{consistency} property which states that predictions of the model on its own generated data are consistent across time. Theoretically, we show that if the score is learned perfectly on some non-drifted points (via DSM) and if the consistency property is enforced everywhere, then the score is learned accurately everywhere. Empirically we show that our novel training objective yields state-of-the-art results for conditional and unconditional generation in CIFAR-10 and baseline improvements in AFHQ and FFHQ.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Speaker change detection (SCD) is an important feature that improves the readability of the recognized words from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system by breaking the word sequence into paragraphs at speaker change points. Existing SCD solutions either require additional ensemble for the time based decisions and recognized word sequences, or implement a tight integration between ASR and SCD, limiting the potential optimum performance for both tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for the SCD task, where an additional SCD module is built on top of an existing Transformer Transducer ASR (TT-ASR) network. Two variants of the SCD network are explored in this framework that naturally estimate speaker change probability for each word, while allowing the ASR and SCD to have independent optimization scheme for the best performance. Experiments show that our methods can significantly improve the F1 score on LibriCSS and Microsoft call center data sets without ASR degradation, compared with a joint SCD and ASR baseline. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose a pipeline for real-time video denoising with low runtime cost and high perceptual quality. The vast majority of denoising studies focus on image denoising. However, a minority of research works focusing on video denoising do so with higher performance costs to obtain higher quality while maintaining temporal coherence. The approach we introduce in this paper leverages the advantages of both image and video-denoising architectures. Our pipeline first denoises the keyframes or one-fifth of the frames using HI-GAN blind image denoising architecture. Then, the remaining four-fifths of the noisy frames and the denoised keyframe data are fed into the FastDVDnet video denoising model. The final output is rendered in the user's display in real-time. The combination of these low-latency neural network architectures produces real-time denoising with high perceptual quality with applications in video conferencing and other real-time media streaming systems. A custom noise detector analyzer provides real-time feedback to adapt the weights and improve the models' output. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, Transformer-based architectures have been explored for speaker embedding extraction. Although the Transformer employs the self-attention mechanism to efficiently model the global interaction between token embeddings, it is inadequate for capturing short-range local context, which is essential for the accurate extraction of speaker information. In this study, we enhance the Transformer with the locality modeling in two directions. First, we propose the Locality-Enhanced Conformer (LE-Confomer) by introducing depth-wise convolution and channel-wise attention into the Conformer blocks. Second, we present the Speaker Swin Transformer (SST) by adapting the Swin Transformer, originally proposed for vision tasks, into speaker embedding network. We evaluate the proposed approaches on the VoxCeleb datasets and a large-scale Microsoft internal multilingual (MS-internal) dataset. The proposed models achieve 0.75% EER on VoxCeleb 1 test set, outperforming the previously proposed Transformer-based models and CNN-based models, such as ResNet34 and ECAPA-TDNN. When trained on the MS-internal dataset, the proposed models achieve promising results with 14.6% relative reduction in EER over the Res2Net50 model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Providing small-scale information about weather and climate is challenging, especially for variables strongly controlled by processes that are unresolved by low-resolution (LR) models. This paper explores emerging machine learning methods from the fields of image super-resolution (SR) and deep learning for statistical downscaling of near-surface winds to convection-permitting scales. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are conditioned on LR inputs from a global reanalysis to generate high-resolution (HR) surface winds that emulate those simulated over North America by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Unlike traditional SR models, where LR inputs are idealized coarsened versions of the HR images, WRF emulation involves non-idealized LR inputs from a coarse-resolution reanalysis. In addition to matching the statistical properties of WRF simulations, GANs quickly generate HR fields with impressive realism. However, objectively assessing the realism of the SR models requires careful selection of evaluation metrics. In particular, performance measures based on spatial power spectra reveal the way that GAN configurations change spatial structures in the generated fields, where biases in spatial variability originate, and how models depend on different LR covariates. Inspired by recent computer vision research, a novel methodology that separates spatial frequencies in HR fields is used in an attempt to optimize the SR GANs further. This method, called frequency separation, resulted in deterioration in realism of the generated HR fields. However, frequency separation did show how spatial structures are influenced by the metrics used to optimize the SR models, which led to the development of a more effective partial frequency separation approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
