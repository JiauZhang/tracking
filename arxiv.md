        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-supervised speech representation learning (SSL) has shown to be effective in various downstream tasks, but SSL models are usually large and slow. Model compression techniques such as pruning aim to reduce the model size and computation without degradation in accuracy. Prior studies focus on the pruning of Transformers; however, speech models not only utilize a stack of Transformer blocks, but also combine a frontend network based on multiple convolutional layers for low-level feature representation learning. This frontend has a small size but a heavy computational cost. In this work, we propose three task-specific structured pruning methods to deal with such heterogeneous networks. Experiments on LibriSpeech and SLURP show that the proposed method is more accurate than the original wav2vec2-base with 10% to 30% less computation, and is able to reduce the computation by 40% to 50% without any degradation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Increasing attention is being diverted to data-efficient problem settings like Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) which deals with segmenting an arbitrary object that may or may not be seen during training. The closest standard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS, FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning and the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats existing methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. On a harder setting of 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet beats the baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is widely used to pretrain language models. The standard random masking strategy in MLM causes the pre-trained language models (PLMs) to be biased toward high-frequency tokens. Representation learning of rare tokens is poor and PLMs have limited performance on downstream tasks. To alleviate this frequency bias issue, we propose two simple and effective Weighted Sampling strategies for masking tokens based on the token frequency and training loss. We apply these two strategies to BERT and obtain Weighted-Sampled BERT (WSBERT). Experiments on the Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark (STS) show that WSBERT significantly improves sentence embeddings over BERT. Combining WSBERT with calibration methods and prompt learning further improves sentence embeddings. We also investigate fine-tuning WSBERT on the GLUE benchmark and show that Weighted Sampling also improves the transfer learning capability of the backbone PLM. We further analyze and provide insights into how WSBERT improves token embeddings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Given a document in a source language, cross-lingual summarization (CLS) aims to generate a summary in a different target language. Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. However, it is not yet known the performance of ChatGPT on CLS. In this report, we empirically use various prompts to guide ChatGPT to perform zero-shot CLS from different paradigms (i.e., end-to-end and pipeline), and provide a preliminary evaluation on its generated summaries.We find that ChatGPT originally prefers to produce lengthy summaries with more detailed information. But with the help of an interactive prompt, ChatGPT can balance between informativeness and conciseness, and significantly improve its CLS performance. Experimental results on three widely-used CLS datasets show that ChatGPT outperforms the advanced GPT 3.5 model (i.e., text-davinci-003). In addition, we provide qualitative case studies to show the superiority of ChatGPT on CLS. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Remote sensing scene classification has been extensively studied for its critical roles in geological survey, oil exploration, traffic management, earthquake prediction, wildfire monitoring, and intelligence monitoring. In the past, the Machine Learning (ML) methods for performing the task mainly used the backbones pretrained in the manner of supervised learning (SL). As Masked Image Modeling (MIM), a self-supervised learning (SSL) technique, has been shown as a better way for learning visual feature representation, it presents a new opportunity for improving ML performance on the scene classification task. This research aims to explore the potential of MIM pretrained backbones on four well-known classification datasets: Merced, AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and Optimal-31. Compared to the published benchmarks, we show that the MIM pretrained Vision Transformer (ViTs) backbones outperform other alternatives (up to 18% on top 1 accuracy) and that the MIM technique can learn better feature representation than the supervised learning counterparts (up to 5% on top 1 accuracy). Moreover, we show that the general-purpose MIM-pretrained ViTs can achieve competitive performance as the specially designed yet complicated Transformer for Remote Sensing (TRS) framework. Our experiment results also provide a performance baseline for future studies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While vision transformers have been highly successful in improving the performance in image-based tasks, not much work has been reported on applying transformers to multilingual scene text recognition due to the complexities in the visual appearance of multilingual texts. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an augmented transformer architecture with n-grams embedding and cross-language rectification (TANGER). TANGER consists of a primary transformer with single patch embeddings of visual images, and a supplementary transformer with adaptive n-grams embeddings that aims to flexibly explore the potential correlations between neighbouring visual patches, which is essential for feature extraction from multilingual scene texts. Cross-language rectification is achieved with a loss function that takes into account both language identification and contextual coherence scoring. Extensive comparative studies are conducted on four widely used benchmark datasets as well as a new multilingual scene text dataset containing Indonesian, English, and Chinese collected from tourism scenes in Indonesia. Our experimental results demonstrate that TANGER is considerably better compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in handling complex multilingual scene texts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are usually designed artificially to fool DNNs, but rarely exist in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study the adversarial examples caused by raindrops, to demonstrate that there exist plenty of natural phenomena being able to work as adversarial attackers to DNNs. Moreover, we present a new approach to generate adversarial raindrops, denoted as AdvRD, using the generative adversarial network (GAN) technique to simulate natural raindrops. The images crafted by our AdvRD look very similar to the real-world raindrop images, statistically close to the distribution of true raindrop images, and more importantly, can perform strong adversarial attack to the state-of-the-art DNN models. On the other side, we show that the adversarial training using our AdvRD images can significantly improve the robustness of DNNs to the real-world raindrop attacks. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the images crafted by AdvRD are visually and statistically close to the natural raindrop images, can work as strong attackers to DNN models, and also help improve the robustness of DNNs to raindrop attacks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a graph-oriented attention-based explainability method for tabular data. Tasks involving tabular data have been solved mostly using traditional tree-based machine learning models which have the challenges of feature selection and engineering. With that in mind, we consider a transformer architecture for tabular data, which is amenable to explainability, and present a novel way to leverage self-attention mechanism to provide explanations by taking into account the attention matrices of all layers as a whole. The matrices are mapped to a graph structure where groups of features correspond to nodes and attention values to arcs. By finding the maximum probability paths in the graph, we identify groups of features providing larger contributions to explain the model's predictions. To assess the quality of multi-layer attention-based explanations, we compare them with popular attention-, gradient-, and perturbation-based explanability methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The robustness of deep neural networks is usually lacking under adversarial examples, common corruptions, and distribution shifts, which becomes an important research problem in the development of deep learning. Although new deep learning methods and robustness improvement techniques have been constantly proposed, the robustness evaluations of existing methods are often inadequate due to their rapid development, diverse noise patterns, and simple evaluation metrics. Without thorough robustness evaluations, it is hard to understand the advances in the field and identify the effective methods. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive robustness benchmark called \textbf{ARES-Bench} on the image classification task. In our benchmark, we evaluate the robustness of 55 typical deep learning models on ImageNet with diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers) and learning algorithms (e.g., normal supervised training, pre-training, adversarial training) under numerous adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Using robustness curves as the major evaluation criteria, we conduct large-scale experiments and draw several important findings, including: 1) there is an inherent trade-off between adversarial and natural robustness for the same model architecture; 2) adversarial training effectively improves adversarial robustness, especially when performed on Transformer architectures; 3) pre-training significantly improves natural robustness based on more training data or self-supervised learning. Based on ARES-Bench, we further analyze the training tricks in large-scale adversarial training on ImageNet. By designing the training settings accordingly, we achieve the new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness. We have made the benchmarking results and code platform publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep neural networks (DNNs) may suffer from significantly degenerated performance when the training and test data are of different underlying distributions. Despite the importance of model generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on OOD data can plummet. Recent work has demonstrated that regular or off-manifold adversarial examples, as a special case of data augmentation, can be used to improve OOD generalization. Inspired by this, we theoretically prove that on-manifold adversarial examples can better benefit OOD generalization. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to generate on-manifold adversarial examples because the real manifold is generally complex. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method of Augmenting data with Adversarial examples via a Wavelet module (AdvWavAug), an on-manifold adversarial data augmentation technique that is simple to implement. In particular, we project a benign image into a wavelet domain. With the assistance of the sparsity characteristic of wavelet transformation, we can modify an image on the estimated data manifold. We conduct adversarial augmentation based on AdvProp training framework. Extensive experiments on different models and different datasets, including ImageNet and its distorted versions, demonstrate that our method can improve model generalization, especially on OOD data. By integrating AdvWavAug into the training process, we have achieved SOTA results on some recent transformer-based models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In an effort to address the training instabilities of GANs, we introduce a class of dual-objective GANs with different value functions (objectives) for the generator (G) and discriminator (D). In particular, we model each objective using $\alpha$-loss, a tunable classification loss, to obtain $(\alpha_D,\alpha_G)$-GANs, parameterized by $(\alpha_D,\alpha_G)\in [0,\infty)^2$. For sufficiently large number of samples and capacities for G and D, we show that the resulting non-zero sum game simplifies to minimizing an $f$-divergence under appropriate conditions on $(\alpha_D,\alpha_G)$. In the finite sample and capacity setting, we define estimation error to quantify the gap in the generator's performance relative to the optimal setting with infinite samples and obtain upper bounds on this error, showing it to be order optimal under certain conditions. Finally, we highlight the value of tuning $(\alpha_D,\alpha_G)$ in alleviating training instabilities for the synthetic 2D Gaussian mixture ring and the Stacked MNIST datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, developing an automatic reading system for analog measuring instruments has gained increased attention, as it enables the collection of numerous state of equipment. Nonetheless, two major obstacles still obstruct its deployment to real-world applications. The first issue is that they rarely take the entire pipeline's speed into account. The second is that they are incapable of dealing with some low-quality images (i.e., meter breakage, blur, and uneven scale). In this paper, we propose a human-like alignment and recognition algorithm to overcome these problems. More specifically, a Spatial Transformed Module(STM) is proposed to obtain the front view of images in a self-autonomous way based on an improved Spatial Transformer Networks(STN). Meanwhile, a Value Acquisition Module(VAM) is proposed to infer accurate meter values by an end-to-end trained framework. In contrast to previous research, our model aligns and recognizes meters totally implemented by learnable processing, which mimics human's behaviours and thus achieves higher performances. Extensive results verify the good robustness of the proposed model in terms of the accuracy and efficiency. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In person re-identification (re-ID) task, it is still challenging to learn discriminative representation by deep learning, due to limited data. Generally speaking, the model will get better performance when increasing the amount of data. The addition of similar classes strengthens the ability of the classifier to identify similar identities, thereby improving the discrimination of representation. In this paper, we propose a Diverse and Compact Transformer (DC-Former) that can achieve a similar effect by splitting embedding space into multiple diverse and compact subspaces. Compact embedding subspace helps model learn more robust and discriminative embedding to identify similar classes. And the fusion of these diverse embeddings containing more fine-grained information can further improve the effect of re-ID. Specifically, multiple class tokens are used in vision transformer to represent multiple embedding spaces. Then, a self-diverse constraint (SDC) is applied to these spaces to push them away from each other, which makes each embedding space diverse and compact. Further, a dynamic weight controller(DWC) is further designed for balancing the relative importance among them during training. The experimental results of our method are promising, which surpass previous state-of-the-art methods on several commonly used person re-ID benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recent large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has shown great potential in various downstream tasks via leveraging the pretrained vision and language knowledge. Scene text, which contains rich textual and visual information, has an inherent connection with a model like CLIP. Recently, pretraining approaches based on vision language models have made effective progresses in the field of text detection. In contrast to these works, this paper proposes a new method, termed TCM, focusing on Turning the CLIP Model directly for text detection without pretraining process. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed TCM as follows: (1) The underlying principle of our framework can be applied to improve existing scene text detector. (2) It facilitates the few-shot training capability of existing methods, e.g., by using 10% of labeled data, we significantly improve the performance of the baseline method with an average of 22% in terms of the F-measure on 4 benchmarks. (3) By turning the CLIP model into existing scene text detection methods, we further achieve promising domain adaptation ability. The code will be publicly released. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The sparse transformer can reduce the computational complexity of the self-attention layers to $O(n)$, whilst still being a universal approximator of continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. However, this permutation variant operation is not appropriate for direct application to sets. In this paper, we proposed an $O(n)$ complexity sampled transformer that can process point set elements directly without any additional inductive bias. Our sampled transformer introduces random element sampling, which randomly splits point sets into subsets, followed by applying a shared Hamiltonian self-attention mechanism to each subset. The overall attention mechanism can be viewed as a Hamiltonian cycle in the complete attention graph, and the permutation of point set elements is equivalent to randomly sampling Hamiltonian cycles. This mechanism implements a Monte Carlo simulation of the $O(n^2)$ dense attention connections. We show that it is a universal approximator for continuous set-to-set functions. Experimental results on point-clouds show comparable or better accuracy with significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the dense transformer or alternative sparse attention schemes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We create a reusable Transformer, BrainBERT, for intracranial recordings bringing modern representation learning approaches to neuroscience. Much like in NLP and speech recognition, this Transformer enables classifying complex concepts, i.e., decoding neural data, with higher accuracy and with much less data by being pretrained in an unsupervised manner on a large corpus of unannotated neural recordings. Our approach generalizes to new subjects with electrodes in new positions and to unrelated tasks showing that the representations robustly disentangle the neural signal. Just like in NLP where one can study language by investigating what a language model learns, this approach opens the door to investigating the brain by what a model of the brain learns. As a first step along this path, we demonstrate a new analysis of the intrinsic dimensionality of the computations in different areas of the brain. To construct these representations, we combine a technique for producing super-resolution spectrograms of neural data with an approach designed for generating contextual representations of audio by masking. In the future, far more concepts will be decodable from neural recordings by using representation learning, potentially unlocking the brain like language models unlocked language. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating realistic, high-quality and diverse images. However, the extent of controllability and editability with diffusion models is underexplored relative to GANs. Inspired by techniques based on the latent space of GAN models for image manipulation, we propose to train a diffusion model conditioned on two latent codes, a spatial content mask and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the progressive denoising process of diffusion models to encode pose/layout information in the spatial structure mask and semantic/style information in the style code. We extend the sampling technique from composable diffusion models to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs. This improves the quality of the generations significantly while also providing control over the amount of guidance from each latent code separately as well as from their joint distribution. To further enhance controllability, we vary the level of guidance for structure and style latents based on the denoising timestep. We observe more controllability compared to existing methods and show that without explicit training objectives, diffusion models can be leveraged for effective image manipulation, reference based image translation and style transfer. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning partial differential equations' (PDEs) solution operators is an essential problem in machine learning. However, there are several challenges for learning operators in practical applications like the irregular mesh, multiple input functions, and complexity of the PDEs' solution. To address these challenges, we propose a general neural operator transformer (GNOT), a scalable and effective transformer-based framework for learning operators. By designing a novel heterogeneous normalized attention layer, our model is highly flexible to handle multiple input functions and irregular mesh. Besides, we introduce a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems. The large model capacity of transformer architecture grants our model the possibility to scale to large datasets and practical problems. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets from different domains and achieve a remarkable improvement compared with alternative methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A fundamental question in neurolinguistics concerns the brain regions involved in syntactic and semantic processing during speech comprehension, both at the lexical (word processing) and supra-lexical levels (sentence and discourse processing). To what extent are these regions separated or intertwined? To address this question, we trained a lexical language model, Glove, and a supra-lexical language model, GPT-2, on a text corpus from which we selectively removed either syntactic or semantic information. We then assessed to what extent these information-restricted models were able to predict the time-courses of fMRI signal of humans listening to naturalistic text. We also manipulated the size of contextual information provided to GPT-2 in order to determine the windows of integration of brain regions involved in supra-lexical processing. Our analyses show that, while most brain regions involved in language are sensitive to both syntactic and semantic variables, the relative magnitudes of these effects vary a lot across these regions. Furthermore, we found an asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres, with semantic and syntactic processing being more dissociated in the left hemisphere than in the right, and the left and right hemispheres showing respectively greater sensitivity to short and long contexts. The use of information-restricted NLP models thus shed new light on the spatial organization of syntactic processing, semantic processing and compositionality. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Inspired by masked language modeling (MLM) in natural language processing, masked image modeling (MIM) has been recognized as a strong and popular self-supervised pre-training method in computer vision. However, its high random mask ratio would result in two serious problems: 1) the data are not efficiently exploited, which brings inefficient pre-training (\eg, 1600 epochs for MAE $vs.$ 300 epochs for the supervised), and 2) the high uncertainty and inconsistency of the pre-trained model, \ie, the prediction of the same patch may be inconsistent under different mask rounds. To tackle these problems, we propose efficient masked autoencoders with self-consistency (EMAE), to improve the pre-training efficiency and increase the consistency of MIM. In particular, we progressively divide the image into K non-overlapping parts, each of which is generated by a random mask and has the same mask ratio. Then the MIM task is conducted parallelly on all parts in an iteration and generates predictions. Besides, we design a self-consistency module to further maintain the consistency of predictions of overlapping masked patches among parts. Overall, the proposed method is able to exploit the data more efficiently and obtains reliable representations. Experiments on ImageNet show that EMAE achieves even higher results with only 300 pre-training epochs under ViT-Base than MAE (1600 epochs). EMAE also consistently obtains state-of-the-art transfer performance on various downstream tasks, like object detection, and semantic segmentation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Problems such as equipment defects or limited viewpoints will lead the captured point clouds to be incomplete. Therefore, recovering the complete point clouds from the partial ones plays an vital role in many practical tasks, and one of the keys lies in the prediction of the missing part. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud completion approach namely ProxyFormer that divides point clouds into existing (input) and missing (to be predicted) parts and each part communicates information through its proxies. Specifically, we fuse information into point proxy via feature and position extractor, and generate features for missing point proxies from the features of existing point proxies. Then, in order to better perceive the position of missing points, we design a missing part sensitive transformer, which converts random normal distribution into reasonable position information, and uses proxy alignment to refine the missing proxies. It makes the predicted point proxies more sensitive to the features and positions of the missing part, and thus make these proxies more suitable for subsequent coarse-to-fine processes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks on several benchmark datasets and has the fastest inference speed.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to expand an object detector for novel categories given only a few instances for training. However, detecting novel categories with only a few samples usually leads to the problem of misclassification. In FSOD, we notice the false positive (FP) of novel categories is prominent, in which the base categories are often recognized as novel ones. To address this issue, a novel data augmentation pipeline that Crops the Novel instances and Pastes them on the selected Base images, called CNPB, is proposed. There are two key questions to be answered: (1) How to select useful base images? and (2) How to combine novel and base data? We design a multi-step selection strategy to find useful base data. Specifically, we first discover the base images which contain the FP of novel categories and select a certain amount of samples from them for the base and novel categories balance. Then the bad cases, such as the base images that have unlabeled ground truth or easily confused base instances, are removed by using CLIP. Finally, the same category strategy is adopted, in which a novel instance with category n is pasted on the base image with the FP of n. During combination, a novel instance is cropped and randomly down-sized, and thus pasted at the assigned optimal location from the randomly generated candidates in a selected base image. Our method is simple yet effective and can be easy to plug into existing FSOD methods, demonstrating significant potential for use. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of our method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The training for deep neural networks (DNNs) demands immense energy consumption, which restricts the development of deep learning as well as increases carbon emissions. Thus, the study of energy-efficient training for DNNs is essential. In training, the linear layers consume the most energy because of the intense use of energy-consuming full-precision (FP32) multiplication in multiply-accumulate (MAC). The energy-efficient works try to decrease the precision of multiplication or replace the multiplication with energy-efficient operations such as addition or bitwise shift, to reduce the energy consumption of FP32 multiplications. However, the existing energy-efficient works cannot replace all of the FP32 multiplications during both forward and backward propagation with low-precision energy-efficient operations. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Layer-wise Scaling PoT Quantization (ALS-POTQ) method and a Multiplication-Free MAC (MF-MAC) to replace all of the FP32 multiplications with the INT4 additions and 1-bit XOR operations. In addition, we propose Weight Bias Correction and Parameterized Ratio Clipping techniques for stable training and improving accuracy. In our training scheme, all of the above methods do not introduce extra multiplications, so we reduce up to 95.8% of the energy consumption in linear layers during training. Experimentally, we achieve an accuracy degradation of less than 1% for CNN models on ImageNet and Transformer model on the WMT En-De task. In summary, we significantly outperform the existing methods for both energy efficiency and accuracy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The rise of video streaming applications has increased the demand for Video Quality Assessment (VQA). In 2016, Netflix introduced VMAF, a full reference VQA metric that strongly correlates with perceptual quality, but its computation is time-intensive. This paper proposes a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-energy-based VQA with texture information fusion (VQ-TIF ) model for video streaming applications that predicts VMAF for the reconstructed video compared to the original video. VQ-TIF extracts Structural Similarity (SSIM) and spatio-temporal features of the frames from the original and reconstructed videos, fuses them using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model to estimate VMAF. Experimental results show that VQ-TIF estimates VMAF with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.96 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.71, on average, compared to the ground truth VMAF scores. Additionally, VQ-TIF estimates VMAF at a rate of 9.14 times faster than the state-of-the-art VMAF implementation and a 89.44% reduction in the energy consumption, assuming an Ultra HD (2160p) display resolution. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-world vision based applications require fine-grained classification for various area of interest like e-commerce, mobile applications, warehouse management, etc. where reducing the severity of mistakes and improving the classification accuracy is of utmost importance. This paper proposes a method to boost fine-grained classification through a hierarchical approach via learnable independent query embeddings. This is achieved through a classification network that uses coarse class predictions to improve the fine class accuracy in a stage-wise sequential manner. We exploit the idea of hierarchy to learn query embeddings that are scalable across all levels, thus making this a relevant approach even for extreme classification where we have a large number of classes. The query is initialized with a weighted Eigen image calculated from training samples to best represent and capture the variance of the object. We introduce transformer blocks to fuse intermediate layers at which query attention happens to enhance the spatial representation of feature maps at different scales. This multi-scale fusion helps improve the accuracy of small-size objects. We propose a two-fold approach for the unique representation of learnable queries. First, at each hierarchical level, we leverage cluster based loss that ensures maximum separation between inter-class query embeddings and helps learn a better (query) representation in higher dimensional spaces. Second, we fuse coarse level queries with finer level queries weighted by a learned scale factor. We additionally introduce a novel block called Cross Attention on Multi-level queries with Prior (CAMP) Block that helps reduce error propagation from coarse level to finer level, which is a common problem in all hierarchical classifiers. Our method is able to outperform the existing methods with an improvement of ~11% at the fine-grained classification. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

With the ever-growing number of long documents, it is important to develop effective modeling methods that can process and analyze such texts. However, long texts pose important research challenges for existing text models, with more complex semantics and special characteristics. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances on long texts modeling based on Transformer models. Firstly, we introduce the formal definition of long text modeling. Then, as the core content, we discuss how to process long input to satisfy the length limitation and design improved Transformer architectures to effectively extend the maximum context length. Following this, we discuss how to adapt Transformer models to capture the special characteristics of long texts. Finally, we describe four typical applications involving long text modeling and conclude this paper with a discussion of future directions. Our survey intends to provide researchers with a synthesis and pointer to related work on long text modeling. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

In this paper, our objective is to evaluate the potential of diffusion probabilistic models for 3D human motion-related tasks. To this end, this paper presents a study of employing diffusion probabilistic models to predict future 3D human motion(s) from the previously observed motion. Based on the Human 3.6M and HumanEva-I datasets, our results show that diffusion probabilistic models are competitive for both single (deterministic) and multiple (stochastic) 3D motion prediction tasks, after finishing a single training process. In addition, we find out that diffusion probabilistic models can offer an attractive compromise, since they can strike the right balance between the likelihood and diversity of the predicted future motions.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Markov Decision Process (MDP) presents a mathematical framework to formulate the learning processes of agents in reinforcement learning. MDP is limited by the Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and action. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and actions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian environment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via temporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be similar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit to the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments. To resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from the history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a policy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation. Specifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy embeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion matrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the dispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can effectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse expression for the original policy embedding distribution. Experimental results show that this dispersion scheme can obtain more expressive diverse policies, which then derive more robust performance than recent learning baselines under various learning environments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We describe GEMBA, a GPT-based metric for assessment of translation quality, which works both with a reference translation and without. In our evaluation, we focus on zero-shot prompting, comparing four prompt variants in two modes, based on the availability of the reference. We investigate seven versions of GPT models, including ChatGPT. We show that our method for translation quality assessment only works with GPT 3.5 and larger models. Comparing to results from WMT22's Metrics shared task, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both modes when compared to MQM-based human labels. Our results are valid on the system level for all three WMT22 Metrics shared task language pairs, namely English into German, English into Russian, and Chinese into English. This provides a first glimpse into the usefulness of pre-trained, generative large language models for quality assessment of translations. We publicly release all our code and prompt templates used for the experiments described in this work, as well as all corresponding scoring results, to allow for external validation and reproducibility. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Requirements of large amounts of data is a difficulty in training many GANs. Data efficient GANs involve fitting a generators continuous target distribution with a limited discrete set of data samples, which is a difficult task. Single image methods have focused on modeling the internal distribution of a single image and generating its samples. While single image methods can synthesize image samples with diversity, they do not model multiple images or capture the inherent relationship possible between two images. Given only a handful of images, we are interested in generating samples and exploiting the commonalities in the input images. In this work, we extend the single-image GAN method to model multiple images for sample synthesis. We modify the discriminator with an auxiliary classifier branch, which helps to generate a wide variety of samples and to classify the input labels. Our Data-Efficient GAN (DEff-GAN) generates excellent results when similarities and correspondences can be drawn between the input images or classes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The unconditional convergence of the nonuniform difference scheme is proved rigorously in $L^2$ norm. Our main tool is the discrete complementary convolution kernels with respect to the coefficient kernels of the L1 type formula. The positive definiteness of the complementary convolution kernels is shown to be vital to the stability and convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this property is proved at the first time on the nonuniform time meshes. Two numerical experiments are presented to verify the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed numerical methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 2D-to-3D human pose lifting is fundamental for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proven inherently suitable to model the human skeletal topology. However, current GCN-based 3D HPE methods update the node features by aggregating their neighbors' information without considering the interaction of joints in different motion patterns. Although some studies import limb information to learn the movement patterns, the latent synergies among joints, such as maintaining balance in the motion are seldom investigated. We propose a hop-wise GraphFormer with intragroup joint refinement (HopFIR) to tackle the 3D HPE problem. The HopFIR mainly consists of a novel Hop-wise GraphFormer(HGF) module and an Intragroup Joint Refinement(IJR) module which leverages the prior limb information for peripheral joints refinement. The HGF module groups the joints by $k$-hop neighbors and utilizes a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism among these groups to discover latent joint synergy. Extensive experimental results show that HopFIR outperforms the SOTA methods with a large margin (on the Human3.6M dataset, the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) is 32.67mm). Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that previous SOTA GCN-based methods can benefit from the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism efficiently with significant performance promotion, such as SemGCN and MGCN are improved by 8.9% and 4.5%, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Architecting software-intensive systems can be a complex process. It deals with the daunting tasks of unifying stakeholders' perspectives, designers' intellect, tool-based automation, pattern-driven reuse, and so on, to sketch a blueprint that guides software implementation and evaluation. Despite its benefits, architecture-centric software engineering (ACSE) inherits a multitude of challenges. ACSE challenges could stem from a lack of standardized processes, socio-technical limitations, and scarcity of human expertise etc. that can impede the development of existing and emergent classes of software (e.g., IoTs, blockchain, quantum systems). Software Development Bots (DevBots) trained on large language models can help synergise architects' knowledge with artificially intelligent decision support to enable rapid architecting in a human-bot collaborative ACSE. An emerging solution to enable this collaboration is ChatGPT, a disruptive technology not primarily introduced for software engineering, but is capable of articulating and refining architectural artifacts based on natural language processing. We detail a case study that involves collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT for architectural analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of a services-driven software application. Preliminary results indicate that ChatGPT can mimic an architect's role to support and often lead ACSE, however; it requires human oversight and decision support for collaborative architecting. Future research focuses on harnessing empirical evidence about architects' productivity and exploring socio-technical aspects of architecting with ChatGPT to tackle emerging and futuristic challenges of ACSE. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This paper presents a data-driven approach to detect the functional interaction structure for software development teams from traces team members leave on development platforms during their daily work. Our approach considers differences in the activity levels of team members and uses a block-constrained configuration model to compute interaction preferences between members of different roles. We apply our approach in a case study to extract the functional interaction structure of a product team at the German IT security company genua GmbH. We subsequently validate the accuracy of the detected interaction structure in interviews with five team members. Finally, we show how our approach enables teams to compare their functional interaction structure against synthetically created benchmark scenarios. Specifically, we evaluate the level of knowledge diffusion in the team and identify areas where the team can further improve. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be applied in real time to manage a team's interaction structure. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Test-time adaptive (TTA) semantic segmentation adapts a source pre-trained image semantic segmentation model to unlabeled batches of target domain test images, different from real-world, where samples arrive one-by-one in an online fashion. To tackle online settings, we propose TransAdapt, a framework that uses transformer and input transformations to improve segmentation performance. Specifically, we pre-train a transformer-based module on a segmentation network that transforms unsupervised segmentation output to a more reliable supervised output, without requiring test-time online training. To also facilitate test-time adaptation, we propose an unsupervised loss based on the transformed input that enforces the model to be invariant and equivariant to photometric and geometric perturbations, respectively. Overall, our framework produces higher quality segmentation masks with up to 17.6% and 2.8% mIOU improvement over no-adaptation and competitive baselines, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

However, AES in Hindi and other low-resource languages remains unexplored. In this study, we reproduce and compare state-of-the-art methods for AES in the Hindi domain. We employ classical feature-based Machine Learning (ML) and advanced end-to-end models, including LSTM Networks and Fine-Tuned Transformer Architecture, in our approach and derive results comparable to those in the English language domain. Hindi being a low-resource language, lacks a dedicated essay-scoring corpus. We train and evaluate our models using translated English essays and empirically measure their performance on our own small-scale, real-world Hindi corpus. We follow this up with an in-depth analysis discussing prompt-specific behavior of different language models implemented. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The past decade has witnessed a drastic increase in modern deep neural networks (DNNs) size, especially for generative adversarial networks (GANs). Since GANs usually suffer from high computational complexity, researchers have shown an increased interest in applying pruning methods to reduce the training and inference costs of GANs. Among different pruning methods invented for supervised learning, dynamic sparse training (DST) has gained increasing attention recently as it enjoys excellent training efficiency with comparable performance to post-hoc pruning. Hence, applying DST on GANs, where we train a sparse GAN with a fixed parameter count throughout training, seems to be a good candidate for reducing GAN training costs. However, a few challenges, including the degrading training instability, emerge due to the adversarial nature of GANs. Hence, we introduce a quantity called balance ratio (BR) to quantify the balance of the generator and the discriminator. We conduct a series of experiments to show the importance of BR in understanding sparse GAN training. Building upon single dynamic sparse training (SDST), where only the generator is adjusted during training, we propose double dynamic sparse training (DDST) to control the BR during GAN training. Empirically, DDST automatically determines the density of the discriminator and greatly boosts the performance of sparse GANs on multiple datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain sensitive patient information, which presents privacy concerns when sharing such data. Synthetic data generation is a promising solution to mitigate these risks, often relying on deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models offer several advantages over GANs, such as generation of more realistic synthetic data and stable training in generating data modalities, including image, text, and sound. In this work, we investigate the potential of diffusion models for generating realistic mixed-type tabular EHRs, comparing TabDDPM model with existing methods on four datasets in terms of data quality, utility, privacy, and augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that TabDDPM outperforms the state-of-the-art models across all evaluation metrics, except for privacy, which confirms the trade-off between privacy and utility. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Medical anomalous data normally contains fine-grained instance-wise additive feature patterns (e.g. tumor, hemorrhage), that are oftenly critical but insignificant. Interestingly, apart from the remarkable image generation abilities of diffusion models, we observed that diffusion models can dissolve image details for a given image, resulting in generalized feature representations. We hereby propose DIA, dissolving is amplifying, that amplifies fine-grained image features by contrasting an image against its feature dissolved counterpart. In particular, we show that diffusion models can serve as semantic preserving feature dissolvers that help learning fine-grained anomalous patterns for anomaly detection tasks, especially for medical domains with fine-grained feature differences. As a result, our method yields a novel fine-grained anomaly detection method, aims at amplifying instance-level feature patterns, that significantly improves medical anomaly detection accuracy in a large margin without any prior knowledge of explicit fine-grained anomalous feature patterns. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-attention-based transformer models have achieved tremendous success in the domain of natural language processing. Despite their efficacy, accelerating the transformer is challenging due to its quadratic computational complexity and large activation sizes. Existing transformer accelerators attempt to prune its tokens to reduce memory access, albeit with high compute overheads. Moreover, previous works directly operate on large matrices involved in the attention operation, which limits hardware utilization. In order to address these challenges, this work proposes a novel dynamic inference scheme, DynaTran, which prunes activations at runtime with low overhead, substantially reducing the number of ineffectual operations. This improves the throughput of transformer inference. We further propose tiling the matrices in transformer operations along with diverse dataflows to improve data reuse, thus enabling higher energy efficiency. To effectively implement these methods, we propose AccelTran, a novel accelerator architecture for transformers. Extensive experiments with different models and benchmarks demonstrate that DynaTran achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art top-k hardware-aware pruning strategy while attaining up to 1.2$\times$ higher sparsity. One of our proposed accelerators, AccelTran-Edge, achieves 330K$\times$ higher throughput with 93K$\times$ lower energy requirement when compared to a Raspberry Pi device. On the other hand, AccelTran-Server achieves 5.73$\times$ higher throughput and 3.69$\times$ lower energy consumption compared to the state-of-the-art transformer co-processor, Energon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most existing image restoration methods use neural networks to learn strong image-level priors from huge data to estimate the lost information. However, these works still struggle in cases when images have severe information deficits. Introducing external priors or using reference images to provide information also have limitations in the application domain. In contrast, text input is more readily available and provides information with higher flexibility. In this work, we design an effective framework that allows the user to control the restoration process of degraded images with text descriptions. We use the text-image feature compatibility of the CLIP to alleviate the difficulty of fusing text and image features. Our framework can be used for various image restoration tasks, including image inpainting, image super-resolution, and image colorization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We formulate monocular depth estimation using denoising diffusion models, inspired by their recent successes in high fidelity image generation. To that end, we introduce innovations to address problems arising due to noisy, incomplete depth maps in training data, including step-unrolled denoising diffusion, an $L_1$ loss, and depth infilling during training. To cope with the limited availability of data for supervised training, we leverage pre-training on self-supervised image-to-image translation tasks. Despite the simplicity of the approach, with a generic loss and architecture, our DepthGen model achieves SOTA performance on the indoor NYU dataset, and near SOTA results on the outdoor KITTI dataset. Further, with a multimodal posterior, DepthGen naturally represents depth ambiguity (e.g., from transparent surfaces), and its zero-shot performance combined with depth imputation, enable a simple but effective text-to-3D pipeline.

We provide a new information theoretic perspective for understanding the ERG through the intermediary of Bayesian Statistical Inference. This connection is facilitated by the Dynamical Bayesian Inference scheme, which encodes Bayesian inference in the form of a one parameter family of probability distributions solving an integro-differential equation derived from Bayes' law. In this note, we demonstrate how the Dynamical Bayesian Inference equation is, itself, equivalent to a diffusion equation which we dub Bayesian Diffusion.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We improve on the popular conformer architecture by replacing the depthwise temporal convolutions with diagonal state space (DSS) models. DSS is a recently introduced variant of linear RNNs obtained by discretizing a linear dynamical system with a diagonal state transition matrix. DSS layers project the input sequence onto a space of orthogonal polynomials where the choice of basis functions, metric and support is controlled by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. We compare neural transducers with either conformer or our proposed DSS-augmented transformer (DSSformer) encoders on three public corpora: Switchboard English conversational telephone speech 300 hours, Switchboard+Fisher 2000 hours, and a spoken archive of holocaust survivor testimonials called MALACH 176 hours. On Switchboard 300/2000 hours, we reach a single model performance of 8.9%/6.7% WER on the combined test set of the Hub5 2000 evaluation, respectively, and on MALACH we improve the WER by 7% relative over the previous best published result. In addition, we present empirical evidence suggesting that DSS layers learn damped Fourier basis functions where the attenuation coefficients are layer specific whereas the frequency coefficients converge to almost identical linearly-spaced values across all layers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Predicting the Stock movement attracts much attention from both industry and academia. Despite such significant efforts, the results remain unsatisfactory due to the inherently complicated nature of the stock market driven by factors including supply and demand, the state of the economy, the political climate, and even irrational human behavior. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been extended for time series data; however, robust methods are primarily for synthetic series generation, which fall short for appropriate stock prediction. This is because existing GANs for stock applications suffer from mode collapse and only consider one-step prediction, thus underutilizing the potential of GAN. Furthermore, merging news and market volatility are neglected in current GANs. To address these issues, we exploit expert domain knowledge in finance and, for the first time, attempt to formulate stock movement prediction into a Wasserstein GAN framework for multi-step prediction. We propose IndexGAN, which includes deliberate designs for the inherent characteristics of the stock market, leverages news context learning to thoroughly investigate textual information and develop an attentive seq2seq learning network that captures the temporal dependency among stock prices, news, and market sentiment. We also utilize the critic to approximate the Wasserstein distance between actual and predicted sequences and develop a rolling strategy for deployment that mitigates noise from the financial market. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world broad-based indices, demonstrating the superior performance of our architecture over other state-of-the-art baselines, also validating all its contributing components. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image based Deep Feature Quality Metrics (DFQMs) have been shown to better correlate with subjective perceptual scores over traditional metrics. The fundamental focus of these DFQMs is to exploit internal representations from a large scale classification network as the metric feature space. Previously, no attention has been given to the problem of identifying which layers are most perceptually relevant. In this paper we present a new method for selecting perceptually relevant layers from such a network, based on a neuroscience interpretation of layer behaviour. The selected layers are treated as a hyperparameter to the critic network in a W-GAN. The critic uses the output from these layers in the preliminary stages to extract perceptual information. A video enhancement network is trained adversarially with this critic. Our results show that the introduction of these selected features into the critic yields up to 10% (FID) and 15% (KID) performance increase against other critic networks that do not exploit the idea of optimised feature selection. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Paralinguistic speech processing is important in addressing many issues, such as sentiment and neurocognitive disorder analyses. Recently, Transformer has achieved remarkable success in the natural language processing field and has demonstrated its adaptation to speech. However, previous works on Transformer in the speech field have not incorporated the properties of speech, leaving the full potential of Transformer unexplored. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of speech and propose a general structure-based framework, called SpeechFormer++, for paralinguistic speech processing. More concretely, following the component relationship in the speech signal, we design a unit encoder to model the intra- and inter-unit information (i.e., frames, phones, and words) efficiently. According to the hierarchical relationship, we utilize merging blocks to generate features at different granularities, which is consistent with the structural pattern in the speech signal. Moreover, a word encoder is introduced to integrate word-grained features into each unit encoder, which effectively balances fine-grained and coarse-grained information. SpeechFormer++ is evaluated on the speech emotion recognition (IEMOCAP &amp; MELD), depression classification (DAIC-WOZ) and Alzheimer's disease detection (Pitt) tasks. The results show that SpeechFormer++ outperforms the standard Transformer while greatly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, it delivers superior results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, score-based generative models have been successfully employed for the task of speech enhancement. A stochastic differential equation is used to model the iterative forward process, where at each step environmental noise and white Gaussian noise are added to the clean speech signal. While in limit the mean of the forward process ends at the noisy mixture, in practice it stops earlier and thus only at an approximation of the noisy mixture. This results in a discrepancy between the terminating distribution of the forward process and the prior used for solving the reverse process at inference. In this paper, we address this discrepancy. To this end, we propose a forward process based on a Brownian bridge and show that such a process leads to a reduction of the mismatch compared to previous diffusion processes. More importantly, we show that our approach improves in objective metrics over the baseline process with only half of the iteration steps and having one hyperparameter less to tune. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
