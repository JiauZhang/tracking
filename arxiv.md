### [Can Offline Reinforcement Learning Help Natural Language Understanding?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03864)
Pre-training has been a useful method for learning implicit transferable knowledge and it shows the benefit of offering complementary features across different modalities. Recent work mainly focuses on the modalities such as image and text, for example, studies show that visual features learned from images can help visual-grounded language understanding. In this paper, we consider investigating the potential connection between offline reinforcement learning (RL) and language modeling (LM). Intuitively, RL and LM are similar in predicting the next states based on the current and previous states, which rely on both local and long-range dependency across states. To validate such an assumption, we pre-trained different offline RL tasks using Transformer and then evaluate these models on various language-related tasks. Experimental results show that our RL pre-trained models can give close performance compared with the models using the LM training objective, showing that there exist common useful features across these two modalities. To further explore the potential relationship, we investigate some factors such as Markov property and the sequential nature of RL trajectory. 

### [Analysis of Drug repurposing Knowledge graphs for Covid-19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03911)
Knowledge graph (KG) is used to represent data in terms of entities and structural relations between the entities. This representation can be used to solve complex problems such as recommendation systems and question answering. In this study, a set of candidate drugs for COVID-19 are proposed by using Drug repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG). DRKG is a biological knowledge graph constructed using a vast amount of open source biomedical knowledge to understand the mechanism of compounds and the related biological functions. Node and relation embeddings are learned using knowledge graph embedding models and neural network and attention related models. Different models are used to get the node embedding by changing the objective of the model. These embeddings are later used to predict if a candidate drug is effective to treat a disease or how likely it is for a drug to bind to a protein associated to a disease which can be modelled as a link prediction task between two nodes. RESCAL performed the best on the test dataset in terms of MR, MRR and Hits@3. 

### [CODEBench: A Neural Architecture and Hardware Accelerator Co-Design  Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03965)
Recently, automated co-design of machine learning (ML) models and accelerator architectures has attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia. However, most co-design frameworks either explore a limited search space or employ suboptimal exploration techniques for simultaneous design decision investigations of the ML model and the accelerator. Furthermore, training the ML model and simulating the accelerator performance is computationally expensive. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel neural architecture and hardware accelerator co-design framework, called CODEBench. It is composed of two new benchmarking sub-frameworks, CNNBench and AccelBench, which explore expanded design spaces of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNN accelerators. CNNBench leverages an advanced search technique, BOSHNAS, to efficiently train a neural heteroscedastic surrogate model to converge to an optimal CNN architecture by employing second-order gradients. AccelBench performs cycle-accurate simulations for a diverse set of accelerator architectures in a vast design space. With the proposed co-design method, called BOSHCODE, our best CNN-accelerator pair achieves 1.4% higher accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the state-of-the-art pair, while enabling 59.1% lower latency and 60.8% lower energy consumption. On the ImageNet dataset, it achieves 3.7% higher Top1 accuracy at 43.8% lower latency and 11.2% lower energy consumption. CODEBench outperforms the state-of-the-art framework, i.e., Auto-NBA, by achieving 1.5% higher accuracy and 34.7x higher throughput, while enabling 11.0x lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 4.0x lower chip area on CIFAR-10. 

### [Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation with Cycle-resemblance Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03967)
Recently, due to the increasing requirements of medical imaging applications and the professional requirements of annotating medical images, few-shot learning has gained increasing attention in the medical image semantic segmentation field. To perform segmentation with limited number of labeled medical images, most existing studies use Proto-typical Networks (PN) and have obtained compelling success. However, these approaches overlook the query image features extracted from the proposed representation network, failing to preserving the spatial connection between query and support images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised few-shot medical image segmentation network and introduce a novel Cycle-Resemblance Attention (CRA) module to fully leverage the pixel-wise relation between query and support medical images. Notably, we first line up multiple attention blocks to refine more abundant relation information. Then, we present CRAPNet by integrating the CRA module with a classic prototype network, where pixel-wise relations between query and support features are well recaptured for segmentation. Extensive experiments on two different medical image datasets, e.g., abdomen MRI and abdomen CT, demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art methods. 

### [Multimodal Vision Transformers with Forced Attention for Behavior  Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03968)
Human behavior understanding requires looking at minute details in the large context of a scene containing multiple input modalities. It is necessary as it allows the design of more human-like machines. While transformer approaches have shown great improvements, they face multiple challenges such as lack of data or background noise. To tackle these, we introduce the Forced Attention (FAt) Transformer which utilize forced attention with a modified backbone for input encoding and a use of additional inputs. In addition to improving the performance on different tasks and inputs, the modification requires less time and memory resources. We provide a model for a generalised feature extraction for tasks concerning social signals and behavior analysis. Our focus is on understanding behavior in videos where people are interacting with each other or talking into the camera which simulates the first person point of view in social interaction. FAt Transformers are applied to two downstream tasks: personality recognition and body language recognition. We achieve state-of-the-art results for Udiva v0.5, First Impressions v2 and MPII Group Interaction datasets. We further provide an extensive ablation study of the proposed architecture. 

### [Unsupervised Deep Learning for AC Optimal Power Flow via Lagrangian  Duality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03977)
Non-convex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) is a fundamental optimization problem in power system analysis. The computational complexity of conventional solvers is typically high and not suitable for large-scale networks in real-time operation. Hence, deep learning based approaches have gained intensive attention to conduct the time-consuming training process offline. Supervised learning methods may yield a feasible AC-OPF solution with a small optimality gap. However, they often need conventional solvers to generate the training dataset. This paper proposes an end-to-end unsupervised learning based framework for AC-OPF. We develop a deep neural network to output a partial set of decision variables while the remaining variables are recovered by solving AC power flow equations. The fast decoupled power flow solver is adopted to further reduce the computational time. In addition, we propose using a modified augmented Lagrangian function as the training loss. The multipliers are adjusted dynamically based on the degree of constraint violation. Extensive numerical test results corroborate the advantages of our proposed approach over some existing methods. 

### [TweetDrought: A Deep-Learning Drought Impacts Recognizer based on  Twitter Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04001)
Acquiring a better understanding of drought impacts becomes increasingly vital under a warming climate. Traditional drought indices describe mainly biophysical variables and not impacts on social, economic, and environmental systems. We utilized natural language processing and bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers (BERT) based transfer learning to fine-tune the model on the data from the news-based Drought Impact Report (DIR) and then apply it to recognize seven types of drought impacts based on the filtered Twitter data from the United States. Our model achieved a satisfying macro-F1 score of 0.89 on the DIR test set. The model was then applied to California tweets and validated with keyword-based labels. The macro-F1 score was 0.58. However, due to the limitation of keywords, we also spot-checked tweets with controversial labels. 83.5% of BERT labels were correct compared to the keyword labels. Overall, the fine-tuned BERT-based recognizer provided proper predictions and valuable information on drought impacts. The interpretation and analysis of the model were consistent with experiential domain expertise. 

### [RLSEP: Learning Label Ranks for Multi-label Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04022)
Multi-label ranking maps instances to a ranked set of predicted labels from multiple possible classes. The ranking approach for multi-label learning problems received attention for its success in multi-label classification, with one of the well-known approaches being pairwise label ranking. However, most existing methods assume that only partial information about the preference relation is known, which is inferred from the partition of labels into a positive and negative set, then treat labels with equal importance. In this paper, we focus on the unique challenge of ranking when the order of the true label set is provided. We propose a novel dedicated loss function to optimize models by incorporating penalties for incorrectly ranked pairs, and make use of the ranking information present in the input. Our method achieves the best reported performance measures on both synthetic and real world ranked datasets and shows improvements on overall ranking of labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is generalizable to a variety of multi-label classification and ranking tasks, while revealing a calibration towards a certain ranking ordering. 

### [Executing your Commands via Motion Diffusion in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04048)
We study a challenging task, conditional human motion generation, which produces plausible human motion sequences according to various conditional inputs, such as action classes or textual descriptors. Since human motions are highly diverse and have a property of quite different distribution from conditional modalities, such as textual descriptors in natural languages, it is hard to learn a probabilistic mapping from the desired conditional modality to the human motion sequences. Besides, the raw motion data from the motion capture system might be redundant in sequences and contain noises; directly modeling the joint distribution over the raw motion sequences and conditional modalities would need a heavy computational overhead and might result in artifacts introduced by the captured noises. To learn a better representation of the various human motion sequences, we first design a powerful Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and arrive at a representative and low-dimensional latent code for a human motion sequence. Then, instead of using a diffusion model to establish the connections between the raw motion sequences and the conditional inputs, we perform a diffusion process on the motion latent space. Our proposed Motion Latent-based Diffusion model (MLD) could produce vivid motion sequences conforming to the given conditional inputs and substantially reduce the computational overhead in both the training and inference stages. Extensive experiments on various human motion generation tasks demonstrate that our MLD achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods among extensive human motion generation tasks, with two orders of magnitude faster than previous diffusion models on raw motion sequences. 

### [Learning to Dub Movies via Hierarchical Prosody Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04054)
Given a piece of text, a video clip and a reference audio, the movie dubbing (also known as visual voice clone V2C) task aims to generate speeches that match the speaker's emotion presented in the video using the desired speaker voice as reference. V2C is more challenging than conventional text-to-speech tasks as it additionally requires the generated speech to exactly match the varying emotions and speaking speed presented in the video. Unlike previous works, we propose a novel movie dubbing architecture to tackle these problems via hierarchical prosody modelling, which bridges the visual information to corresponding speech prosody from three aspects: lip, face, and scene. Specifically, we align lip movement to the speech duration, and convey facial expression to speech energy and pitch via attention mechanism based on valence and arousal representations inspired by recent psychology findings. Moreover, we design an emotion booster to capture the atmosphere from global video scenes. All these embeddings together are used to generate mel-spectrogram and then convert to speech waves via existing vocoder. Extensive experimental results on the Chem and V2C benchmark datasets demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed method. The source code and trained models will be released to the public. 

### [A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-hop Machine Reading Comprehension  Datasets and Metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04070)
Multi-hop Machine reading comprehension is a challenging task with aim of answering a question based on disjoint pieces of information across the different passages. The evaluation metrics and datasets are a vital part of multi-hop MRC because it is not possible to train and evaluate models without them, also, the proposed challenges by datasets often are an important motivation for improving the existing models. Due to increasing attention to this field, it is necessary and worth reviewing them in detail. This study aims to present a comprehensive survey on recent advances in multi-hop MRC evaluation metrics and datasets. In this regard, first, the multi-hop MRC problem definition will be presented, then the evaluation metrics based on their multi-hop aspect will be investigated. Also, 15 multi-hop datasets have been reviewed in detail from 2017 to 2022, and a comprehensive analysis has been prepared at the end. Finally, open issues in this field have been discussed. 

### [Federated Learning for Inference at Anytime and Anywhere](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04084)
Federated learning has been predominantly concerned with collaborative training of deep networks from scratch, and especially the many challenges that arise, such as communication cost, robustness to heterogeneous data, and support for diverse device capabilities. However, there is no unified framework that addresses all these problems together. This paper studies the challenges and opportunities of exploiting pre-trained Transformer models in FL. In particular, we propose to efficiently adapt such pre-trained models by injecting a novel attention-based adapter module at each transformer block that both modulates the forward pass and makes an early prediction. Training only the lightweight adapter by FL leads to fast and communication-efficient learning even in the presence of heterogeneous data and devices. Extensive experiments on standard FL benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, FEMNIST and SpeechCommandsv2 demonstrate that this simple framework provides fast and accurate FL while supporting heterogenous device capabilities, efficient personalization, and scalable-cost anytime inference. 

### [Frozen CLIP Model is Efficient Point Cloud Backbone](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04098)
The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has demonstrated great success in NLP and 2D image fields because of the high-quality representation ability and transferability of their pretrained models. However, pretraining such a strong model is difficult in the 3D point cloud field since the training data is limited and point cloud collection is expensive. This paper introduces \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{P}oint \textbf{C}loud \textbf{L}earning (EPCL), an effective and efficient point cloud learner for directly training high-quality point cloud models with a frozen CLIP model. Our EPCL connects the 2D and 3D modalities by semantically aligning the 2D features and point cloud features without paired 2D-3D data. Specifically, the input point cloud is divided into a sequence of tokens and directly fed into the frozen CLIP model to learn point cloud representation. Furthermore, we design a task token to narrow the gap between 2D images and 3D point clouds. Comprehensive experiments on 3D detection, semantic segmentation, classification and few-shot learning demonstrate that the 2D CLIP model can be an efficient point cloud backbone and our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both real-world and synthetic downstream tasks. Code will be available. 

### [All-to-key Attention for Arbitrary Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04105)
Attention-based arbitrary style transfer studies have shown promising performance in synthesizing vivid local style details. They typically use the all-to-all attention mechanism: each position of content features is fully matched to all positions of style features. However, all-to-all attention tends to generate distorted style patterns and has quadratic complexity. It virtually limits both the effectiveness and efficiency of arbitrary style transfer. In this paper, we rethink what kind of attention mechanism is more appropriate for arbitrary style transfer. Our answer is a novel all-to-key attention mechanism: each position of content features is matched to key positions of style features. Specifically, it integrates two newly proposed attention forms: distributed and progressive attention. Distributed attention assigns attention to multiple key positions; Progressive attention pays attention from coarse to fine. All-to-key attention promotes the matching of diverse and reasonable style patterns and has linear complexity. The resultant module, dubbed StyA2K, has fine properties in rendering reasonable style textures and maintaining consistent local structure. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior results than state-of-the-art approaches. 

### [Group Generalized Mean Pooling for Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04114)
Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts the final representation from either class token or an average of all patch tokens, following the architecture of Transformer in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. However, studies for the best way of aggregating the patch tokens are still limited to average pooling, while widely-used pooling strategies, such as max and GeM pooling, can be considered. Despite their effectiveness, the existing pooling strategies do not consider the architecture of ViT and the channel-wise difference in the activation maps, aggregating the crucial and trivial channels with the same importance. In this paper, we present Group Generalized Mean (GGeM) pooling as a simple yet powerful pooling strategy for ViT. GGeM divides the channels into groups and computes GeM pooling with a shared pooling parameter per group. As ViT groups the channels via a multi-head attention mechanism, grouping the channels by GGeM leads to lower head-wise dependence while amplifying important channels on the activation maps. Exploiting GGeM shows 0.1%p to 0.7%p performance boosts compared to the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance for ViT-Base and ViT-Large models in ImageNet-1K classification task. Moreover, GGeM outperforms the existing pooling strategies on image retrieval and multi-modal representation learning tasks, demonstrating the superiority of GGeM for a variety of tasks. GGeM is a simple algorithm in that only a few lines of code are necessary for implementation. 

### [DialogCC: Large-Scale Multi-Modal Dialogue Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04119)
As sharing images in an instant message is a crucial factor, there has been active research on learning a image-text multi-modal dialogue model. However, training a well-generalized multi-modal dialogue model is challenging because existing multi-modal dialogue datasets contain a small number of data, limited topics, and a restricted variety of images per dialogue. In this paper, we present a multi-modal dialogue dataset creation pipeline that involves matching large-scale images to dialogues based on CLIP similarity. Using this automatic pipeline, we propose a large-scale multi-modal dialogue dataset, DialogCC, which covers diverse real-world topics and various images per dialogue. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training a multi-modal dialogue model with our dataset can improve generalization performance. Additionally, existing models trained with our dataset achieve state-of-the-art performance on image and text retrieval tasks. The source code and the dataset will be released after publication. 

### [Denoising Self-attentive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04120)
Transformer-based sequential recommenders are very powerful for capturing both short-term and long-term sequential item dependencies. This is mainly attributed to their unique self-attention networks to exploit pairwise item-item interactions within the sequence. However, real-world item sequences are often noisy, which is particularly true for implicit feedback. For example, a large portion of clicks do not align well with user preferences, and many products end up with negative reviews or being returned. As such, the current user action only depends on a subset of items, not on the entire sequences. Many existing Transformer-based models use full attention distributions, which inevitably assign certain credits to irrelevant items. This may lead to sub-optimal performance if Transformers are not regularized properly. 

### [Complete Solution for Vehicle Re-ID in Surround-view Camera System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04126)
Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a critical component of the autonomous driving perception system, and research in this area has accelerated in recent years. However, there is yet no perfect solution to the vehicle re-identification issue associated with the car's surround-view camera system. Our analysis identifies two significant issues in the aforementioned scenario: i) It is difficult to identify the same vehicle in many picture frames due to the unique construction of the fisheye camera. ii) The appearance of the same vehicle when seen via the surround vision system's several cameras is rather different. To overcome these issues, we suggest an integrative vehicle Re-ID solution method. On the one hand, we provide a technique for determining the consistency of the tracking box drift with respect to the target. On the other hand, we combine a Re-ID network based on the attention mechanism with spatial limitations to increase performance in situations involving multiple cameras. Finally, our approach combines state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time performance. We will soon make the source code and annotated fisheye dataset available. 

### [NRTR: Neuron Reconstruction with Transformer from 3D Optical Microscopy  Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04163)
The neuron reconstruction from raw Optical Microscopy (OM) image stacks is the basis of neuroscience. Manual annotation and semi-automatic neuron tracing algorithms are time-consuming and inefficient. Existing deep learning neuron reconstruction methods, although demonstrating exemplary performance, greatly demand complex rule-based components. Therefore, a crucial challenge is designing an end-to-end neuron reconstruction method that makes the overall framework simpler and model training easier. We propose a Neuron Reconstruction Transformer (NRTR) that, discarding the complex rule-based components, views neuron reconstruction as a direct set-prediction problem. To the best of our knowledge, NRTR is the first image-to-set deep learning model for end-to-end neuron reconstruction. In experiments using the BigNeuron and VISoR-40 datasets, NRTR achieves excellent neuron reconstruction results for comprehensive benchmarks and outperforms competitive baselines. Results of extensive experiments indicate that NRTR is effective at showing that neuron reconstruction is viewed as a set-prediction problem, which makes end-to-end model training available. 

### [GreenEyes: An Air Quality Evaluating Model based on WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04175)
Accompanying rapid industrialization, humans are suffering from serious air pollution problems. The demand for air quality prediction is becoming more and more important to the government's policy-making and people's daily life. In this paper, We propose GreenEyes -- a deep neural network model, which consists of a WaveNet-based backbone block for learning representations of sequences and an LSTM with a Temporal Attention module for capturing the hidden interactions between features of multi-channel inputs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we carry out several experiments including an ablation study on our collected and preprocessed air quality data near HKUST. The experimental results show our model can effectively predict the air quality level of the next timestamp given any segment of the air quality data from the data set. We have also released our standalone dataset at https://github.com/AI-Huang/IAQI_Dataset The model and code for this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/AI-Huang/AirEvaluation 

### [Bundling Impacts in Spanish Telecommunications Market](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04189)
Bundling is a pervasive strategy in telecommunications markets. Due to the great success obtained at Spanish Telco market, this article analyzes the impacts of the introduction of convergent bundling on that market. This commercial strategy has caused major changes in the market, both from the point of view of demand and its own structure. From the demand-side, we analyze how product bundling has produced a substantial reduction on effective prices in the sector, and by means of technological diffusion models, we show that bundling is the main factor of Fixed Broadband development, along with FTTH networks deployments, in contrast with stand-alone product marketing scenarios. Pay TV inclusion and hard-bundling strategies at communications packages has motivated the greatest growth of this product in the history of this market. Regarding market structure, the introduction of convergent bundling has led to a consolidation in the market, increasing the concentration around the main convergent players 

### [Learning Domain Invariant Prompt for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04196)
Prompt learning is one of the most effective and trending ways to adapt powerful vision-language foundation models like CLIP to downstream datasets by tuning learnable prompt vectors with very few samples. However, although prompt learning achieves excellent performance over in-domain data, it still faces the major challenge of generalizing to unseen classes and domains. Some existing prompt learning methods tackle this issue by adaptively generating different prompts for different tokens or domains but neglecting the ability of learned prompts to generalize to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning paradigm that directly generates domain invariant prompt generalizable to unseen domains, called MetaPrompt. Specifically, a dual-modality prompt tuning network is proposed to generate prompts for inputs from both image and text modalities. More importantly, we propose a meta-learning-based prompt tuning algorithm that explicitly constrains the prompt tuned on a specific domain or class also to achieve good performance on another domain or class. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets for base-to-new generalization and four datasets for domain generalization demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods. 

### [Harnessing the Power of Multi-Task Pretraining for Ground-Truth Level  Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04231)
Natural language explanations promise to offer intuitively understandable explanations of a neural network's decision process in complex vision-language tasks, as pursued in recent VL-NLE models. While current models offer impressive performance on task accuracy and explanation plausibility, they suffer from a range of issues: Some models feature a modular design where the explanation generation module is poorly integrated with a separate module for task-answer prediction, employ backbone models trained on limited sets of tasks, or incorporate ad hoc solutions to increase performance on single datasets. We propose to evade these limitations by applying recent advances in large-scale multi-task pretraining of generative Transformer models to the problem of VL-NLE tasks. Our approach outperforms recent models by a large margin, with human annotators preferring the generated explanations over the ground truth in two out of three evaluated datasets. As a novel challenge in VL-NLE research, we propose the problem of multi-task VL-NLE and show that jointly training on multiple tasks can increase the explanation quality. We discuss the ethical implications of high-quality NLE generation and other issues in recent VL-NLE research. 

### [ViTPose+: Vision Transformer Foundation Model for Generic Body Pose  Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04246)
In this paper, we show the surprisingly good properties of plain vision transformers for body pose estimation from various aspects, namely simplicity in model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training paradigm, and transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple baseline model dubbed ViTPose. Specifically, ViTPose employs the plain and non-hierarchical vision transformer as an encoder to encode features and a lightweight decoder to decode body keypoints in either a top-down or a bottom-up manner. It can be scaled up from about 20M to 1B parameters by taking advantage of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of the vision transformer, setting a new Pareto front for throughput and performance. Besides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input resolution, and pre-training and fine-tuning strategy. Based on the flexibility, a novel ViTPose+ model is proposed to deal with heterogeneous body keypoint categories in different types of body pose estimation tasks via knowledge factorization, i.e., adopting task-agnostic and task-specific feed-forward networks in the transformer. We also empirically demonstrate that the knowledge of large ViTPose models can be easily transferred to small ones via a simple knowledge token. Experimental results show that our ViTPose model outperforms representative methods on the challenging MS COCO Human Keypoint Detection benchmark at both top-down and bottom-up settings. Furthermore, our ViTPose+ model achieves state-of-the-art performance simultaneously on a series of body pose estimation tasks, including MS COCO, AI Challenger, OCHuman, MPII for human keypoint detection, COCO-Wholebody for whole-body keypoint detection, as well as AP-10K and APT-36K for animal keypoint detection, without sacrificing inference speed. 

### [Talking Head Generation with Probabilistic Audio-to-Visual Diffusion  Priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04248)
In this paper, we introduce a simple and novel framework for one-shot audio-driven talking head generation. Unlike prior works that require additional driving sources for controlled synthesis in a deterministic manner, we instead probabilistically sample all the holistic lip-irrelevant facial motions (i.e. pose, expression, blink, gaze, etc.) to semantically match the input audio while still maintaining both the photo-realism of audio-lip synchronization and the overall naturalness. This is achieved by our newly proposed audio-to-visual diffusion prior trained on top of the mapping between audio and disentangled non-lip facial representations. Thanks to the probabilistic nature of the diffusion prior, one big advantage of our framework is it can synthesize diverse facial motion sequences given the same audio clip, which is quite user-friendly for many real applications. Through comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, we conclude that (1) our diffusion prior outperforms auto-regressive prior significantly on almost all the concerned metrics; (2) our overall system is competitive with prior works in terms of audio-lip synchronization but can effectively sample rich and natural-looking lip-irrelevant facial motions while still semantically harmonized with the audio input. 

### [Approximations in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04297)
The design and implementation of Deep Learning (DL) models is currently receiving a lot of attention from both industrials and academics. However, the computational workload associated with DL is often out of reach for low-power embedded devices and is still costly when run on datacenters. By relaxing the need for fully precise operations, Approximate Computing (AxC) substantially improves performance and energy efficiency. DL is extremely relevant in this context, since playing with the accuracy needed to do adequate computations will significantly enhance performance, while keeping the quality of results in a user-constrained range. This chapter will explore how AxC can improve the performance and energy efficiency of hardware accelerators in DL applications during inference and training. 

### [Interactive Visualization on Large High-Resolution Displays: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04346)
In the past few years, large high-resolution displays (LHRDs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers, industries, and application areas that increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making. An up-to-date survey on the use of LHRDs for interactive data visualization seems warranted to summarize how new solutions meet the characteristics and requirements of LHRDs and take advantage of their unique benefits. In this survey, we start by defining LHRDs and outlining the consequence of LHRD environments on interactive visualizations in terms of more pixels, space, users, and devices. Then, we review related literature along the four axes of visualization, interaction, evaluation studies, and applications. With these four axes, our survey provides a unique perspective and covers a broad range of aspects being relevant when developing interactive visual data analysis solutions for LHRDs. We conclude this survey by reflecting on a number of opportunities for future research to help the community take up the still open challenges of interactive visualization on LHRDs. 

### [A Fine-grained Chinese Software Privacy Policy Dataset for Sequence  Labeling and Regulation Compliant Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04357)
Privacy protection raises great attention on both legal levels and user awareness. To protect user privacy, countries enact laws and regulations requiring software privacy policies to regulate their behavior. However, privacy policies are written in natural languages with many legal terms and software jargon that prevent users from understanding and even reading them. It is desirable to use NLP techniques to analyze privacy policies for helping users understand them. Furthermore, existing datasets ignore law requirements and are limited to English. In this paper, we construct the first Chinese privacy policy dataset, namely CA4P-483, to facilitate the sequence labeling tasks and regulation compliance identification between privacy policies and software. Our dataset includes 483 Chinese Android application privacy policies, over 11K sentences, and 52K fine-grained annotations. We evaluate families of robust and representative baseline models on our dataset. Based on baseline performance, we provide findings and potential research directions on our dataset. Finally, we investigate the potential applications of CA4P-483 combing regulation requirements and program analysis. 

### [MIME: Human-Aware 3D Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04360)
Generating realistic 3D worlds occupied by moving humans has many applications in games, architecture, and synthetic data creation. But generating such scenes is expensive and labor intensive. Recent work generates human poses and motions given a 3D scene. Here, we take the opposite approach and generate 3D indoor scenes given 3D human motion. Such motions can come from archival motion capture or from IMU sensors worn on the body, effectively turning human movement in a "scanner" of the 3D world. Intuitively, human movement indicates the free-space in a room and human contact indicates surfaces or objects that support activities such as sitting, lying or touching. We propose MIME (Mining Interaction and Movement to infer 3D Environments), which is a generative model of indoor scenes that produces furniture layouts that are consistent with the human movement. MIME uses an auto-regressive transformer architecture that takes the already generated objects in the scene as well as the human motion as input, and outputs the next plausible object. To train MIME, we build a dataset by populating the 3D FRONT scene dataset with 3D humans. Our experiments show that MIME produces more diverse and plausible 3D scenes than a recent generative scene method that does not know about human movement. Code and data will be available for research at https://mime.is.tue.mpg.de. 

### [CiaoSR: Continuous Implicit Attention-in-Attention Network for  Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04362)
Learning continuous image representations is recently gaining popularity for image super-resolution (SR) because of its ability to reconstruct high-resolution images with arbitrary scales from low-resolution inputs. Existing methods mostly ensemble nearby features to predict the new pixel at any queried coordinate in the SR image. Such a local ensemble suffers from some limitations: i) it has no learnable parameters and it neglects the similarity of the visual features; ii) it has a limited receptive field and cannot ensemble relevant features in a large field which are important in an image; iii) it inherently has a gap with real camera imaging since it only depends on the coordinate. To address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous implicit attention-in-attention network, called CiaoSR. We explicitly design an implicit attention network to learn the ensemble weights for the nearby local features. Furthermore, we embed a scale-aware attention in this implicit attention network to exploit additional non-local information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CiaoSR significantly outperforms the existing single image super resolution (SISR) methods with the same backbone. In addition, the proposed method also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the arbitrary-scale SR task. The effectiveness of the method is also demonstrated on the real-world SR setting. More importantly, CiaoSR can be flexibly integrated into any backbone to improve the SR performance. 

### [Models Developed for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04377)
Emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) has raised enormous attention towards artificial neural networks (ANNs) once again. They have become the state-of-the-art models and have won different machine learning challenges. Although these networks are inspired by the brain, they lack biological plausibility, and they have structural differences compared to the brain. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been around for a long time, and they have been investigated to understand the dynamics of the brain. However, their application in real-world and complicated machine learning tasks were limited. Recently, they have shown great potential in solving such tasks. Due to their energy efficiency and temporal dynamics there are many promises in their future development. In this work, we reviewed the structures and performances of SNNs on image classification tasks. The comparisons illustrate that these networks show great capabilities for more complicated problems. Furthermore, the simple learning rules developed for SNNs, such as STDP and R-STDP, can be a potential alternative to replace the backpropagation algorithm used in DNNs. 

### [Task Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04412)
Incidental supervision from language has become a popular approach for learning generic visual representations that can be prompted to perform many recognition tasks in computer vision. We conduct an in-depth exploration of the CLIP model and show that its visual representation is often strongly biased towards solving some tasks more than others. Moreover, which task the representation will be biased towards is unpredictable, with little consistency across images. To resolve this task bias, we show how to learn a visual prompt that guides the representation towards features relevant to their task of interest. Our results show that these visual prompts can be independent of the input image and still effectively provide a conditioning mechanism to steer visual representations towards the desired task. 

### [Diffusion Guided Domain Adaptation of Image Generators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04473)
Can a text-to-image diffusion model be used as a training objective for adapting a GAN generator to another domain? In this paper, we show that the classifier-free guidance can be leveraged as a critic and enable generators to distill knowledge from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Generators can be efficiently shifted into new domains indicated by text prompts without access to groundtruth samples from target domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our method through extensive experiments. Although not trained to minimize CLIP loss, our model achieves equally high CLIP scores and significantly lower FID than prior work on short prompts, and outperforms the baseline qualitatively and quantitatively on long and complicated prompts. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt at incorporating large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and distillation sampling for text-driven image generator domain adaptation and gives a quality previously beyond possible. Moreover, we extend our work to 3D-aware style-based generators and DreamBooth guidance. 

### [Multi-Concept Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04488)
While generative models produce high-quality images of concepts learned from a large-scale database, a user often wishes to synthesize instantiations of their own concepts (for example, their family, pets, or items). Can we teach a model to quickly acquire a new concept, given a few examples? Furthermore, can we compose multiple new concepts together? We propose Custom Diffusion, an efficient method for augmenting existing text-to-image models. We find that only optimizing a few parameters in the text-to-image conditioning mechanism is sufficiently powerful to represent new concepts while enabling fast tuning (~6 minutes). Additionally, we can jointly train for multiple concepts or combine multiple fine-tuned models into one via closed-form constrained optimization. Our fine-tuned model generates variations of multiple, new concepts and seamlessly composes them with existing concepts in novel settings. Our method outperforms several baselines and concurrent works, regarding both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while being memory and computationally efficient. 

### [SINE: SINgle Image Editing with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04489)
Recent works on diffusion models have demonstrated a strong capability for conditioning image generation, e.g., text-guided image synthesis. Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation. The code is available for research purposes at https://github.com/zhang-zx/SINE.git . 

### [SDFusion: Multimodal 3D Shape Completion, Reconstruction, and Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04493)
In this work, we present a novel framework built to simplify 3D asset generation for amateur users. To enable interactive generation, our method supports a variety of input modalities that can be easily provided by a human, including images, text, partially observed shapes and combinations of these, further allowing to adjust the strength of each input. At the core of our approach is an encoder-decoder, compressing 3D shapes into a compact latent representation, upon which a diffusion model is learned. To enable a variety of multi-modal inputs, we employ task-specific encoders with dropout followed by a cross-attention mechanism. Due to its flexibility, our model naturally supports a variety of tasks, outperforming prior works on shape completion, image-based 3D reconstruction, and text-to-3D. Most interestingly, our model can combine all these tasks into one swiss-army-knife tool, enabling the user to perform shape generation using incomplete shapes, images, and textual descriptions at the same time, providing the relative weights for each input and facilitating interactivity. Despite our approach being shape-only, we further show an efficient method to texture the generated shape using large-scale text-to-image models. 

### [MoFusion: A Framework for Denoising-Diffusion-based Motion Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04495)
Conventional methods for human motion synthesis are either deterministic or struggle with the trade-off between motion diversity and motion quality. In response to these limitations, we introduce MoFusion, i.e., a new denoising-diffusion-based framework for high-quality conditional human motion synthesis that can generate long, temporally plausible, and semantically accurate motions based on a range of conditioning contexts (such as music and text). We also present ways to introduce well-known kinematic losses for motion plausibility within the motion diffusion framework through our scheduled weighting strategy. The learned latent space can be used for several interactive motion editing applications -- like inbetweening, seed conditioning, and text-based editing -- thus, providing crucial abilities for virtual character animation and robotics. Through comprehensive quantitative evaluations and a perceptual user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFusion compared to the state of the art on established benchmarks in the literature. We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video and visit https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/MoFusion. 

### [UNETR++: Delving into Efficient and Accurate 3D Medical Image  Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04497)
Owing to the success of transformer models, recent works study their applicability in 3D medical segmentation tasks. Within the transformer models, the self-attention mechanism is one of the main building blocks that strives to capture long-range dependencies, compared to the local convolutional-based design. However, the self-attention operation has quadratic complexity which proves to be a computational bottleneck, especially in volumetric medical imaging, where the inputs are 3D with numerous slices. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++, that offers both high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms of parameters and compute cost. The core of our design is the introduction of a novel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently learns spatial and channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of inter-dependent branches based on spatial and channel attention. Our spatial attention formulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the input sequence length. To enable communication between spatial and channel-focused branches, we share the weights of query and key mapping functions that provide a complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also reducing the overall network parameters. Our extensive evaluations on three benchmarks, Synapse, BTCV and ACDC, reveal the effectiveness of the proposed contributions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. On Synapse dataset, our UNETR++ sets a new state-of-the-art with a Dice Similarity Score of 87.2%, while being significantly efficient with a reduction of over 71% in terms of both parameters and FLOPs, compared to the best existing method in the literature.

### [Minimizing the Sombor Index among Trees with Fixed Degree Sequence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03959)
Vertex-degree-based topological indices have recently gained a lot of attention from mathematical chemists. One such index that we focus on in this paper is called Sombor index. After its definition in late 2020, the Sombor index was quickly recognized as a valuable research topic. In this paper we partially answer the open question of finding the extremal trees with respect to this index for a fixed degree sequence. Particularly we focus on the lower bound and proceed to show that greedy tree minimizes the Sombor index for a given degree sequence. 

### [Statistical and Computational Guarantees for Influence Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04014)
Influence diagnostics such as influence functions and approximate maximum influence perturbations are popular in machine learning and in AI domain applications. Influence diagnostics are powerful statistical tools to identify influential datapoints or subsets of datapoints. We establish finite-sample statistical bounds, as well as computational complexity bounds, for influence functions and approximate maximum influence perturbations using efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product implementations. We illustrate our results with generalized linear models and large attention based models on synthetic and real data. 

### [Coloring Inside the Lines: The Jagged Legacy of the HOLC Neighborhood  Risk Maps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04117)
There has been a large body of work exploring the discriminatory nature of the home mortgage risk maps produced by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation in the late 1930s. However, little attention has been paid to the question of whether these maps are still descriptive of racial residential boundaries in their cities 80 years after their creation. To address this gap, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, previously unutilized in the relevant literature, is employed to randomly generate many plausible alternative mortgage security maps. Then, the racial evenness of the HOLC maps and the generated maps is compared using Shannon's entropy. These findings indicate that the HOLC maps are significantly descriptive of the precise racial residential boundaries prevalent across eleven US cities in 2010. The methodology used here is highly modular and reproducible, allowing for future work measuring different outcome statistics, locations, and time periods. 

### [A Characterization of Maximum Nash Welfare for Indivisible Goods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04203)
In the allocation of indivisible goods, the maximum Nash welfare (MNW) rule, which chooses an allocation maximizing the product of the agents' utilities, has received substantial attention for its fairness. We characterize MNW as the only additive welfarist rule that satisfies envy-freeness up to one good. Our characterization holds in the simplest setting of two agents.
