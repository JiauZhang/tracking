        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The use of Attention Layers has become a trend since the popularization of the Transformer-based models, being the key element for many state-of-the-art models that have been developed through recent years. However, one of the biggest obstacles in implementing these architectures - as well as many others in Deep Learning Field - is the enormous amount of optimizing parameters they possess, which make its use conditioned on the availability of robust hardware. In this paper, it's proposed a new method of attention mechanism that adapts the Dot-Product Attention, which uses matrices multiplications, to become element-wise through the use of arrays multiplications. To test the effectiveness of such approach, two models (one with a VGG-like architecture and one with the proposed method) have been trained in a classification task using Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Each model has been trained for 10 epochs in a single Tesla T4 GPU from Google Colaboratory. The results show that this mechanism allows for an accuracy of 92% of the VGG-like counterpart in Fashion MNIST dataset, while reducing the number of parameters in 97%. For CIFAR10, the accuracy is still equivalent to 60% of the VGG-like counterpart while using 50% less parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent conditional image generation methods produce images of remarkable diversity, fidelity and realism. However, the majority of these methods allow conditioning only on labels or text prompts, which limits their level of control over the generation result. In this paper, we introduce MaskSketch, an image generation method that allows spatial conditioning of the generation result using a guiding sketch as an extra conditioning signal during sampling. MaskSketch utilizes a pre-trained masked generative transformer, requiring no model training or paired supervision, and works with input sketches of different levels of abstraction. We show that intermediate self-attention maps of a masked generative transformer encode important structural information of the input image, such as scene layout and object shape, and we propose a novel sampling method based on this observation to enable structure-guided generation. Our results show that MaskSketch achieves high image realism and fidelity to the guiding structure. Evaluated on standard benchmark datasets, MaskSketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sketch-to-image translation, as well as unpaired image-to-image translation approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-based game environments are challenging because agents must deal with long sequences of text, execute compositional actions using text and learn from sparse rewards. We address these challenges by proposing Long-Context Language Decision Transformers (LLDTs), a framework that is based on long transformer language models and decision transformers (DTs). LLDTs extend DTs with 3 components: (1) exponential tilt to guide the agent towards high obtainable goals, (2) novel goal conditioning methods yielding significantly better results than the traditional return-to-go (sum of all future rewards), and (3) a model of future observations. Our ablation results show that predicting future observations improves agent performance. To the best of our knowledge, LLDTs are the first to address offline RL with DTs on these challenging games. Our experiments show that LLDTs achieve the highest scores among many different types of agents on some of the most challenging Jericho games, such as Enchanter. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Studies have shown that large pretrained language models exhibit biases against social groups based on race, gender etc, which they inherit from the datasets they are trained on. Various researchers have proposed mathematical tools for quantifying and identifying these biases. There have been methods proposed to mitigate such biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of different kinds of biases such as race, gender, ethnicity, age etc. exhibited by popular pretrained language models such as BERT, GPT-2 etc. and also present a toolkit that provides plug-and-play interfaces to connect mathematical tools to identify biases with large pretrained language models such as BERT, GPT-2 etc. and also present users with the opportunity to test custom models against these metrics. The toolkit also allows users to debias existing and custom models using the debiasing techniques proposed so far.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a neural network structure, ControlNet, to control pretrained large diffusion models to support additional input conditions. The ControlNet learns task-specific conditions in an end-to-end way, and the learning is robust even when the training dataset is small (&lt; 50k). Moreover, training a ControlNet is as fast as fine-tuning a diffusion model, and the model can be trained on a personal devices. Alternatively, if powerful computation clusters are available, the model can scale to large amounts (millions to billions) of data. We report that large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be augmented with ControlNets to enable conditional inputs like edge maps, segmentation maps, keypoints, etc. This may enrich the methods to control large diffusion models and further facilitate related applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to decompose aggregated electrical usage signal into appliance-specific power consumption and it amounts to a classical example of blind source separation tasks. Leveraging recent progress on deep learning techniques, we design a new neural NILM model Multi-State Dual CNN (MSDC). Different from previous models, MSDC explicitly extracts information about the appliance's multiple states and state transitions, which in turn regulates the prediction of signals for appliances. More specifically, we employ a dual-CNN architecture: one CNN for outputting state distributions and the other for predicting the power of each state. A new technique is invented that utilizes conditional random fields (CRF) to capture state transitions. Experiments on two real-world datasets REDD and UK-DALE demonstrate that our model significantly outperform state-of-the-art models while having good generalization capacity, achieving 6%-10% MAE gain and 33%-51% SAE gain to unseen appliances. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel 3d colored shape reconstruction method from a single RGB image through diffusion model. Diffusion models have shown great development potentials for high-quality 3D shape generation. However, most existing work based on diffusion models only focus on geometric shape generation, they cannot either accomplish 3D reconstruction from a single image, or produce 3D geometric shape with color information. In this work, we propose to reconstruct a 3D colored shape from a single RGB image through a novel conditional diffusion model. The reverse process of the proposed diffusion model is consisted of three modules, shape prediction module, color prediction module and NeRF-like rendering module. In shape prediction module, the reference RGB image is first encoded into a high-level shape feature and then the shape feature is utilized as a condition to predict the reverse geometric noise in diffusion model. Then the color of each 3D point updated in shape prediction module is predicted by color prediction module. Finally, a NeRF-like rendering module is designed to render the colored point cloud predicted by the former two modules to 2D image space to guide the training conditioned only on a reference image. As far as the authors know, the proposed method is the first diffusion model for 3D colored shape reconstruction from a single RGB image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on colored 3D shape reconstruction, and the ablation study validates the positive role of the color prediction module in improving the reconstruction quality of 3D geometric point cloud. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Intelligent Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning is central to cost and resource efficient computation in cloud computing environments. As bootstrapping VMs is time-consuming, a key challenge for latency-critical tasks is to predict future workload demands to provision VMs proactively. However, existing AI-based solutions \blue{tend to not holistically consider} all crucial aspects such as provisioning overheads, heterogeneous VM costs and Quality of Service (QoS) of the cloud system. To address this, we propose a novel method, called CILP, that formulates the VM provisioning problem as two sub-problems of prediction and optimization, where the provisioning plan is optimized based on predicted workload demands. CILP leverages a neural network as a surrogate model to predict future workload demands with a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to compute QoS scores. We extend the neural network to also act as an imitation learner that dynamically decides the optimal VM provisioning plan. A transformer based neural model reduces training and inference overheads while our novel two-phase decision making loop facilitates in making informed provisioning decisions. Crucially, we address limitations of prior work by including resource utilization, deployment costs and provisioning overheads to inform the provisioning decisions in our imitation learning framework. Experiments with three public benchmarks demonstrate that CILP gives up to 22% higher resource utilization, 14% higher QoS scores and 44% lower execution costs compared to the current online and offline optimization based state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

It contains 6.7k annotated business documents, 100k synthetically generated documents, and nearly~1M unlabeled documents for unsupervised pre-training. The dataset has been built with knowledge of domain- and task-specific aspects, resulting in the following key features: (i) annotations in 55 classes, which surpasses the granularity of previously published key information extraction datasets by a large margin; (ii) Line Item Recognition represents a highly practical information extraction task, where key information has to be assigned to items in a table; (iii) documents come from numerous layouts and the test set includes zero- and few-shot cases as well as layouts commonly seen in the training set. The benchmark comes with several baselines, including RoBERTa, LayoutLMv3 and DETR-based Table Transformer. These baseline models were applied to both tasks of the DocILE benchmark, with results shared in this paper, offering a quick starting point for future work.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Vehicle re-identification is a cross-view search task by matching the same target vehicle from different perspectives. It serves an important role in road-vehicle collaboration and intelligent road control. With the large-scale and dynamic road environment, the paradigm of supervised vehicle re-identification shows limited scalability because of the heavy reliance on large-scale annotated datasets. Therefore, the unsupervised vehicle re-identification with stronger cross-scene generalization ability has attracted more attention. Considering that Masked Autoencoder (MAE) has shown excellent performance in self-supervised learning, this work designs a Contour Guided Masked Autoencoder for Unsupervised Vehicle Re-Identification (ConMAE), which is inspired by extracting the informative contour clue to highlight the key regions for cross-view correlation. ConMAE is implemented by preserving the image blocks with contour pixels and randomly masking the blocks with smooth textures. In addition, to improve the quality of pseudo labels of vehicles for unsupervised re-identification, we design a label softening strategy and adaptively update the label with the increase of training steps. We carry out experiments on VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, and a significant performance improvement is obtained by the comparison with the state-of-the-art unsupervised vehicle re-identification methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a novel fully implicit hybrid finite volume/finite element method for incompressible flows. Following previous works on semi-implicit hybrid FV/FE schemes, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are split into a pressure and a transport-diffusion subsystem. The first of them can be seen as a Poisson type problem and is thus solved efficiently using classical continuous Lagrange finite elements. On the other hand, finite volume methods are employed to solve the convective subsystem, in combination with Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements for the discretization of the viscous stress tensor. For some applications, the related CFL condition, even if depending only in the bulk velocity, may yield a severe time restriction in case explicit schemes are used. To overcome this issue an implicit approach is proposed. The system obtained from the implicit discretization of the transport-diffusion operator is solved using an inexact Newton-Krylov method, based either on the BiCStab or the GMRES algorithm. To improve the convergence properties of the linear solver a symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SGS) preconditioner is employed, together with a simple but efficient approach for the reordering of the grid elements that is compatible with MPI parallelization. Besides, considering the Ducros flux for the nonlinear convective terms we can prove that the discrete advection scheme is kinetic energy stable. The methodology is carefully assessed through a set of classical benchmarks for fluid mechanics. A last test shows the potential applicability of the method in the context of blood flow simulation in realistic vessel geometries. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Attention mechanism has been widely utilized in speech enhancement (SE) because theoretically it can effectively model the long-term inherent connection of signal both in time domain and spectrum domain. However, the generally used global attention mechanism might not be the best choice since the adjacent information naturally imposes more influence than the far-apart information in speech enhancement. In this paper, we validate this conjecture by replacing attention with RNN in two typical state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, multi-scale temporal frequency convolutional network (MTFAA) with axial attention and conformer-based metric-GAN network (CMGAN). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Detecting deception by human behaviors is vital in many fields such as custom security and multimedia anti-fraud. Recently, audio-visual deception detection attracts more attention due to its better performance than using only a single modality. However, in real-world multi-modal settings, the integrity of data can be an issue (e.g., sometimes only partial modalities are available). The missing modality might lead to a decrease in performance, but the model still learns the features of the missed modality. In this paper, to further improve the performance and overcome the missing modality problem, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework with an Audio-Visual Adapter (AVA) to fuse temporal features across two modalities efficiently. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared with other multi-modal fusion methods under flexible-modal (multiple and missing modalities) settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

However, there are still no works to explore the fundamental natures (\textit{e.g.}, modality-aware inputs, suitable multimodal pre-training, and efficient finetuning) in vanilla ViT for multimodal FAS. In this paper, we investigate three key factors (i.e., inputs, pre-training, and finetuning) in ViT for multimodal FAS with RGB, Infrared (IR), and Depth. First, in terms of the ViT inputs, we find that leveraging local feature descriptors benefits the ViT on IR modality but not RGB or Depth modalities. Second, in observation of the inefficiency on direct finetuning the whole or partial ViT, we design an adaptive multimodal adapter (AMA), which can efficiently aggregate local multimodal features while freezing majority of ViT parameters. Finally, in consideration of the task (FAS vs. generic object classification) and modality (multimodal vs. unimodal) gaps, ImageNet pre-trained models might be sub-optimal for the multimodal FAS task. To bridge these gaps, we propose the modality-asymmetric masked autoencoder (M$^{2}$A$^{2}$E) for multimodal FAS self-supervised pre-training without costly annotated labels. Compared with the previous modality-symmetric autoencoder, the proposed M$^{2}$A$^{2}$E is able to learn more intrinsic task-aware representation and compatible with modality-agnostic (e.g., unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal) downstream settings. Extensive experiments with both unimodal (RGB, Depth, IR) and multimodal (RGB+Depth, RGB+IR, Depth+IR, RGB+Depth+IR) settings conducted on multimodal FAS benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods. We hope these findings and solutions can facilitate the future research for ViT-based multimodal FAS. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Medical experts may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems with greater trust if these are supported by contextual explanations that let the practitioner connect system inferences to their context of use. However, their importance in improving model usage and understanding has not been extensively studied. Hence, we consider a comorbidity risk prediction scenario and focus on contexts regarding the patients clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We explore how relevant information for such dimensions can be extracted from Medical guidelines to answer typical questions from clinical practitioners. We identify this as a question answering (QA) task and employ several state-of-the-art LLMs to present contexts around risk prediction model inferences and evaluate their acceptability. Finally, we study the benefits of contextual explanations by building an end-to-end AI pipeline including data cohorting, AI risk modeling, post-hoc model explanations, and prototyped a visual dashboard to present the combined insights from different context dimensions and data sources, while predicting and identifying the drivers of risk of Chronic Kidney Disease - a common type-2 diabetes comorbidity. All of these steps were performed in engagement with medical experts, including a final evaluation of the dashboard results by an expert medical panel. We show that LLMs, in particular BERT and SciBERT, can be readily deployed to extract some relevant explanations to support clinical usage. To understand the value-add of the contextual explanations, the expert panel evaluated these regarding actionable insights in the relevant clinical setting. Overall, our paper is one of the first end-to-end analyses identifying the feasibility and benefits of contextual explanations in a real-world clinical use case. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human-robot interaction (HRI) research is progressively addressing multi-party scenarios, where a robot interacts with more than one human user at the same time. Conversely, research is still at an early stage for human-robot collaboration (HRC). The use of machine learning techniques to handle such type of collaboration requires data that are less feasible to produce than in a typical HRC setup. This work outlines concepts of design of concurrent tasks for non-dyadic HRC applications. Based upon these concepts, this study also proposes an alternative way of gathering data regarding multiuser activity, by collecting data related to single subjects and merging them in post-processing, to reduce the effort involved in producing recordings of pair settings. To validate this statement, 3D skeleton poses of activity of single subjects were collected and merged in pairs. After this, the datapoints were used to separately train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) composed of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STGCN) to recognise the joint activities of the pairs of people. The results showed that it is possible to make use of data collected in this way for pair HRC settings and get similar performances compared to using data regarding groups of users recorded under the same settings, relieving from the technical difficulties involved in producing these data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB), a new class of conditional diffusion models that directly learn the nonlinear diffusion processes between two given distributions. These diffusion bridges are particularly useful for image restoration, as the degraded images are structurally informative priors for reconstructing the clean images. I$^2$SB belongs to a tractable class of Schr\"odinger bridge, the nonlinear extension to score-based models, whose marginal distributions can be computed analytically given boundary pairs. This results in a simulation-free framework for nonlinear diffusions, where the I$^2$SB training becomes scalable by adopting practical techniques used in standard diffusion models. We validate I$^2$SB in solving various image restoration tasks, including inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring, and JPEG restoration on ImageNet 256x256 and show that I$^2$SB surpasses standard conditional diffusion models with more interpretable generative processes. Moreover, I$^2$SB matches the performance of inverse methods that additionally require the knowledge of the corruption operators. Our work opens up new algorithmic opportunities for developing efficient nonlinear diffusion models on a large scale. scale.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the power of large pretrained language models, various research works have integrated knowledge into dialogue systems. The traditional techniques treat knowledge as part of the input sequence for the dialogue system, prepending a set of knowledge statements in front of dialogue history. However, such a mechanism forces knowledge sets to be concatenated in an ordered manner, making models implicitly pay imbalanced attention to the sets during training. In this paper, we first investigate how the order of the knowledge set can influence autoregressive dialogue systems' responses. We conduct experiments on two commonly used dialogue datasets with two types of transformer-based models and find that models view the input knowledge unequally. To this end, we propose a simple and novel technique to alleviate the order effect by modifying the position embeddings of knowledge input in these models. With the proposed position embedding method, the experimental results show that each knowledge statement is uniformly considered to generate responses. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Synthesizing realistic animations of humans, animals, and even imaginary creatures, has long been a goal for artists and computer graphics professionals. Compared to the imaging domain, which is rich with large available datasets, the number of data instances for the motion domain is limited, particularly for the animation of animals and exotic creatures (e.g., dragons), which have unique skeletons and motion patterns. In this work, we present a Single Motion Diffusion Model, dubbed SinMDM, a model designed to learn the internal motifs of a single motion sequence with arbitrary topology and synthesize motions of arbitrary length that are faithful to them. We harness the power of diffusion models and present a denoising network designed specifically for the task of learning from a single input motion. Our transformer-based architecture avoids overfitting by using local attention layers that narrow the receptive field, and encourages motion diversity by using relative positional embedding. SinMDM can be applied in a variety of contexts, including spatial and temporal in-betweening, motion expansion, style transfer, and crowd animation. Our results show that SinMDM outperforms existing methods both in quality and time-space efficiency. Moreover, while current approaches require additional training for different applications, our work facilitates these applications at inference time.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning deep discrete latent presentations offers a promise of better symbolic and summarized abstractions that are more useful to subsequent downstream tasks. Inspired by the seminal Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE), most of work in learning deep discrete representations has mainly focused on improving the original VQ-VAE form and none of them has studied learning deep discrete representations from the generative viewpoint. In this work, we study learning deep discrete representations from the generative viewpoint. Specifically, we endow discrete distributions over sequences of codewords and learn a deterministic decoder that transports the distribution over the sequences of codewords to the data distribution via minimizing a WS distance between them. We develop further theories to connect it with the clustering viewpoint of WS distance, allowing us to have a better and more controllable clustering solution. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on several well-known benchmarks, where it achieves better qualitative and quantitative performances than the other VQ-VAE variants in terms of the codebook utilization and image reconstruction/generation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The goal of Few-Shot Continual Learning (FSCL) is to incrementally learn novel tasks with limited labeled samples and preserve previous capabilities simultaneously, while current FSCL methods are all for the class-incremental purpose. Moreover, the evaluation of FSCL solutions is only the cumulative performance of all encountered tasks, but there is no work on exploring the domain generalization ability. Domain generalization is a challenging yet practical task that aims to generalize beyond training domains. In this paper, we set up a Generalized FSCL (GFSCL) protocol involving both class- and domain-incremental situations together with the domain generalization assessment. Firstly, two benchmark datasets and protocols are newly arranged, and detailed baselines are provided for this unexplored configuration. We find that common continual learning methods have poor generalization ability on unseen domains and cannot better cope with the catastrophic forgetting issue in cross-incremental tasks. In this way, we further propose a rehearsal-free framework based on Vision Transformer (ViT) named Contrastive Mixture of Adapters (CMoA). Due to different optimization targets of class increment and domain increment, the CMoA contains two parts: (1) For the class-incremental issue, the Mixture of Adapters (MoA) module is incorporated into ViT, then cosine similarity regularization and the dynamic weighting are designed to make each adapter learn specific knowledge and concentrate on particular classes. (2) For the domain-related issues and domain-invariant representation learning, we alleviate the inner-class variation by prototype-calibrated contrastive learning.

In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervision objective for the analysis of cells in biomedical microscopy images. We propose training deep learning models to pseudo-colorize masked cells. We use a physics-informed pseudo-spectral colormap that is well suited for colorizing cell topology. Our experiments reveal that approximating semantic segmentation by pseudo-colorization is beneficial for subsequent fine-tuning on cell detection. Inspired by the recent success of masked image modeling, we additionally mask out cell parts and train to reconstruct these parts to further enrich the learned representations. We compare our pre-training method with self-supervised frameworks including contrastive learning (SimCLR), masked autoencoders (MAEs), and edge-based self-supervision. We build upon our previous work and train hybrid models for cell detection, which contain both convolutional and vision transformer modules. Our pre-training method can outperform SimCLR, MAE-like masked image modeling, and edge-based self-supervision when pre-training on a diverse set of six fluorescence microscopy datasets.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithms provide a technique to generate complex and diverse environments in an automated way. However, while generating content with PCG methods is often straightforward, generating meaningful content that reflects specific intentions and constraints remains challenging. Furthermore, many PCG algorithms lack the ability to generate content in an open-ended manner. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be incredibly effective in many diverse domains. These trained LLMs can be fine-tuned, re-using information and accelerating training for new tasks. In this work, we introduce MarioGPT, a fine-tuned GPT2 model trained to generate tile-based game levels, in our case Super Mario Bros levels. We show that MarioGPT can not only generate diverse levels, but can be text-prompted for controllable level generation, addressing one of the key challenges of current PCG techniques. As far as we know, MarioGPT is the first text-to-level model. We also combine MarioGPT with novelty search, enabling it to generate diverse levels with varying play-style dynamics (i.e. player paths). This combination allows for the open-ended generation of an increasingly diverse range of content. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task which requires an agent to align complex visual observations to language instructions to reach the goal position. Most existing VLN agents directly learn to align the raw directional features and visual features trained using one-hot labels to linguistic instruction features. However, the big semantic gap among these multi-modal inputs makes the alignment difficult and therefore limits the navigation performance. In this paper, we propose Actional Atomic-Concept Learning (AACL), which maps visual observations to actional atomic concepts for facilitating the alignment. Specifically, an actional atomic concept is a natural language phrase containing an atomic action and an object, e.g., ``go up stairs''. These actional atomic concepts, which serve as the bridge between observations and instructions, can effectively mitigate the semantic gap and simplify the alignment. AACL contains three core components: 1) a concept mapping module to map the observations to the actional atomic concept representations through the VLN environment and the recently proposed Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, 2) a concept refining adapter to encourage more instruction-oriented object concept extraction by re-ranking the predicted object concepts by CLIP, and 3) an observation co-embedding module which utilizes concept representations to regularize the observation representations. Our AACL establishes new state-of-the-art results on both fine-grained (R2R) and high-level (REVERIE and R2R-Last) VLN benchmarks. Moreover, the visualization shows that AACL significantly improves the interpretability in action decision. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The goal of this task is to classify the emotion and the corresponding intensity expressed by memes, which are usually in the form of images with short captions on social media. Understanding the multi-modal features of the given memes will be the key to solving the task. In this work, we use CLIP to extract aligned image-text features and propose a novel meme sentiment analysis framework, consisting of a Cooperative Teaching Model (CTM) for Task A and a Cascaded Emotion Classifier (CEC) for Tasks B&amp;C. CTM is based on the idea of knowledge distillation, and can better predict the sentiment of a given meme in Task A; CEC can leverage the emotion intensity suggestion from the prediction of Task C to classify the emotion more precisely in Task B. Experiments show that we achieved the 2nd place ranking for both Task A and Task B and the 4th place ranking for Task C, with weighted F1-scores of 0.342, 0.784, and 0.535 respectively. The results show the robustness and effectiveness of our framework. Our code is released at github. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we study the local visual modeling with grid features for image captioning, which is critical for generating accurate and detailed captions. To achieve this target, we propose a Locality-Sensitive Transformer Network (LSTNet) with two novel designs, namely Locality-Sensitive Attention (LSA) and Locality-Sensitive Fusion (LSF). LSA is deployed for the intra-layer interaction in Transformer via modeling the relationship between each grid and its neighbors. It reduces the difficulty of local object recognition during captioning. LSF is used for inter-layer information fusion, which aggregates the information of different encoder layers for cross-layer semantical complementarity. With these two novel designs, the proposed LSTNet can model the local visual information of grid features to improve the captioning quality. To validate LSTNet, we conduct extensive experiments on the competitive MS-COCO benchmark. The experimental results show that LSTNet is not only capable of local visual modeling, but also outperforms a bunch of state-of-the-art captioning models on offline and online testings, i.e., 134.8 CIDEr and 136.3 CIDEr, respectively. Besides, the generalization of LSTNet is also verified on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Statutory reasoning is the task of reasoning with facts and statutes, which are rules written in natural language by a legislature. It is a basic legal skill. In this paper we explore the capabilities of the most capable GPT-3 model, text-davinci-003, on an established statutory-reasoning dataset called SARA. We consider a variety of approaches, including dynamic few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and zero-shot prompting. While we achieve results with GPT-3 that are better than the previous best published results, we also identify several types of clear errors it makes. In investigating why these happen, we discover that GPT-3 has imperfect prior knowledge of the actual U.S. statutes on which SARA is based. More importantly, GPT-3 performs poorly at answering straightforward questions about simple synthetic statutes. By also posing the same questions when the synthetic statutes are written in sentence form, we find that some of GPT-3's poor performance results from difficulty in parsing the typical structure of statutes, containing subsections and paragraphs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in deep generative adversarial networks (GAN) and self-attention mechanism have led to significant improvements in the challenging task of inpainting large missing regions in an image. These methods integrate self-attention mechanism in neural networks to utilize surrounding neural elements based on their correlation and help the networks capture long-range dependencies. Temperature is a parameter in the Softmax function used in the self-attention, and it enables biasing the distribution of attention scores towards a handful of similar patches. Most existing self-attention mechanisms in image inpainting are convolution-based and set the temperature as a constant, performing patch matching in a limited feature space. In this work, we analyze the artifacts and training problems in previous self-attention mechanisms, and redesign the temperature learning network as well as the self-attention mechanism to address them. We present an image inpainting framework with a multi-head temperature masked self-attention mechanism, which provides stable and efficient temperature learning and uses multiple distant contextual information for high quality image inpainting. In addition to improving image quality of inpainting results, we generalize the proposed model to user-guided image editing by introducing a new sketch generation method. Extensive experiments on various datasets such as Paris StreetView, CelebA-HQ and Places2 clearly demonstrate that our method not only generates more natural inpainting results than previous works both in terms of perception image quality and quantitative metrics, but also enables to help users to generate more flexible results that are related to their sketch guidance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Point cloud panoptic segmentation is a challenging task that seeks a holistic solution for both semantic and instance segmentation to predict groupings of coherent points. Previous approaches treat semantic and instance segmentation as surrogate tasks, and they either use clustering methods or bounding boxes to gather instance groupings with costly computation and hand-crafted designs in the instance segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective point cloud unified panoptic segmentation (PUPS) framework, which use a set of point-level classifiers to directly predict semantic and instance groupings in an end-to-end manner. To realize PUPS, we introduce bipartite matching to our training pipeline so that our classifiers are able to exclusively predict groupings of instances, getting rid of hand-crafted designs, e.g. anchors and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). In order to achieve better grouping results, we utilize a transformer decoder to iteratively refine the point classifiers and develop a context-aware CutMix augmentation to overcome the class imbalance problem. As a result, PUPS achieves 1st place on the leader board of SemanticKITTI panoptic segmentation task and state-of-the-art results on nuScenes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent years have witnessed increasing interests in prompt-based learning in which models can be trained on only a few annotated instances, making them suitable in low-resource settings. When using prompt-based learning for text classification, the goal is to use a pre-trained language model (PLM) to predict a missing token in a pre-defined template given an input text, which can be mapped to a class label. However, PLMs built on the transformer architecture tend to generate similar output embeddings, making it difficult to discriminate between different class labels. The problem is further exacerbated when dealing with classification tasks involving many fine-grained class labels. In this work, we alleviate this information diffusion issue, i.e., different tokens share a large proportion of similar information after going through stacked multiple self-attention layers in a transformer, by proposing a calibration method built on feature transformations through rotation and scaling to map a PLM-encoded embedding into a new metric space to guarantee the distinguishability of the resulting embeddings. Furthermore, we take the advantage of hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical relations among fine-grained class-associated token embedding by a coarse-to-fine metric learning strategy to enhance the distinguishability of the learned output embeddings. Extensive experiments on the three datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Ever since their conception, Transformers have taken over traditional sequence models in many tasks, such as NLP, image classification, and video/audio processing, for their fast training and superior performance. Much of these merits result from positional encoding and multi-head attention. However, Transformers fall short in learning long-range dependencies mainly due to the quadratic complexity scaled with context length, in terms of both time and space. Consequently, over the past five years, a myriad of methods has been proposed to make Transformers more efficient. In this work, we first take a step back, study and compare existing solutions to long-sequence modeling in terms of their pure mathematical formulation. Specifically, we summarize them using a unified template, given their shared nature of token mixing. Through benchmarks, we then demonstrate that long context length does yield better performance, albeit application-dependent, and traditional Transformer models fall short in taking advantage of long-range dependencies. Next, inspired by emerging sparse models of huge capacity, we propose a machine learning system for handling million-scale dependencies. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the performance of one essential component of this system, namely, the distributed multi-head attention. We show that our algorithm can scale up attention computation by almost $40\times$ using four GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs, compared to vanilla multi-head attention mechanism. We believe this study is an instrumental step towards modeling million-scale dependencies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Language-supervised vision models have recently attracted great attention in computer vision. A common approach to build such models is to use contrastive learning on paired data across the two modalities, as exemplified by Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). In this paper, under linear representation settings, (i) we initiate the investigation of a general class of nonlinear loss functions for multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) including CLIP loss and show its connection to singular value decomposition (SVD). Namely, we show that each step of loss minimization by gradient descent can be seen as performing SVD on a contrastive cross-covariance matrix. Based on this insight, (ii) we analyze the performance of MMCL. We quantitatively show that the feature learning ability of MMCL can be better than that of unimodal contrastive learning applied to each modality even under the presence of wrongly matched pairs. This characterizes the robustness of MMCL to noisy data. Furthermore, when we have access to additional unpaired data, (iii) we propose a new MMCL loss that incorporates additional unpaired datasets. We show that the algorithm can detect the ground-truth pairs and improve performance by fully exploiting unpaired datasets. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by numerical experiments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Massive samples of event sequences data occur in various domains, including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance. There are two main challenges regarding inference of such data: computational and methodological. The amount of available data and the length of event sequences per client are typically large, thus it requires long-term modelling. Moreover, this data is often sparse and non-uniform, making classic approaches for time series processing inapplicable. Existing solutions include recurrent and transformer architectures in such cases. To allow continuous time, the authors introduce specific parametric intensity functions defined at each moment on top of existing models. Due to the parametric nature, these intensities represent only a limited class of event sequences. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Relation-focused cross-modal information retrieval focuses on retrieving information based on relations expressed in user queries, and it is particularly important in information retrieval applications and next-generation search engines. To date, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) achieved state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal learning tasks due to its efficient learning of visual concepts from natural language supervision. However, CLIP learns visual representations from natural language at a global level without the capability of focusing on image-object relations. This paper proposes a novel CLIP-based network for Relation Reasoning, CLIP-RR, that tackles relation-focused cross-modal information retrieval. The proposed network utilises CLIP to leverage its pre-trained knowledge, and it additionally comprises two main parts: (1) extends the capabilities of CLIP to extract and reason with object relations in images; and (2) aggregates the reasoned results for predicting the similarity scores between images and descriptions. Experiments were carried out by applying the proposed network to relation-focused cross-modal information retrieval tasks on the RefCOCOg, CLEVR, and Flickr30K datasets. The results revealed that the proposed network outperformed various other state-of-the-art networks including CLIP, VSE$\infty$, and VSRN++ on both image-to-text and text-to-image cross-modal information retrieval tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper addresses the problem of anticipating the next-active-object location in the future, for a given egocentric video clip where the contact might happen, before any action takes place. The problem is considerably hard, as we aim at estimating the position of such objects in a scenario where the observed clip and the action segment are separated by the so-called ``time to contact'' (TTC) segment. Many methods have been proposed to anticipate the action of a person based on previous hand movements and interactions with the surroundings. However, there have been no attempts to investigate the next possible interactable object, and its future location with respect to the first-person's motion and the field-of-view drift during the TTC window. We define this as the task of Anticipating the Next ACTive Object (ANACTO). To this end, we propose a transformer-based self-attention framework to identify and locate the next-active-object in an egocentric clip. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Transformer architecture consists of self-attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs) which can be viewed as key-value memories according to previous works. However, FFN and traditional memory utilize different activation functions (i.e., ReLU and Softmax respectively), which makes them not equivalent. In this paper, we first rebuild the connections between FFN and key-value memory by conducting extensive studies on ReLU and Softmax, and find they are equivalent when adding an additional layer normalization module on Softmax. In addition, ReLU outperforms Softmax on both FFN and key-value memory when the number of value slots is large. We analyze the reasons and then explore this good property of ReLU on the self-attention network where the original Softmax activation performs poorly on long input sequences. We then propose a full ReLU architecture named ReLUFormer which performs better than the baseline Transformer on long sequence tasks such as document translation. This paper sheds light on the following points: 1) Softmax and ReLU use different normalization methods over elements which lead to different variances of results, and ReLU is good at dealing with a large number of key-value slots; 2) FFN and key-value memory are equivalent, and thus the Transformer can be viewed as a memory network where FFNs and self-attention networks are both key-value memories. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer inference requires high compute accuracy; achieving this using analog CIMs has been difficult due to inherent computational errors. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Capacitor-Reconfiguring CIM (CR-CIM) to realize high compute accuracy analog CIM with a 10-bit ADC attaining high-area/power efficiency. CR-CIM reconfigures its capacitor array to serve dual purposes: for computation and ADC conversion, achieving significant area savings. Furthermore, CR-CIMs eliminate signal attenuation by keeping the signal charge stationary during operation, leading to a 4x improvement in comparator energy efficiency. We also propose a software-analog co-design technique integrating majority voting into the 10-bit ADC to dynamically optimize the CIM noise performance based on the running layer to further save inference power. Our CR-CIM achieves the highest compute-accuracy for analog CIMs, and the power efficiency of 818 TOPS/W is competitive with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the FoM considering SQNR and CSNR is 2.3x and 1.5x better than previous works, respectively. Vision Transformer (ViT) inference is achieved and realizes a highest CIFAR10 accuracy of 95.8% for analog CIMs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks zero-shot -- i.e., without adaptation on downstream data. Recently, the debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate high-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based on subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this work, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by evaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task categories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that ChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g., arithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific tasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis through qualitative case studies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models. However, a fundamental limitation is that their sampling process is slow due to a need for many (\eg, $2000$) iterations of sequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the sampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We assault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and reverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a model-agnostic {\bf\em preconditioned diffusion sampling} (PDS) method that leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost, and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output distribution of the SGM, no risk of inducing systematical bias to the original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations,easing the parameter estimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various image datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our PDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the synthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to $29\times$ on more challenging high resolution (1024$\times$1024) image generation. Compared with the latest generative models (\eg, CLD-SGM, DDIM, and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the best sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at a FID score of 1.99. Our code is made publicly available to foster any further research https://github.com/fudan-zvg/PDS. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) are said to ``lack the ability to connect [their] utterances to the world'' (Bender and Koller, 2020). If so, we would expect LM representations to be unrelated to representations in computer vision models. To investigate this, we present an empirical evaluation across three different LMs (BERT, GPT2, and OPT) and three computer vision models (VMs, including ResNet, SegFormer, and MAE). Our experiments show that LMs converge towards representations that are partially isomorphic to those of VMs, with dispersion, and polysemy both factoring into the alignability of vision and language spaces. We discuss the implications of this finding. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are inspired by physics and employ stochastic fluctuations. We connect these physics-inspired AI algorithms by unifying them under a single mathematical framework that we call Thermodynamic AI. Seemingly disparate algorithmic classes can be described by this framework, for example, (1) Generative diffusion models, (2) Bayesian neural networks, (3) Monte Carlo sampling and (4) Simulated annealing. Such Thermodynamic AI algorithms are currently run on digital hardware, ultimately limiting their scalability and overall potential. Stochastic fluctuations naturally occur in physical thermodynamic systems, and such fluctuations can be viewed as a computational resource. Hence, we propose a novel computing paradigm, where software and hardware become inseparable. Our algorithmic unification allows us to identify a single full-stack paradigm, involving Thermodynamic AI hardware, that could accelerate such algorithms. We contrast Thermodynamic AI hardware with quantum computing where noise is a roadblock rather than a resource. Thermodynamic AI hardware can be viewed as a novel form of computing, since it uses a novel fundamental building block. We identify stochastic bits (s-bits) and stochastic modes (s-modes) as the respective building blocks for discrete and continuous Thermodynamic AI hardware. In addition to these stochastic units, Thermodynamic AI hardware employs a Maxwell's demon device that guides the system to produce non-trivial states. We provide a few simple physical architectures for building these devices and we develop a formalism for programming the hardware via gate sequences. We hope to stimulate discussion around this new computing paradigm. Beyond acceleration, we believe it will impact the design of both hardware and algorithms, while also deepening our understanding of the connection between physics and intelligence. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present an approach to mitigating the risks of malicious image editing posed by large diffusion models. The key idea is to immunize images so as to make them resistant to manipulation by these models. This immunization relies on injection of imperceptible adversarial perturbations designed to disrupt the operation of the targeted diffusion models, forcing them to generate unrealistic images. We provide two methods for crafting such perturbations, and then demonstrate their efficacy. Finally, we discuss a policy component necessary to make our approach fully effective and practical -- one that involves the organizations developing diffusion models, rather than individual users, to implement (and support) the immunization process. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image blending aims to combine multiple images seamlessly. It remains challenging for existing 2D-based methods, especially when input images are misaligned due to differences in 3D camera poses and object shapes. To tackle these issues, we propose a 3D-aware blending method using generative Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), including two key components: 3D-aware alignment and 3D-aware blending. For 3D-aware alignment, we first estimate the camera pose of the reference image with respect to generative NeRFs and then perform 3D local alignment for each part. To further leverage 3D information of the generative NeRF, we propose 3D-aware blending that directly blends images on the NeRF's latent representation space, rather than raw pixel space. Collectively, our method outperforms existing 2D baselines, as validated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations with FFHQ and AFHQ-Cat. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of cancer that originates in the kidneys and is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: RNA, whose functionality is largely determined by its structure, plays an important role in many biological activities. The prediction of pairwise structural proximity between each nucleotide of an RNA sequence can characterize the structural information of the RNA. Historically, this problem has been tackled by machine learning models using expert-engineered features and trained on scarce labeled datasets. Here, we find that the knowledge learned by a protein-coevolution Transformer-based deep neural network can be transferred to the RNA contact prediction task. As protein datasets are orders of magnitude larger than those for RNA contact prediction, our findings and the subsequent framework greatly reduce the data scarcity bottleneck. Experiments confirm that RNA contact prediction through transfer learning using a publicly available protein model is greatly improved. Our findings indicate that the learned structural patterns of proteins can be transferred to RNAs, opening up potential new avenues for research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Hidden-Markov-model (HMM) based text-to-speech (HTS) offers flexibility in speaking styles along with fast training and synthesis while being computationally less intense. HTS performs well even in low-resource scenarios. The primary drawback is that the voice quality is poor compared to that of E2E systems. A hybrid approach combining HMM-based feature generation and neural-network-based HiFi-GAN vocoder to improve HTS synthesis quality is proposed. HTS is trained on high-resolution mel-spectrograms instead of conventional mel generalized coefficients (MGC), and the output mel-spectrogram corresponding to the input text is used in a HiFi-GAN vocoder trained on Indic languages, to produce naturalness that is equivalent to that of E2E systems, as evidenced from the DMOS and PC tests. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-supervision has shown great potential for audio-visual speech recognition by vastly reducing the amount of labeled data required to build good systems. However, existing methods are either not entirely end-to-end or do not train joint representations of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce AV-data2vec which addresses these challenges and builds audio-visual representations based on predicting contextualized representations which has been successful in the uni-modal case. The model uses a shared transformer encoder for both audio and video and can combine both modalities to improve speech recognition. Results on LRS3 show that AV-data2vec consistently outperforms existing methods under most settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
