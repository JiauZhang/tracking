### [Contrastive Distillation Is a Sample-Efficient Self-Supervised Loss  Policy for Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11353)
Traditional approaches to RL have focused on learning decision policies directly from episodic decisions, while slowly and implicitly learning the semantics of compositional representations needed for generalization. While some approaches have been adopted to refine representations via auxiliary self-supervised losses while simultaneously learning decision policies, learning compositional representations from hand-designed and context-independent self-supervised losses (multi-view) still adapts relatively slowly to the real world, which contains many non-IID subspaces requiring rapid distribution shift in both time and spatial attention patterns at varying levels of abstraction. In contrast, supervised language model cascades have shown the flexibility to adapt to many diverse manifolds, and hints of self-learning needed for autonomous task transfer. However, to date, transfer methods for language models like few-shot learning and fine-tuning still require human supervision and transfer learning using self-learning methods has been underexplored. We propose a self-supervised loss policy called contrastive distillation which manifests latent variables with high mutual information with both source and target tasks from weights to tokens. We show how this outperforms common methods of transfer learning and suggests a useful design axis of trading off compute for generalizability for online transfer. Contrastive distillation is improved through sampling from memory and suggests a simple algorithm for more efficiently sampling negative examples for contrastive losses than random sampling. 

### [Automatic Emotion Modelling in Written Stories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11382)
Telling stories is an integral part of human communication which can evoke emotions and influence the affective states of the audience. Automatically modelling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no labelled benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal annotations for an existing dataset of children's stories annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the originally categorical labels to the valence and arousal space. Leveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing, we propose a set of novel Transformer-based methods for predicting valence and arousal signals over the course of written stories. We explore several strategies for fine-tuning a pretrained ELECTRA model and study the benefits of considering a sentence's context when inferring its emotionality. Moreover, we experiment with additional LSTM and Transformer layers. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of .7338 for valence and .6302 for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the suitability of our proposed approach. Our code and additional annotations are made available at https://github.com/lc0197/emotion_modelling_stories. 

### [ABODE-Net: An Attention-based Deep Learning Model for Non-intrusive  Building Occupancy Detection Using Smart Meter Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11396)
Occupancy information is useful for efficient energy management in the building sector. The massive high-resolution electrical power consumption data collected by smart meters in the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network make it possible to infer buildings' occupancy status in a non-intrusive way. In this paper, we propose a deep leaning model called ABODE-Net which employs a novel Parallel Attention (PA) block for building occupancy detection using smart meter data. The PA block combines the temporal, variable, and channel attention modules in a parallel way to signify important features for occupancy detection. We adopt two smart meter datasets widely used for building occupancy detection in our performance evaluation. A set of state-of-the-art shallow machine learning and deep learning models are included for performance comparison. The results show that ABODE-Net significantly outperforms other models in all experimental cases, which proves its validity as a solution for non-intrusive building occupancy detection. 

### [CAMeMBERT: Cascading Assistant-Mediated Multilingual BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11456)
Large language models having hundreds of millions, and even billions, of parameters have performed extremely well on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Their widespread use and adoption, however, is hindered by the lack of availability and portability of sufficiently large computational resources. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation (KD) technique building on the work of LightMBERT, a student model of multilingual BERT (mBERT). By repeatedly distilling mBERT through increasingly compressed toplayer distilled teacher assistant networks, CAMeMBERT aims to improve upon the time and space complexities of mBERT while keeping loss of accuracy beneath an acceptable threshold. At present, CAMeMBERT has an average accuracy of around 60.1%, which is subject to change after future improvements to the hyperparameters used in fine-tuning. 

### [Confidence-Aware Paced-Curriculum Learning by Label Smoothing for  Surgical Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11511)
Curriculum learning and self-paced learning are the training strategies that gradually feed the samples from easy to more complex. They have captivated increasing attention due to their excellent performance in robotic vision. Most recent works focus on designing curricula based on difficulty levels in input samples or smoothing the feature maps. However, smoothing labels to control the learning utility in a curriculum manner is still unexplored. In this work, we design a paced curriculum by label smoothing (P-CBLS) using paced learning with uniform label smoothing (ULS) for classification tasks and fuse uniform and spatially varying label smoothing (SVLS) for semantic segmentation tasks in a curriculum manner. In ULS and SVLS, a bigger smoothing factor value enforces a heavy smoothing penalty in the true label and limits learning less information. Therefore, we design the curriculum by label smoothing (CBLS). We set a bigger smoothing value at the beginning of training and gradually decreased it to zero to control the model learning utility from lower to higher. We also designed a confidence-aware pacing function and combined it with our CBLS to investigate the benefits of various curricula. The proposed techniques are validated on four robotic surgery datasets of multi-class, multi-label classification, captioning, and segmentation tasks. We also investigate the robustness of our method by corrupting validation data into different severity levels. Our extensive analysis shows that the proposed method improves prediction accuracy and robustness. 

### [Ultra-High-Definition Low-Light Image Enhancement: A Benchmark and  Transformer-Based Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11548)
As the quality of optical sensors improves, there is a need for processing large-scale images. In particular, the ability of devices to capture ultra-high definition (UHD) images and video places new demands on the image processing pipeline. In this paper, we consider the task of low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and introduce a large-scale database consisting of images at 4K and 8K resolution. We conduct systematic benchmarking studies and provide a comparison of current LLIE algorithms. As a second contribution, we introduce LLFormer, a transformer-based low-light enhancement method. The core components of LLFormer are the axis-based multi-head self-attention and cross-layer attention fusion block, which significantly reduces the linear complexity. Extensive experiments on the new dataset and existing public datasets show that LLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that employing existing LLIE methods trained on our benchmark as a pre-processing step significantly improves the performance of downstream tasks, e.g., face detection in low-light conditions. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/LLFormer. 

### [Tune-A-Video: One-Shot Tuning of Image Diffusion Models for  Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11565)
To reproduce the success of text-to-image (T2I) generation, recent works in text-to-video (T2V) generation employ large-scale text-video dataset for fine-tuning. However, such paradigm is computationally expensive. Humans have the amazing ability to learn new visual concepts from just one single exemplar. We hereby study a new T2V generation problem$\unicode{x2014}$One-Shot Video Generation, where only a single text-video pair is presented for training an open-domain T2V generator. Intuitively, we propose to adapt the T2I diffusion model pretrained on massive image data for T2V generation. We make two key observations: 1) T2I models are able to generate images that align well with the verb terms; 2) extending T2I models to generate multiple images concurrently exhibits surprisingly good content consistency. To further learn continuous motion, we propose Tune-A-Video with a tailored Sparse-Causal Attention, which generates videos from text prompts via an efficient one-shot tuning of pretrained T2I diffusion models. Tune-A-Video is capable of producing temporally-coherent videos over various applications such as change of subject or background, attribute editing, style transfer, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method. 

### [DuAT: Dual-Aggregation Transformer Network for Medical Image  Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11677)
Transformer-based models have been widely demonstrated to be successful in computer vision tasks by modelling long-range dependencies and capturing global representations. However, they are often dominated by features of large patterns leading to the loss of local details (e.g., boundaries and small objects), which are critical in medical image segmentation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Dual-Aggregation Transformer Network called DuAT, which is characterized by two innovative designs, namely, the Global-to-Local Spatial Aggregation (GLSA) and Selective Boundary Aggregation (SBA) modules. The GLSA has the ability to aggregate and represent both global and local spatial features, which are beneficial for locating large and small objects, respectively. The SBA module is used to aggregate the boundary characteristic from low-level features and semantic information from high-level features for better preserving boundary details and locating the re-calibration objects. Extensive experiments in six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the segmentation of skin lesion images, and polyps in colonoscopy images. In addition, our approach is more robust than existing methods in various challenging situations such as small object segmentation and ambiguous object boundaries. 

### [Scene-aware Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11684)
Egocentric 3D human pose estimation with a single head-mounted fisheye camera has recently attracted attention due to its numerous applications in virtual and augmented reality. Existing methods still struggle in challenging poses where the human body is highly occluded or is closely interacting with the scene. To address this issue, we propose a scene-aware egocentric pose estimation method that guides the prediction of the egocentric pose with scene constraints. To this end, we propose an egocentric depth estimation network to predict the scene depth map from a wide-view egocentric fisheye camera while mitigating the occlusion of the human body with a depth-inpainting network. Next, we propose a scene-aware pose estimation network that projects the 2D image features and estimated depth map of the scene into a voxel space and regresses the 3D pose with a V2V network. The voxel-based feature representation provides the direct geometric connection between 2D image features and scene geometry, and further facilitates the V2V network to constrain the predicted pose based on the estimated scene geometry. To enable the training of the aforementioned networks, we also generated a synthetic dataset, called EgoGTA, and an in-the-wild dataset based on EgoPW, called EgoPW-Scene. The experimental results of our new evaluation sequences show that the predicted 3D egocentric poses are accurate and physically plausible in terms of human-scene interaction, demonstrating that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. 

### [GENIE: Large Scale Pre-training for Text Generation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11685)
In this paper, we propose a large-scale language pre-training for text GENeration using dIffusion modEl, which is named GENIE. GENIE is a pre-training sequence-to-sequence text generation model which combines Transformer and diffusion. The diffusion model accepts the latent information from the encoder, which is used to guide the denoising of the current time step. After multiple such denoise iterations, the diffusion model can restore the Gaussian noise to the diverse output text which is controlled by the input text. Moreover, such architecture design also allows us to adopt large scale pre-training on the GENIE. We propose a novel pre-training method named continuous paragraph denoise based on the characteristics of the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on the XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Gigaword benchmarks shows that GENIE can achieves comparable performance with various strong baselines, especially after pre-training, the generation quality of GENIE is greatly improved. We have also conduct a lot of experiments on the generation diversity and parameter impact of GENIE. The code for GENIE will be made publicly available. 

### [Timestamp-Supervised Action Segmentation in the Perspective of  Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11694)
Video action segmentation aims to slice the video into several action segments. Recently, timestamp supervision has received much attention due to lower annotation costs. We find the frames near the boundaries of action segments are in the transition region between two consecutive actions and have unclear semantics, which we call ambiguous intervals. Most existing methods iteratively generate pseudo-labels for all frames in each video to train the segmentation model. However, ambiguous intervals are more likely to be assigned with noisy and incorrect pseudo-labels, which leads to performance degradation. We propose a novel framework to train the model under timestamp supervision including the following two parts. First, pseudo-label ensembling generates pseudo-label sequences with ambiguous intervals, where the frames have no pseudo-labels. Second, iterative clustering iteratively propagates the pseudo-labels to the ambiguous intervals by clustering, and thus updates the pseudo-label sequences to train the model. We further introduce a clustering loss, which encourages the features of frames within the same action segment more compact. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method. 

### [TransPath: Learning Heuristics For Grid-Based Pathfinding via  Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11730)
Heuristic search algorithms, e.g. A*, are the commonly used tools for pathfinding on grids, i.e. graphs of regular structure that are widely employed to represent environments in robotics, video games etc. Instance-independent heuristics for grid graphs, e.g. Manhattan distance, do not take the obstacles into account and, thus, the search led by such heuristics performs poorly in the obstacle-rich environments. To this end, we suggest learning the instance-dependent heuristic proxies that are supposed to notably increase the efficiency of the search. The first heuristic proxy we suggest to learn is the correction factor, i.e. the ratio between the instance independent cost-to-go estimate and the perfect one (computed offline at the training phase). Unlike learning the absolute values of the cost-to-go heuristic function, which was known before, when learning the correction factor the knowledge of the instance-independent heuristic is utilized. The second heuristic proxy is the path probability, which indicates how likely the grid cell is lying on the shortest path. This heuristic can be utilized in the Focal Search framework as the secondary heuristic, allowing us to preserve the guarantees on the bounded sub-optimality of the solution. We learn both suggested heuristics in a supervised fashion with the state-of-the-art neural networks containing attention blocks (transformers). We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation on a comprehensive dataset of planning tasks, showing that the suggested techniques i) reduce the computational effort of the A* up to a factor of $4$x while producing the solutions, which costs exceed the costs of the optimal solutions by less than $0.3$% on average; ii) outperform the competitors, which include the conventional techniques from the heuristic search, i.e. weighted A*, as well as the state-of-the-art learnable planners. 

### [A Self-Adjusting Fusion Representation Learning Model for Unaligned  Text-Audio Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11772)
Inter-modal interaction plays an indispensable role in multimodal sentiment analysis. Due to different modalities sequences are usually non-alignment, how to integrate relevant information of each modality to learn fusion representations has been one of the central challenges in multimodal learning. In this paper, a Self-Adjusting Fusion Representation Learning Model (SA-FRLM) is proposed to learn robust crossmodal fusion representations directly from the unaligned text and audio sequences. Different from previous works, our model not only makes full use of the interaction between different modalities but also maximizes the protection of the unimodal characteristics. Specifically, we first employ a crossmodal alignment module to project different modalities features to the same dimension. The crossmodal collaboration attention is then adopted to model the inter-modal interaction between text and audio sequences and initialize the fusion representations. After that, as the core unit of the SA-FRLM, the crossmodal adjustment transformer is proposed to protect original unimodal characteristics. It can dynamically adapt the fusion representations by using single modal streams. We evaluate our approach on the public multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment results show that our model has significantly improved the performance of all the metrics on the unaligned text-audio sequences. 

### [Fixed-budget online adaptive mesh learning for physics-informed neural  networks. Towards parameterized problem inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11776)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in various fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating physical laws into the models. PINNs integrate the physical constraints by minimizing the partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals on a set of collocation points. The distribution of these collocation points appears to have a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the sampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we propose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Mesh Learning (FBOAML) method, which decomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based on local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The stopping criterion is based on a data set of reference, which leads to an adaptive number of iterations for each specific problem. The effectiveness of FBOAML is demonstrated in the context of non-parameterized and parameterized problems. The impact of the hyper-parameters in FBOAML is investigated in this work. The comparison with other adaptive sampling methods is also illustrated. The numerical results demonstrate important gains in terms of accuracy of PINNs with FBOAML over the classical PINNs with non-adaptive collocation points. We also apply FBOAML in a complex industrial application involving coupling between mechanical and thermal fields. We show that FBOAML is able to identify the high-gradient location and even give better prediction for some physical fields than the classical PINNs with collocation points taken on a pre-adapted finite element mesh. 

### [Monocular 3D Object Detection using Multi-Stage Approaches with  Attention and Slicing aided hyper inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11804)
3D object detection is vital as it would enable us to capture objects' sizes, orientation, and position in the world. As a result, we would be able to use this 3D detection in real-world applications such as Augmented Reality (AR), self-driving cars, and robotics which perceive the world the same way we do as humans. Monocular 3D Object Detection is the task to draw 3D bounding box around objects in a single 2D RGB image. It is localization task but without any extra information like depth or other sensors or multiple images. Monocular 3D object detection is an important yet challenging task. Beyond the significant progress in image-based 2D object detection, 3D understanding of real-world objects is an open challenge that has not been explored extensively thus far. In addition to the most closely related studies. 

### [GAN-based Domain Inference Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11810)
Model-based attacks can infer training data information from deep neural network models. These attacks heavily depend on the attacker's knowledge of the application domain, e.g., using it to determine the auxiliary data for model-inversion attacks. However, attackers may not know what the model is used for in practice. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method to explore likely or similar domains of a target model -- the model domain inference (MDI) attack. For a given target (classification) model, we assume that the attacker knows nothing but the input and output formats and can use the model to derive the prediction for any input in the desired form. Our basic idea is to use the target model to affect a GAN training process for a candidate domain's dataset that is easy to obtain. We find that the target model may distract the training procedure less if the domain is more similar to the target domain. We then measure the distraction level with the distance between GAN-generated datasets, which can be used to rank candidate domains for the target model. Our experiments show that the auxiliary dataset from an MDI top-ranked domain can effectively boost the result of model-inversion attacks. 

### [Jamdani Motif Generation using Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11824)
Jamdani is the strikingly patterned textile heritage of Bangladesh. The exclusive geometric motifs woven on the fabric are the most attractive part of this craftsmanship having a remarkable influence on textile and fine art. In this paper, we have developed a technique based on the Generative Adversarial Network that can learn to generate entirely new Jamdani patterns from a collection of Jamdani motifs that we assembled, the newly formed motifs can mimic the appearance of the original designs. Users can input the skeleton of a desired pattern in terms of rough strokes and our system finalizes the input by generating the complete motif which follows the geometric structure of real Jamdani ones. To serve this purpose, we collected and preprocessed a dataset containing a large number of Jamdani motifs images from authentic sources via fieldwork and applied a state-of-the-art method called pix2pix to it. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is currently the only available dataset of Jamdani motifs in digital format for computer vision research. Our experimental results of the pix2pix model on this dataset show satisfactory outputs of computer-generated images of Jamdani motifs and we believe that our work will open a new avenue for further research. 

### [Convergence of particles and tree based scheme for singular FBSDEs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11917)
We study an implementation of the theoretical splitting scheme introduced in [Chassagneux and Yang, 2022] for singular FBSDEs [Carmona and Delarue 2013] and their associated quasi-linear degenerate PDEs. The fully implementable algorithm is based on particles approximation of the transport operator and tree like approximation of the diffusion operator appearing in the theoretical splitting. We prove the convergence with a rate of our numerical method under some reasonable conditions on the coefficients functions. This validates a posteriori some numerical results obtained in [Chassagneux and Yang, 2022]. We conclude the paper with a numerical section presenting various implementations of the algorithm and discussing their efficiency in practice. 

### [Beyond SOT: It's Time to Track Multiple Generic Objects at Once](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11920)
Generic Object Tracking (GOT) is the problem of tracking target objects, specified by bounding boxes in the first frame of a video. While the task has received much attention in the last decades, researchers have almost exclusively focused on the single object setting. Multi-object GOT benefits from a wider applicability, rendering it more attractive in real-world applications. We attribute the lack of research interest into this problem to the absence of suitable benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale GOT benchmark, LaGOT, containing multiple annotated target objects per sequence. Our benchmark allows researchers to tackle key remaining challenges in GOT, aiming to increase robustness and reduce computation through joint tracking of multiple objects simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a Transformer-based GOT tracker TaMOS capable of joint processing of multiple objects through shared computation. TaMOs achieves a 4x faster run-time in case of 10 concurrent objects compared to tracking each object independently and outperforms existing single object trackers on our new benchmark. Finally, TaMOs achieves highly competitive results on single-object GOT datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art on TrackingNet with a success rate AUC of 84.4%. Our benchmark, code, and trained models will be made publicly available. 

### [Removing Objects From Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11966)
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are emerging as a ubiquitous scene representation that allows for novel view synthesis. Increasingly, NeRFs will be shareable with other people. Before sharing a NeRF, though, it might be desirable to remove personal information or unsightly objects. Such removal is not easily achieved with the current NeRF editing frameworks. We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent. We show that our method for NeRF editing is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view coherent manner. We validate our approach using a new and still-challenging dataset for the task of NeRF inpainting. 

### [Scalable Adaptive Computation for Iterative Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11972)
We present the Recurrent Interface Network (RIN), a neural net architecture that allocates computation adaptively to the input according to the distribution of information, allowing it to scale to iterative generation of high-dimensional data. Hidden units of RINs are partitioned into the interface, which is locally connected to inputs, and latents, which are decoupled from inputs and can exchange information globally. The RIN block selectively reads from the interface into latents for high-capacity processing, with incremental updates written back to the interface. Stacking multiple blocks enables effective routing across local and global levels. While routing adds overhead, the cost can be amortized in recurrent computation settings where inputs change gradually while more global context persists, such as iterative generation using diffusion models. To this end, we propose a latent self-conditioning technique that "warm-starts" the latents at each iteration of the generation process. When applied to diffusion models operating directly on pixels, RINs yield state-of-the-art image and video generation without cascades or guidance, while being domain-agnostic and up to 10$\times$ more efficient compared to specialized 2D and 3D U-Nets. 

### [SPIRiT-Diffusion: SPIRiT-driven Score-Based Generative Modeling for  Vessel Wall imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11274)
Diffusion model is the most advanced method in image generation and has been successfully applied to MRI reconstruction. However, the existing methods do not consider the characteristics of multi-coil acquisition of MRI data. Therefore, we give a new diffusion model, called SPIRiT-Diffusion, based on the SPIRiT iterative reconstruction algorithm. Specifically, SPIRiT-Diffusion characterizes the prior distribution of coil-by-coil images by score matching and characterizes the k-space redundant prior between coils based on self-consistency. With sufficient prior constraint utilized, we achieve superior reconstruction results on the joint Intracranial and Carotid Vessel Wall imaging dataset. 

### [Semi-supervised GAN for Bladder Tissue Classification in Multi-Domain  Endoscopic Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11375)
Objective: Accurate visual classification of bladder tissue during Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) procedures is essential to improve early cancer diagnosis and treatment. During TURBT interventions, White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) techniques are used for lesion detection. Each imaging technique provides diverse visual information that allows clinicians to identify and classify cancerous lesions. Computer vision methods that use both imaging techniques could improve endoscopic diagnosis. We address the challenge of tissue classification when annotations are available only in one domain, in our case WLI, and the endoscopic images correspond to an unpaired dataset, i.e. there is no exact equivalent for every image in both NBI and WLI domains. Method: We propose a semi-surprised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method composed of three main components: a teacher network trained on the labeled WLI data; a cycle-consistency GAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, and a multi-input student network. To ensure the quality of the synthetic images generated by the proposed GAN we perform a detailed quantitative, and qualitative analysis with the help of specialists. Conclusion: The overall average classification accuracy, precision, and recall obtained with the proposed method for tissue classification are 0.90, 0.88, and 0.89 respectively, while the same metrics obtained in the unlabeled domain (NBI) are 0.92, 0.64, and 0.94 respectively. The quality of the generated images is reliable enough to deceive specialists. Significance: This study shows the potential of using semi-supervised GAN-based classification to improve bladder tissue classification when annotations are limited in multi-domain data. 

### [Online Statistical Inference for Matrix Contextual Bandit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11385)
Contextual bandit has been widely used for sequential decision-making based on the current contextual information and historical feedback data. In modern applications, such context format can be rich and can often be formulated as a matrix. Moreover, while existing bandit algorithms mainly focused on reward-maximization, less attention has been paid to the statistical inference. To fill in these gaps, in this work we consider a matrix contextual bandit framework where the true model parameter is a low-rank matrix, and propose a fully online procedure to simultaneously make sequential decision-making and conduct statistical inference. The low-rank structure of the model parameter and the adaptivity nature of the data collection process makes this difficult: standard low-rank estimators are not fully online and are biased, while existing inference approaches in bandit algorithms fail to account for the low-rankness and are also biased. To address these, we introduce a new online doubly-debiasing inference procedure to simultaneously handle both sources of bias. In theory, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed online doubly-debiased estimator and prove the validity of the constructed confidence interval. Our inference results are built upon a newly developed low-rank stochastic gradient descent estimator and its non-asymptotic convergence result, which is also of independent interest. 

### [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Network for High  Resolution Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11614)
Quantum machine learning (QML) has received increasing attention due to its potential to outperform classical machine learning methods in various problems. A subclass of QML methods is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) which have been studied as a quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used in image manipulation and generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still limited to small-scale proof-of-concept examples based on images with significant down-scaling. Here we integrate classical and quantum techniques to propose a new hybrid quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its superior learning capabilities by generating $28 \times 28$ pixels grey-scale images without dimensionality reduction or classical pre/post-processing on multiple classes of the standard MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, which achieves comparable results to classical frameworks with 3 orders of magnitude less trainable generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working of our hybrid approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter space by varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of layers in the generator, the shape of the patches and the choice of prior distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal parameter set tailored for complex image generation tasks. 

### [Predicting Companies' ESG Ratings from News Articles Using Multivariate  Timeseries Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11765)
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) engagement of companies moved into the focus of public attention over recent years. With the requirements of compulsory reporting being implemented and investors incorporating sustainability in their investment decisions, the demand for transparent and reliable ESG ratings is increasing. However, automatic approaches for forecasting ESG ratings have been quite scarce despite the increasing importance of the topic. In this paper, we build a model to predict ESG ratings from news articles using the combination of multivariate timeseries construction and deep learning techniques. A news dataset for about 3,000 US companies together with their ratings is also created and released for training. Through the experimental evaluation we find out that our approach provides accurate results outperforming the state-of-the-art, and can be used in practice to support a manual determination or analysis of ESG ratings. 

### [Fully 3D Implementation of the End-to-end Deep Image Prior-based PET  Image Reconstruction Using Block Iterative Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11844)
Deep image prior (DIP) has recently attracted attention owing to its unsupervised positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction, which does not require any prior training dataset. In this paper, we present the first attempt to implement an end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction method that incorporates a forward-projection model into a loss function. To implement a practical fully 3D PET image reconstruction, which could not be performed due to a graphics processing unit memory limitation, we modify the DIP optimization to block-iteration and sequentially learn an ordered sequence of block sinograms. Furthermore, the relative difference penalty (RDP) term was added to the loss function to enhance the quantitative PET image accuracy. We evaluated our proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation with [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data of a human brain and a preclinical study on monkey brain [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data. The proposed method was compared with the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (EM), maximum-a-posterior EM with RDP, and hybrid DIP-based PET reconstruction methods. The simulation results showed that the proposed method improved the PET image quality by reducing statistical noise and preserved a contrast of brain structures and inserted tumor compared with other algorithms. In the preclinical experiment, finer structures and better contrast recovery were obtained by the proposed method. This indicated that the proposed method can produce high-quality images without a prior training dataset. Thus, the proposed method is a key enabling technology for the straightforward and practical implementation of end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction. 

### [StoRM: A Diffusion-based Stochastic Regeneration Model for Speech  Enhancement and Dereverberation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11851)
Diffusion models have shown a great ability at bridging the performance gap between predictive and generative approaches for speech enhancement. We have shown that they may even outperform their predictive counterparts for non-additive corruption types or when they are evaluated on mismatched conditions. However, diffusion models suffer from a high computational burden, mainly as they require to run a neural network for each reverse diffusion step, whereas predictive approaches only require one pass. As diffusion models are generative approaches they may also produce vocalizing and breathing artifacts in adverse conditions. In comparison, in such difficult scenarios, predictive models typically do not produce such artifacts but tend to distort the target speech instead, thereby degrading the speech quality. In this work, we present a stochastic regeneration approach where an estimate given by a predictive model is provided as a guide for further diffusion. We show that the proposed approach uses the predictive model to remove the vocalizing and breathing artifacts while producing very high quality samples thanks to the diffusion model, even in adverse conditions. We further show that this approach enables to use lighter sampling schemes with fewer diffusion steps without sacrificing quality, thus lifting the computational burden by an order of magnitude.

### [Green's function estimates for a 2d singularly perturbed  convection-diffusion problem: extended analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11916)
This paper presents an extended version of the article [Franz, S., Kopteva, N.: J. Differential Equations, 252 (2012)]. The main improvement compared to the latter is in that here we additionally estimate the mixed second-order derivative of the Green's function. The case of Neumann conditions along the characteristic boundaries is also addressed. A singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problem is posed in the unit square with a horizontal convective direction. Its solutions exhibit parabolic and exponential boundary layers. Sharp estimates of the Green's function and its first- and second-order derivatives are derived in the $L_1$ norm. The dependence of these estimates on the small diffusion parameter is shown explicitly. The obtained estimates will be used in a forthcoming numerical analysis of the considered problem.
