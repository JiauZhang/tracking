        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The surrogate loss of variational autoencoders (VAEs) poses various challenges to their training, inducing the imbalance between task fitting and representation inference. To avert this, the existing strategies for VAEs focus on adjusting the tradeoff by introducing hyperparameters, deriving a tighter bound under some mild assumptions, or decomposing the loss components per certain neural settings. VAEs still suffer from uncertain tradeoff learning.We propose a novel evolutionary variational autoencoder (eVAE) building on the variational information bottleneck (VIB) theory and integrative evolutionary neural learning. eVAE integrates a variational genetic algorithm into VAE with variational evolutionary operators including variational mutation, crossover, and evolution. Its inner-outer-joint training mechanism synergistically and dynamically generates and updates the uncertain tradeoff learning in the evidence lower bound (ELBO) without additional constraints. Apart from learning a lossy compression and representation of data under the VIB assumption, eVAE presents an evolutionary paradigm to tune critical factors of VAEs and deep neural networks and addresses the premature convergence and random search problem by integrating evolutionary optimization into deep learning. Experiments show that eVAE addresses the KL-vanishing problem for text generation with low reconstruction loss, generates all disentangled factors with sharp images, and improves the image generation quality,respectively. eVAE achieves better reconstruction loss, disentanglement, and generation-inference balance than its competitors. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored, with applications in gaming, character animation, virtual reality, and telepresence systems. State-of-the-art methods deform the face topology of the target actor to sync the input audio without considering the identity-specific speaking style and facial idiosyncrasies of the target actor, thus, resulting in unrealistic and inaccurate lip movements. To address this, we present Imitator, a speech-driven facial expression synthesis method, which learns identity-specific details from a short input video and produces novel facial expressions matching the identity-specific speaking style and facial idiosyncrasies of the target actor. Specifically, we train a style-agnostic transformer on a large facial expression dataset which we use as a prior for audio-driven facial expressions. Based on this prior, we optimize for identity-specific speaking style based on a short reference video. To train the prior, we introduce a novel loss function based on detected bilabial consonants to ensure plausible lip closures and consequently improve the realism of the generated expressions. Through detailed experiments and a user study, we show that our approach produces temporally coherent facial expressions from input audio while preserving the speaking style of the target actors. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work addresses an alternative approach for query expansion (QE) using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance the effectiveness of information search in e-commerce. We propose a modified QE conditional GAN (mQE-CGAN) framework, which resolves keywords by expanding the query with a synthetically generated query that proposes semantic information from text input. We train a sequence-to-sequence transformer model as the generator to produce keywords and use a recurrent neural network model as the discriminator to classify an adversarial output with the generator. With the modified CGAN framework, various forms of semantic insights gathered from the query document corpus are introduced to the generation process. We leverage these insights as conditions for the generator model and discuss their effectiveness for the query expansion task. Our experiments demonstrate that the utilization of condition structures within the mQE-CGAN framework can increase the semantic similarity between generated sequences and reference documents up to nearly 10% compared to baseline models <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent studies have shown that using an external Language Model (LM) benefits the end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, predicting tokens that appear less frequently in the training set is still quite challenging. The long-tail prediction problems have been widely studied in many applications, but only been addressed by a few studies for ASR and LMs. In this paper, we propose a new memory augmented lookup dictionary based Transformer architecture for LM. The newly introduced lookup dictionary incorporates rich contextual information in training set, which is vital to correctly predict long-tail tokens. With intensive experiments on Chinese and English data sets, our proposed method is proved to outperform the baseline Transformer LM by a great margin on both word/character error rate and tail tokens error rate. This is achieved without impact on the decoding efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in boosting the ASR decoding performance, especially for long-tail tokens. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Bipedal robots have received much attention because of the variety of motion maneuvers that they can produce, and the many applications they have in various areas including rehabilitation. One of these motion maneuvers is walking. In this study, we presented a framework for the trajectory optimization of a 5-link (planar) Biped Robot using hybrid optimization. The walking is modeled with two phases of single-stance (support) phase and the collision phase. The dynamic equations of the robot in each phase are extracted by the Lagrange method. It is assumed that the robot heel strike to the ground is full plastic. The gait is optimized with a method called hybrid optimization. The objective function of this problem is considered to be the integral of torque-squared along the trajectory, and also various constraints such as zero dynamics are satisfied without any approximation. Furthermore, in a new framework, there is presented a constraint called impact invariance, which ensures the periodicity of the time-varying trajectories. On the other hand, other constraints provide better and more human-like movement. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Covid-19 has grown rapidly in all parts of the world and is considered an international disaster because of its wide-reaching impact. The impact of Covid-19 has spread to Indonesia, especially in the slowdown in economic growth. This was influenced by the implementation of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) which limited community economic activities. This study aims to analyze the mapping of public sentiment towards PPKM policies in Indonesia during the pandemic based on Twitter data. Knowing the mapping of public sentiment regarding PPKM is expected to help stakeholders in the policy evaluation process for each region. The method used is BERT with IndoBERT specific model. The results showed the evaluation value of IndoBERT f-1 score reached 84%, precision 86%, and recall 84%. Meanwhile for the evaluation of the use of SVM f-1 score 70%, 72% precision, and 70% recall. Multinominal Na\"ive Bayes evaluation shows f-1 score 83%, precision 78%, and recall 80%. As a conclusion, BERT method with the IndoBERT model is proven to be higher than classical methods such as SVM and Multinominal Na\"ive Bayes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Audio-Visual scene understanding is a challenging problem due to the unstructured spatial-temporal relations that exist in the audio signals and spatial layouts of different objects and various texture patterns in the visual images. Recently, many studies have focused on abstracting features from convolutional neural networks while the learning of explicit semantically relevant frames of sound signals and visual images has been overlooked. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework, namely attentional graph convolutional network (AGCN), for structure-aware audio-visual scene representation. First, the spectrogram of sound and input image is processed by a backbone network for feature extraction. Then, to build multi-scale hierarchical information of input features, we utilize an attention fusion mechanism to aggregate features from multiple layers of the backbone network. Notably, to well represent the salient regions and contextual information of audio-visual inputs, the salient acoustic graph (SAG) and contextual acoustic graph (CAG), salient visual graph (SVG), and contextual visual graph (CVG) are constructed for the audio-visual scene representation. Finally, the constructed graphs pass through a graph convolutional network for structure-aware audio-visual scene recognition. Extensive experimental results on the audio, visual and audio-visual scene recognition datasets show that promising results have been achieved by the AGCN methods. Visualizing graphs on the spectrograms and images have been presented to show the effectiveness of proposed CAG/SAG and CVG/SVG that could focus on the salient and semantic relevant regions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent investigations on rotation invariance for 3D point clouds have been devoted to devising rotation-invariant feature descriptors or learning canonical spaces where objects are semantically aligned. Examinations of learning frameworks for invariance have seldom been looked into. In this work, we review rotation invariance in terms of point cloud registration and propose an effective framework for rotation invariance learning via three sequential stages, namely rotation-invariant shape encoding, aligned feature integration, and deep feature registration. We first encode shape descriptors constructed with respect to reference frames defined over different scales, e.g., local patches and global topology, to generate rotation-invariant latent shape codes. Within the integration stage, we propose Aligned Integration Transformer to produce a discriminative feature representation by integrating point-wise self- and cross-relations established within the shape codes. Meanwhile, we adopt rigid transformations between reference frames to align the shape codes for feature consistency across different scales. Finally, the deep integrated feature is registered to both rotation-invariant shape codes to maximize feature similarities, such that rotation invariance of the integrated feature is preserved and shared semantic information is implicitly extracted from shape codes. Experimental results on 3D shape classification, part segmentation, and retrieval tasks prove the feasibility of our work.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multiple studies have focused on predicting the prospective popularity of an online document as a whole, without paying attention to the contributions of its individual parts. We introduce the task of proactively forecasting popularities of sentences within online news documents solely utilizing their natural language content. We model sentence-specific popularity forecasting as a sequence regression task. For training our models, we curate InfoPop, the first dataset containing popularity labels for over 1.7 million sentences from over 50,000 online news documents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset automatically created using streams of incoming search engine queries to generate sentence-level popularity annotations. We propose a novel transfer learning approach involving sentence salience prediction as an auxiliary task. Our proposed technique coupled with a BERT-based neural model exceeds nDCG values of 0.8 for proactive sentence-specific popularity forecasting. Notably, our study presents a non-trivial takeaway: though popularity and salience are different concepts, transfer learning from salience prediction enhances popularity forecasting. We release InfoPop and make our code publicly available: https://github.com/sayarghoshroy/InfoPopularity <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Vision-language models (VLMs) that are pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive transferability on a wide range of visual tasks. Transferring knowledge from such powerful pre-trained VLMs is emerging as a promising direction for building effective video recognition models. However, the current exploration is still limited. In our opinion, the greatest charm of pre-trained vision-language models is to build a bridge between visual and textual domains. In this paper, we present a novel framework called BIKE which utilizes the cross-modal bridge to explore bidirectional knowledge: i) We propose a Video Attribute Association mechanism which leverages the Video-to-Text knowledge to generate textual auxiliary attributes to complement video recognition. ii) We also present a Temporal Concept Spotting mechanism which uses the Text-to-Video expertise to capture temporal saliency in a parameter-free manner to yield enhanced video representation. The extensive studies on popular video datasets (ie, Kinetics-400 &amp; 600, UCF-101, HMDB-51 and ActivityNet) show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in most recognition scenarios, eg, general, zero-shot, and few-shot video recognition. To the best of our knowledge, our best model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.4% on challenging Kinetics-400 with the released CLIP pre-trained model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most existing text-video retrieval methods focus on cross-modal matching between the visual content of offline videos and textual query sentences. However, in real scenarios, online videos are frequently accompanied by relevant text information such as titles, tags, and even subtitles, which can be utilized to match textual queries. This inspires us to generate associated captions from offline videos to help with existing text-video retrieval methods. To do so, we propose to use the zero-shot video captioner with knowledge of pre-trained web-scale models (e.g., CLIP and GPT-2) to generate captions for offline videos without any training. Given the captions, one question naturally arises: what can auxiliary captions do for text-video retrieval? In this paper, we present a novel framework Cap4Video, which makes use of captions from three aspects: i) Input data: The video and captions can form new video-caption pairs as data augmentation for training. ii) Feature interaction: We perform feature interaction between video and caption to yield enhanced video representations. iii) Output score: The Query-Caption matching branch can be complementary to the original Query-Video matching branch for text-video retrieval. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Without any post-processing, our Cap4Video achieves state-of-the-art performance on MSR-VTT (51.4%), VATEX (66.6%), MSVD (51.8%), and DiDeMo (52.0%). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) via deep learning has attracted appealing attention for tackling domain-shift problems caused by distribution discrepancy across different domains. Existing UDA approaches highly depend on the accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical scenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and computation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge transfer from a pre-trained source model to unlabeled target domain with source data inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great significance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature review of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e., white-box SFUDA and black-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on different learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of methods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box and black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and summarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models learned without using source data. We finally discuss several promising future directions in this field. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite some successful applications of goal-driven navigation, existing deep reinforcement learning-based approaches notoriously suffers from poor data efficiency issue. One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled from the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of decision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene representation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light of this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement learning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of the scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal information and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically, we propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the perception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with expert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the goal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating decision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation to concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances the data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation performance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the superiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance, robustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-art baselines.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Cashews are grown by over 3 million smallholders in more than 40 countries worldwide as a principal source of income. As the third largest cashew producer in Africa, Benin has nearly 200,000 smallholder cashew growers contributing 15% of the country's national export earnings. However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy of 80% and the CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 77.9%. We found that the cashew area in Benin has doubled from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 70%.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper proposes a novel self-supervised based Cut-and-Paste GAN to perform foreground object segmentation and generate realistic composite images without manual annotations. We accomplish this goal by a simple yet effective self-supervised approach coupled with the U-Net based discriminator. The proposed method extends the ability of the standard discriminators to learn not only the global data representations via classification (real/fake) but also learn semantic and structural information through pseudo labels created using the self-supervised task. The proposed method empowers the generator to create meaningful masks by forcing it to learn informative per-pixel as well as global image feedback from the discriminator. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural models with an encoder-decoder framework provide a feasible solution to Question Generation (QG). However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we find that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than 23\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate embeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and parameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant noise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation. Firstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder, and replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to the repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of the following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question word, copying a word from the source sequence or generating a word transformation type. Such extension can greatly decrease the size of predicted words in the decoder as well as noise. We apply our approach to a typical RNN-based model and \textsc{UniLM} to get the improved versions. We conduct extensive experiments on SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets. The experimental results show that the improved versions can significantly outperform the corresponding baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE-L and METEOR as well as time cost. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Brain midline shift (MLS) is one of the most critical factors to be considered for clinical diagnosis and treatment decision-making for intracranial hemorrhage. Existing computational methods on MLS quantification not only require intensive labeling in millimeter-level measurement but also suffer from poor performance due to their dependence on specific landmarks or simplified anatomical assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework to accurately measure the scale of MLS from head CT scans. We formulate the MLS measurement task as a deformation estimation problem and solve it using a few MLS slices with sparse labels. Meanwhile, with the help of diffusion models, we are able to use a great number of unlabeled MLS data and 2793 non-MLS cases for representation learning and regularization. The extracted representation reflects how the image is different from a non-MLS image and regularization serves an important role in the sparse-to-dense refinement of the deformation field. Our experiment on a real clinical brain hemorrhage dataset has achieved state-of-the-art performance and can generate interpretable deformation fields. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Representing and synthesizing novel views in real-world dynamic scenes from casual monocular videos is a long-standing problem. Existing solutions typically approach dynamic scenes by applying geometry techniques or utilizing temporal information between several adjacent frames without considering the underlying background distribution in the entire scene or the transmittance over the ray dimension, limiting their performance on static and occlusion areas. Our approach $\textbf{D}$istribution-$\textbf{D}$riven neural radiance fields offers high-quality view synthesis and a 3D solution to $\textbf{D}$etach the background from the entire $\textbf{D}$ynamic scene, which is called $\text{D}^4$NeRF. Specifically, it employs a neural representation to capture the scene distribution in the static background and a 6D-input NeRF to represent dynamic objects, respectively. Each ray sample is given an additional occlusion weight to indicate the transmittance lying in the static and dynamic components. We evaluate $\text{D}^4$NeRF on public dynamic scenes and our urban driving scenes acquired from an autonomous-driving dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in rendering texture details and motion areas while also producing a clean static background.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: RTE is a significant problem and is a reasonably active research community. The proposed research works on the approach to this problem are pretty diverse with many different directions. For Vietnamese, the RTE problem is moderately new, but this problem plays a vital role in natural language understanding systems. Currently, methods to solve this problem based on contextual word representation learning models have given outstanding results. However, Vietnamese is a semantically rich language. Therefore, in this paper, we want to present an experiment combining semantic word representation through the SRL task with context representation of BERT relative models for the RTE problem. The experimental results give conclusions about the influence and role of semantic representation on Vietnamese in understanding natural language. The experimental results show that the semantic-aware contextual representation model has about 1% higher performance than the model that does not incorporate semantic representation. In addition, the effects on the data domain in Vietnamese are also higher than those in English. This result also shows the positive influence of SRL on RTE problem in Vietnamese. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning the underlying distribution of molecular graphs and generating high-fidelity samples is a fundamental research problem in drug discovery and material science. However, accurately modeling distribution and rapidly generating novel molecular graphs remain crucial and challenging goals. To accomplish these goals, we propose a novel Conditional Diffusion model based on discrete Graph Structures (CDGS) for molecular graph generation. Specifically, we construct a forward graph diffusion process on both graph structures and inherent features through stochastic differential equations (SDE) and derive discrete graph structures as the condition for reverse generative processes. We present a specialized hybrid graph noise prediction model that extracts the global context and the local node-edge dependency from intermediate graph states. We further utilize ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers for efficient graph sampling, based on the semi-linear structure of the probability flow ODE. Experiments on diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, the proposed method still generates high-quality molecular graphs in a limited number of steps. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Extracting complex structures from grid-based data is a common key step in automated medical image analysis. The conventional solution to recovering tree-structured geometries typically involves computing the minimal cost path through intermediate representations derived from segmentation masks. However, this methodology has significant limitations in the context of projective imaging of tree-structured 3D anatomical data such as coronary arteries, since there are often overlapping branches in the 2D projection. In this work, we propose a novel approach to predicting tree connectivity structure which reformulates the task as an optimization problem over individual steps of a recursive process. We design and train a two-stage model which leverages the UNet and Transformer architectures and introduces an image-based prompting technique. Our proposed method achieves compelling results on a pair of synthetic datasets, and outperforms a shortest-path baseline. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we learn a diffusion model to generate 3D data on a scene-scale. Specifically, our model crafts a 3D scene consisting of multiple objects, while recent diffusion research has focused on a single object. To realize our goal, we represent a scene with discrete class labels, i.e., categorical distribution, to assign multiple objects into semantic categories. Thus, we extend discrete diffusion models to learn scene-scale categorical distributions. In addition, we validate that a latent diffusion model can reduce computation costs for training and deploying. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply discrete and latent diffusion for 3D categorical data on a scene-scale. We further propose to perform semantic scene completion (SSC) by learning a conditional distribution using our diffusion model, where the condition is a partial observation in a sparse point cloud. In experiments, we empirically show that our diffusion models not only generate reasonable scenes, but also perform the scene completion task better than a discriminative model.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, the Transformer architecture has shown its superiority in the video-based person re-identification task. Inspired by video representation learning, these methods mainly focus on designing modules to extract informative spatial and temporal features. However, they are still limited in extracting local attributes and global identity information, which are critical for the person re-identification task. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Stage Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Transformer (MSTAT) with two novel designed proxy embedding modules to address the above issue. Specifically, MSTAT consists of three stages to encode the attribute-associated, the identity-associated, and the attribute-identity-associated information from the video clips, respectively, achieving the holistic perception of the input person. We combine the outputs of all the stages for the final identification. In practice, to save the computational cost, the Spatial-Temporal Aggregation (STA) modules are first adopted in each stage to conduct the self-attention operations along the spatial and temporal dimensions separately. We further introduce the Attribute-Aware and Identity-Aware Proxy embedding modules (AAP and IAP) to extract the informative and discriminative feature representations at different stages. All of them are realized by employing newly designed self-attention operations with specific meanings. Moreover, temporal patch shuffling is also introduced to further improve the robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in extracting the informative and discriminative information from the videos, and illustrate the MSTAT can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies on various standard benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Flow-level network measurement is critical to many network applications. Among various measurement tasks, packet loss detection and heavy-hitter detection are two most important measurement tasks, which we call the two key tasks. In practice, the two key tasks are often required at the same time, but existing works seldom handle both tasks. In this paper, we design ChameleMon to support the two key tasks simultaneously. One key design/novelty of ChameleMon is to shift measurement attention as network state changes, through two dimensions of dynamics: 1) dynamically allocating memory between the two key tasks; 2) dynamically monitoring the flows of importance. To realize the key design, we propose a key technique, leveraging Fermat's little theorem to devise a flexible data structure, namely FermatSketch. FermatSketch is dividable, additive, and subtractive, supporting the two key tasks. We have fully implemented a ChameleMon prototype on a testbed with a Fat-tree topology. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show ChameleMon supports the two key tasks with low memory/bandwidth overhead, and more importantly, it can automatically shift measurement attention as network state changes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Scalable methods for scoring written responses are needed as students migrate to online learning environments resulting in the need to evaluate large numbers of written-response assessments. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate three active learning methods than can be used to minimize the number of essays that must be scored by human raters while still providing the data needed to train a modern automated essay scoring system. The three active learning methods are the uncertainty-based, the topological-based, and the hybrid method. These three methods were used to select essays included as part of the Automated Student Assessment Prize competition that were then classified using a scoring model that was training with the bidirectional encoder representations from transformer language model. All three active learning methods produced strong results, with the topological-based method producing the most efficient classification. Growth rate accuracy was also evaluated. The active learning methods produced different levels of efficiency under different sample size allocations but, overall, all three methods were highly efficient and produced classifications that were similar to one another. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Agents that can follow language instructions are expected to be useful in a variety of situations such as navigation. However, training neural network-based agents requires numerous paired trajectories and languages. This paper proposes using multimodal generative models for semi-supervised learning in the instruction following tasks. The models learn a shared representation of the paired data, and enable semi-supervised learning by reconstructing unpaired data through the representation. Key challenges in applying the models to sequence-to-sequence tasks including instruction following are learning a shared representation of variable-length mulitimodal data and incorporating attention mechanisms. To address the problems, this paper proposes a novel network architecture to absorb the difference in the sequence lengths of the multimodal data. In addition, to further improve the performance, this paper shows how to incorporate the generative model-based approach with an existing semi-supervised method called a speaker-follower model, and proposes a regularization term that improves inference using unpaired trajectories. Experiments on BabyAI and Room-to-Room (R2R) environments show that the proposed method improves the performance of instruction following by leveraging unpaired data, and improves the performance of the speaker-follower model by 2\% to 4\% in R2R. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The machine translation mechanism translates texts automatically between different natural languages, and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has gained attention for its rational context analysis and fluent translation accuracy. However, processing low-resource languages that lack relevant training attributes like supervised data is a current challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP). We incorporated a technique known Active Learning with the NMT toolkit Joey NMT to reach sufficient accuracy and robust predictions of low-resource language translation. With active learning, a semi-supervised machine learning strategy, the training algorithm determines which unlabeled data would be the most beneficial for obtaining labels using selected query techniques. We implemented two model-driven acquisition functions for selecting the samples to be validated. This work uses transformer-based NMT systems; baseline model (BM), fully trained model (FTM) , active learning least confidence based model (ALLCM), and active learning margin sampling based model (ALMSM) when translating English to Hindi. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric has been used to evaluate system results. The BLEU scores of BM, FTM, ALLCM and ALMSM systems are 16.26, 22.56 , 24.54, and 24.20, respectively. The findings in this paper demonstrate that active learning techniques helps the model to converge early and improve the overall quality of the translation system. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present Muse, a text-to-image Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance while being significantly more efficient than diffusion or autoregressive models. Muse is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space: given the text embedding extracted from a pre-trained large language model (LLM), Muse is trained to predict randomly masked image tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requiring fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models, such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM enables fine-grained language understanding, translating to high-fidelity image generation and the understanding of visual concepts such as objects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinality etc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a new SOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. The Muse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of 7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with a CLIP score of 0.32.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) in computer vision are primarily comparative, whose goal is to preserve invariant and discriminative semantics in latent representations by comparing siamese image views. However, the preserved high-level semantics do not contain enough local information, which is vital in medical image analysis (e.g., image-based diagnosis and tumor segmentation). To mitigate the locality problem of comparative SSL, we propose to incorporate the task of pixel restoration for explicitly encoding more pixel-level information into high-level semantics. We also address the preservation of scale information, a powerful tool in aiding image understanding but has not drawn much attention in SSL. The resulting framework can be formulated as a multi-task optimization problem on the feature pyramid. Specifically, we conduct multi-scale pixel restoration and siamese feature comparison in the pyramid. In addition, we propose non-skip U-Net to build the feature pyramid and develop sub-crop to replace multi-crop in 3D medical imaging. The proposed unified SSL framework (PCRLv2) surpasses its self-supervised counterparts on various tasks, including brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2018), chest pathology identification (ChestX-ray, CheXpert), pulmonary nodule detection (LUNA), and abdominal organ segmentation (LiTS), sometimes outperforming them by large margins with limited annotations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We show for the first time that large-scale generative pretrained transformer (GPT) family models can be pruned to at least 50% sparsity in one-shot, without any retraining, at minimal loss of accuracy. This is achieved via a new pruning method called SparseGPT, specifically designed to work efficiently and accurately on massive GPT-family models. When executing SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, we can reach 60% sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time. SparseGPT generalizes to semi-structured (2:4 and 4:8) patterns, and is compatible with weight quantization approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we focus on instance-level open vocabulary segmentation, intending to expand a segmenter for instance-wise novel categories without mask annotations. We investigate a simple yet effective framework with the help of image captions, focusing on exploiting thousands of object nouns in captions to discover instances of novel classes. Rather than adopting pretrained caption models or using massive caption datasets with complex pipelines, we propose an end-to-end solution from two aspects: caption grounding and caption generation. In particular, we devise a joint Caption Grounding and Generation (CGG) framework based on a Mask Transformer baseline. The framework has a novel grounding loss that performs explicit and implicit multi-modal feature alignments. We further design a lightweight caption generation head to allow for additional caption supervision. We find that grounding and generation complement each other, significantly enhancing the segmentation performance for novel categories. We conduct extensive experiments on the COCO dataset with two settings: Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (OVIS) and Open Set Panoptic Segmentation (OSPS). The results demonstrate the superiority of our CGG framework over previous OVIS methods, achieving a large improvement of 6.8% mAP on novel classes without extra caption data. Our method also achieves over 15% PQ improvements for novel classes on the OSPS benchmark under various settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning has been widely used for protein engineering. However, it is limited by the lack of sufficient experimental data to train an accurate model for predicting the functional fitness of high-order mutants. Here, we develop SESNet, a supervised deep-learning model to predict the fitness for protein mutants by leveraging both sequence and structure information, and exploiting attention mechanism. Our model integrates local evolutionary context from homologous sequences, the global evolutionary context encoding rich semantic from the universal protein sequence space and the structure information accounting for the microenvironment around each residue in a protein. We show that SESNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for predicting the sequence-function relationship on 26 deep mutational scanning datasets. More importantly, we propose a data augmentation strategy by leveraging the data from unsupervised models to pre-train our model. After that, our model can achieve strikingly high accuracy in prediction of the fitness of protein mutants, especially for the higher order variants (&gt; 4 mutation sites), when finetuned by using only a small number of experimental mutation data (&lt;50). The strategy proposed is of great practical value as the required experimental effort, i.e., producing a few tens of experimental mutation data on a given protein, is generally affordable by an ordinary biochemical group and can be applied on almost any protein. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Oil products are the main source of energy in the world today. Distribution of these products is one of the main issues in the industry. The main tools for this work are pipelines, and along with it, railways, shipping and roads are also used. Optimal planning of pipelines is an example of decision-making problem and was the focus of many researchers in the past years. The use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the efficient methods to solve this problem. However, models still ignore important operational challenges. Vulnerability to deal with incidents as well as lack of attention to other transportation methods as a complement to the pipeline are among the weak points of the existing models. In this research, we intend to facilitate the decision-making process for experts in the field of distribution of oil products. For this purpose, we must improve the existing MILP methods and modify them for use in the real operational environment in such a way that sufficient flexibility, the possibility of responding to incidents, and the ability to revise the program are added to them. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Outbreaks are complex multi-scale processes that are impacted not only by cellular dynamics and the ability of pathogens to effectively reproduce and spread, but also by population-level dynamics and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. A timely exchange of information related to the spread of novel pathogens, stay-at-home orders, and other containment measures can be effective at containing an infectious disease, particularly during in the early stages when testing infrastructure, vaccines, and other medical interventions may not be available at scale. Using a multiplex epidemic model that consists of an information layer (modeling information exchange between individuals) and a spatially embedded epidemic layer (representing a human contact network), we study how random and targeted disruptions in the information layer (\eg, errors and intentional attacks on communication infrastructure) impact outbreak dynamics. We calibrate our model to the early outbreak stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. Mitigation campaign can still be effective under random disruptions, such as failure of information channels between a few individuals. However, targeted disruptions or sabotage of hub nodes that exchange information with a large number of individuals can abruptly change outbreak characteristics such as the time to reach the peak infection. Our results emphasize the importance of using a robust communication infrastructure that can withstand both random and targeted disruptions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: An increasing number of public datasets have shown a marked clinical impact on assessing anatomical structures. However, each of the datasets is small, partially labeled, and rarely investigates severe tumor subjects. Moreover, current models are limited to segmenting specific organs/tumors, which can not be extended to novel domains and classes. To tackle these limitations, we introduce embedding learned from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to segmentation models, dubbed the CLIP-Driven Universal Model. The Universal Model can better segment 25 organs and 6 types of tumors by exploiting the semantic relationship between abdominal structures. The model is developed from an assembly of 14 datasets with 3,410 CT scans and evaluated on 6,162 external CT scans from 3 datasets. We rank first on the public leaderboard of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and achieve the state-of-the-art results on Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV). Compared with dataset-specific models, the Universal Model is computationally more efficient (6x faster), generalizes better to CT scans from varying sites, and shows stronger transfer learning performance on novel tasks. The design of CLIP embedding enables the Universal Model to be easily extended to new classes without catastrophically forgetting the previously learned classes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
