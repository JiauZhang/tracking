        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning (DL) has transformed applications in a variety of domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data analysis. The search for improved DL model accuracy has led practitioners to explore increasingly large neural architectures, with some recent Transformer models spanning hundreds of billions of learnable parameters. These designs have introduced new scale-driven systems challenges for the DL space, such as memory bottlenecks, poor runtime efficiency, and high costs of model development. Efforts to address these issues have explored techniques such as parallelization of neural architectures, spilling data across the memory hierarchy, and memory-efficient data representations. This survey will explore the large-model training systems landscape, highlighting key challenges and the various techniques that have been used to address them. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Modern 3D-GANs synthesize geometry and texture by training on large-scale datasets with a consistent structure. Training such models on stylized, artistic data, with often unknown, highly variable geometry, and camera information has not yet been shown possible. Can we train a 3D GAN on such artistic data, while maintaining multi-view consistency and texture quality? To this end, we propose an adaptation framework, where the source domain is a pre-trained 3D-GAN, while the target domain is a 2D-GAN trained on artistic datasets. We then distill the knowledge from a 2D generator to the source 3D generator. To do that, we first propose an optimization-based method to align the distributions of camera parameters across domains. Second, we propose regularizations necessary to learn high-quality texture, while avoiding degenerate geometric solutions, such as flat shapes. Third, we show a deformation-based technique for modeling exaggerated geometry of artistic domains, enabling -- as a byproduct -- personalized geometric editing. Finally, we propose a novel inversion method for 3D-GANs linking the latent spaces of the source and the target domains. Our contributions -- for the first time -- allow for the generation, editing, and animation of personalized artistic 3D avatars on artistic datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Accurate traffic volume and speed prediction have a wide range of applications in transportation. It can result in useful and timely information for both travellers and transportation decision-makers. In this study, an Attention based Long Sort-Term Memory model (A-LSTM) is proposed to simultaneously predict traffic volume and speed in a critical rural road segmentation which connects Tehran to Chalus, the most tourist destination city in Iran. Moreover, this study compares the results of the A-LSTM model with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Both models show acceptable performance in predicting speed and flow. However, the A-LSTM model outperforms the LSTM in 5 and 15-minute intervals. In contrast, there is no meaningful difference between the two models for the 30-minute time interval. By comparing the performance of the models based on different time horizons, the 15-minute horizon model outperforms the others by reaching the lowest Mean Square Error (MSE) loss of 0.0032, followed by the 30 and 5-minutes horizons with 0.004 and 0.0051, respectively. In addition, this study compares the results of the models based on two transformations of temporal categorical input variables, one-hot or cyclic, for the 15-minute time interval. The results demonstrate that both LSTM and A-LSTM with cyclic feature encoding outperform those with one-hot feature encoding. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Social media networks commonly employ content moderation as a tool to limit the spread of harmful content. However, the efficacy of this strategy in limiting the delivery of harmful content to users is not well understood. In this paper, we create a framework to quantify the efficacy of content moderation and use our metrics to analyze content removal on Facebook within the U.S. news ecosystem. In a data set of over 2M posts with 1.6B user engagements collected from 2,551 U.S. news sources before and during the Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021, we identify 10,811 removed posts. We find that the active engagement life cycle of Facebook posts is very short, with 90% of all engagement occurring within the first 30 hours after posting. Thus, even relatively quick intervention allowed significant accrual of engagement before removal, and prevented only 21% of the predicted engagement potential during a baseline period before the U.S. Capitol attack. Nearly a week after the attack, Facebook began removing older content, but these removals occurred so late in these posts' engagement life cycles that they disrupted less than 1% of predicted future engagement, highlighting the limited impact of this intervention. Content moderation likely has limits in its ability to prevent engagement, especially in a crisis, and we recommend that other approaches such as slowing down the rate of content diffusion be investigated. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Finding antenna designs that satisfy frequency requirements and are also optimal with respect to multiple physical criteria is a critical component in designing next generation hardware. However, such a process is non-trivial because the objective function is typically highly nonlinear and sensitive to subtle design change. Moreover, the objective to be optimized often involves electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which is slow and expensive with commercial simulation software. In this work, we propose a sample-efficient and accurate surrogate model, named CZP (Constant Zeros Poles), to directly estimate the scattering coefficients in the frequency domain of a given 2D planar antenna design, without using a simulator. CZP achieves this by predicting the complex zeros and poles for the frequency response of scattering coefficients, which we have theoretically justified for any linear PDE, including Maxwell's equations. Moreover, instead of using low-dimensional representations, CZP leverages a novel image-based representation for antenna topology inspired by the existing mesh-based EM simulation techniques, and attention-based neural network architectures. We demonstrate experimentally that CZP not only outperforms baselines in terms of test loss, but also is able to find 2D antenna designs verifiable by commercial software with only 40k training samples, when coupling with advanced sequential search techniques like reinforcement learning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This work proposes a story generation pipeline to co-create visual stories with the users. The pipeline allows the user to control events and emotions on the generated content. The pipeline includes two parts: narrative and image generation. For narrative generation, the system generates the next sentence using user-specified keywords and emotion labels. For image generation, diffusion models are used to create a visually appealing image corresponding to each generated sentence. Further, object recognition is applied to the generated images to allow objects in these images to be mentioned in future story development. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many methods for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD) are proposed. However, most methods ignore the huge parameters and computational cost brought by CNNs, and only a few pay attention to the portability and mobility. To facilitate practical applications, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight network for ORSI-SOD based on semantic matching and edge alignment, termed SeaNet. Specifically, SeaNet includes a lightweight MobileNet-V2 for feature extraction, a dynamic semantic matching module (DSMM) for high-level features, an edge self-alignment module (ESAM) for low-level features, and a portable decoder for inference. First, the high-level features are compressed into semantic kernels. Then, semantic kernels are used to activate salient object locations in two groups of high-level features through dynamic convolution operations in DSMM. Meanwhile, in ESAM, cross-scale edge information extracted from two groups of low-level features is self-aligned through L2 loss and used for detail enhancement. Finally, starting from the highest-level features, the decoder infers salient objects based on the accurate locations and fine details contained in the outputs of the two modules. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our lightweight SeaNet not only outperforms most state-of-the-art lightweight methods but also yields comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art conventional methods, while having only 2.76M parameters and running with 1.7G FLOPs for 288x288 inputs.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose CGI-Stereo, a novel neural network architecture that can concurrently achieve real-time performance, state-of-the-art accuracy, and strong generalization ability. The core of our CGI-Stereo is a Context and Geometry Fusion (CGF) block which adaptively fuses context and geometry information for more accurate and efficient cost aggregation and meanwhile provides feedback to feature learning to guide more effective contextual feature extraction. The proposed CGF can be easily embedded into many existing stereo matching networks, such as PSMNet, GwcNet and ACVNet. The resulting networks are improved in accuracy by a large margin. Specially, the model which integrates our CGF with ACVNet could rank 1st on the KITTI 2012 leaderboard among all the published methods. We further propose an informative and concise cost volume, named Attention Feature Volume (AFV), which exploits a correlation volume as attention weights to filter a feature volume. Based on CGF and AFV, the proposed CGI-Stereo outperforms all other published real-time methods on KITTI benchmarks and shows better generalization ability than other real-time methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Uncovering rationales behind predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs) has received increasing attention over recent years. Instance-level GNN explanation aims to discover critical input elements, like nodes or edges, that the target GNN relies upon for making predictions. %These identified sub-structures can provide interpretations of GNN's behavior. Though various algorithms are proposed, most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph which can preserve original predictions. However, an inductive bias is deep-rooted in this framework: several subgraphs can result in the same or similar outputs as the original graphs. Consequently, they have the danger of providing spurious explanations and failing to provide consistent explanations. Applying them to explain weakly-performed GNNs would further amplify these issues. To address this problem, we theoretically examine the predictions of GNNs from the causality perspective. Two typical reasons for spurious explanations are identified: confounding effect of latent variables like distribution shift, and causal factors distinct from the original input. Observing that both confounding effects and diverse causal rationales are encoded in internal representations, \tianxiang{we propose a new explanation framework with an auxiliary alignment loss, which is theoretically proven to be optimizing a more faithful explanation objective intrinsically. Concretely for this alignment loss, a set of different perspectives are explored: anchor-based alignment, distributional alignment based on Gaussian mixture models, mutual-information-based alignment, etc. A comprehensive study is conducted both on the effectiveness of this new framework in terms of explanation faithfulness/consistency and on the advantages of these variants. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Answer selection (AS) is a critical subtask of the open-domain question answering (QA) problem. The present paper proposes a method called RLAS-BIABC for AS, which is established on attention mechanism-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) word embedding, enriched by an improved artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for pretraining and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for training backpropagation (BP) algorithm. BERT can be comprised in downstream work and fine-tuned as a united task-specific architecture, and the pretrained BERT model can grab different linguistic effects. Existing algorithms typically train the AS model with positive-negative pairs for a two-class classifier. A positive pair contains a question and a genuine answer, while a negative one includes a question and a fake answer. The output should be one for positive and zero for negative pairs. Typically, negative pairs are more than positive, leading to an imbalanced classification that drastically reduces system performance. To deal with it, we define classification as a sequential decision-making process in which the agent takes a sample at each step and classifies it. For each classification operation, the agent receives a reward, in which the prize of the majority class is less than the reward of the minority class. Ultimately, the agent finds the optimal value for the policy weights. We initialize the policy weights with the improved ABC algorithm. The initial value technique can prevent problems such as getting stuck in the local optimum. Although ABC serves well in most tasks, there is still a weakness in the ABC algorithm that disregards the fitness of related pairs of individuals in discovering a neighboring food source position. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Though neural networks have achieved enormous breakthroughs on various fields (e.g., computer vision) in supervised learning, they still trailed the performances of GBDTs on tabular data thus far. Delving into this issue, we identify that a proper handling of feature interactions and feature embedding is crucial to the success of neural networks on tabular data. We develop a novel neural network called ExcelFormer, which alternates in turn two attention modules that respectively manipulate careful feature interactions and feature embedding updates. A bespoke training methodology is jointly introduced to facilitate the model performances. By initializing parameters with minuscule values, these attention modules are attenuated when the training begins, and the effects of feature interactions and embedding updates progressively grow up to optimum levels under the guidance of the proposed specific regularization approaches Swap-Mix and Hidden-Mix as the training proceeds. Experiments on 25 public tabular datasets show that our ExcelFormer is superior to extremely-tuned GBDTs, which is an unprecedented achievement of neural networks in supervised tabular learning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Maps are a very important component of strategy games, and a time-consuming task if done by hand. Maps generated by traditional PCG techniques such as Perlin noise or tile-based PCG techniques look unnatural and unappealing, thus not providing the best user experience for the players. However it is possible to have a generator that can create realistic and natural images of maps, given that it is trained how to do so. We propose a model for the generation of maps based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In our implementation we tested out different variants of GAN-based networks on a dataset of heightmaps. We conducted extensive empirical evaluation to determine the advantages and properties of each approach. The results obtained are promising, showing that it is indeed possible to generate realistic looking maps using this type of approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to music generation systems with promising results. However, one of the main challenges in this field has been the lack of annotated datasets, making it difficult for models to learn musical forms in compositions. To address this issue, we present TunesFormer, a Transformer-based melody generation system that is trained on a large dataset of 285,449 ABC tunes. By utilizing specific symbols commonly found in ABC notation to indicate section boundaries, TunesFormer can understand and generate melodies with given musical forms based on control codes. Our objective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the control codes in achieving controlled musical forms, and subjective experiments show that the generated melodies are of comparable quality to human compositions. Our results also provide insights into the optimal placement of control codes and their impact on the generated melodies. TunesFormer presents a promising approach for generating melodies with desired musical forms through the use of deep learning techniques. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite surprising performance on zero-shot transfer, pre-training a large-scale multimodal model is often prohibitive as it requires a huge amount of data and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a method (BeamCLIP) that can effectively transfer the representations of a large pre-trained multimodal model (CLIP-ViT) into a small target model (e.g., ResNet-18). For unsupervised transfer, we introduce cross-modal similarity matching (CSM) that enables a student model to learn the representations of a teacher model by matching the relative similarity distribution across text prompt embeddings. To better encode the text prompts, we design context-based prompt augmentation (CPA) that can alleviate the lexical ambiguity of input text prompts. Our experiments show that unsupervised representation transfer of a pre-trained vision-language model enables a small ResNet-18 to achieve a better ImageNet-1K top-1 linear probe accuracy (66.2%) than vision-only self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (e.g., SimCLR: 51.8%, SwAV: 63.7%), while closing the gap with supervised learning (69.8%). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved a lot of success with graph-structured data. However, it is observed that the performance of GNNs does not improve (or even worsen) as the number of layers increases. This effect has known as over-smoothing, which means that the representations of the graph nodes of different classes would become indistinguishable when stacking multiple layers. In this work, we propose a new simple, and efficient method to alleviate the effect of the over-smoothing problem in GNNs by explicitly using relations between node embeddings. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that utilizing node embedding relations makes GNN models such as Graph Attention Network more robust to over-smoothing and achieves better performance with deeper GNNs. Our method can be used in combination with other methods to give the best performance. GNN applications are endless and depend on the user's objective and the type of data that they possess. Solving over-smoothing issues can potentially improve the performance of models on all these tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A micro-expression is a spontaneous unconscious facial muscle movement that can reveal the true emotions people attempt to hide. Although manual methods have made good progress and deep learning is gaining prominence. Due to the short duration of micro-expression occurrence and different scales of expressing in facial regions, existing algorithms cannot extract multi-modal multi-scale facial region features while taking into account contextual information to learn underlying features. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, a multi-modal multi-scale algorithm based on transformer network is proposed in this paper, aiming to fully learn local multi-grained features of micro-expressions through two modal features of micro-expressions - motion features and texture features. To obtain local area features of the face at different scales, we learned patch features at different scales for both modalities, and then fused multi-layer multi-headed attention weights to obtain effective features by weighting the patch features, and combined cross-modal contrastive learning for model optimization. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three spontaneous datasets, and the results show the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in single measurement SMIC database is up to 78.73% and the F1 value on CASMEII of the combined database is up to 0.9071, which is at the leading level. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Local feature matching between images remains a challenging task, especially in the presence of significant appearance variations, e.g., extreme viewpoint changes. In this work, we propose DeepMatcher, a deep Transformer-based network built upon our investigation of local feature matching in detector-free methods. The key insight is that local feature matcher with deep layers can capture more human-intuitive and simpler-to-match features. Based on this, we propose a Slimming Transformer (SlimFormer) dedicated for DeepMatcher, which leverages vector-based attention to model relevance among all keypoints and achieves long-range context aggregation in an efficient and effective manner. A relative position encoding is applied to each SlimFormer so as to explicitly disclose relative distance information, further improving the representation of keypoints. A layer-scale strategy is also employed in each SlimFormer to enable the network to assimilate message exchange from the residual block adaptively, thus allowing it to simulate the human behaviour that humans can acquire different matching cues each time they scan an image pair. To facilitate a better adaption of the SlimFormer, we introduce a Feature Transition Module (FTM) to ensure a smooth transition in feature scopes with different receptive fields. By interleaving the self- and cross-SlimFormer multiple times, DeepMatcher can easily establish pixel-wise dense matches at coarse level. Finally, we perceive the match refinement as a combination of classification and regression problems and design Fine Matches Module to predict confidence and offset concurrently, thereby generating robust and accurate matches. Experimentally, we show that DeepMatcher significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the superior matching capability of DeepMatcher. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Sequential multi-step cloth manipulation is a challenging problem in robotic manipulation, requiring a robot to perceive the cloth state and plan a sequence of chained actions leading to the desired state. Most previous works address this problem in a goal-conditioned way, and goal observation must be given for each specific task and cloth configuration, which is not practical and efficient. Thus, we present a novel multi-step cloth manipulation planning framework named Foldformer. Foldformer can complete similar tasks with only a general demonstration and utilize a space-time attention mechanism to capture the instruction information behind this demonstration. We experimentally evaluate Foldsformer on four representative sequential multi-step manipulation tasks and show that Foldsformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in simulation. Foldformer can complete multi-step cloth manipulation tasks even when configurations of the cloth (e.g., size and pose) vary from configurations in the general demonstrations. Furthermore, our approach can be transferred from simulation to the real world without additional training or domain randomization. Despite training on rectangular clothes, we also show that our approach can generalize to unseen cloth shapes (T-shirts and shorts).

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Time series forecasting has been a widely explored task of great importance in many applications. However, it is common that real-world time series data are recorded in a short time period, which results in a big gap between the deep model and the limited and noisy time series. In this work, we propose to address the time series forecasting problem with generative modeling and propose a bidirectional variational auto-encoder (BVAE) equipped with diffusion, denoise, and disentanglement, namely D3VAE. Specifically, a coupled diffusion probabilistic model is proposed to augment the time series data without increasing the aleatoric uncertainty and implement a more tractable inference process with BVAE. To ensure the generated series move toward the true target, we further propose to adapt and integrate the multiscale denoising score matching into the diffusion process for time series forecasting. In addition, to enhance the interpretability and stability of the prediction, we treat the latent variable in a multivariate manner and disentangle them on top of minimizing total correlation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that D3VAE outperforms competitive algorithms with remarkable margins. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpatial/tree/main/research/D3VAE. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Crowd counting aims to estimate the number of persons in a scene. Most state-of-the-art crowd counting methods based on color images can't work well in poor illumination conditions due to invisible objects. With the widespread use of infrared cameras, crowd counting based on color and thermal images is studied. Existing methods only achieve multi-modal fusion without count objective constraint. To better excavate multi-modal information, we use count-guided multi-modal fusion and modal-guided count enhancement to achieve the impressive performance. The proposed count-guided multi-modal fusion module utilizes a multi-scale token transformer to interact two-modal information under the guidance of count information and perceive different scales from the token perspective. The proposed modal-guided count enhancement module employs multi-scale deformable transformer decoder structure to enhance one modality feature and count information by the other modality. Experiment in public RGBT-CC dataset shows that our method refreshes the state-of-the-art results. https://github.com/liuzywen/RGBTCC <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The High-Resolution Transformer (HRFormer) can maintain high-resolution representation and share global receptive fields. It is friendly towards salient object detection (SOD) in which the input and output have the same resolution. However, two critical problems need to be solved for two-modality SOD. One problem is two-modality fusion. The other problem is the HRFormer output's fusion. To address the first problem, a supplementary modality is injected into the primary modality by using global optimization and an attention mechanism to select and purify the modality at the input level. To solve the second problem, a dual-direction short connection fusion module is used to optimize the output features of HRFormer, thereby enhancing the detailed representation of objects at the output level. The proposed model, named HRTransNet, first introduces an auxiliary stream for feature extraction of supplementary modality. Then, features are injected into the primary modality at the beginning of each multi-resolution branch. Next, HRFormer is applied to achieve forwarding propagation. Finally, all the output features with different resolutions are aggregated by intra-feature and inter-feature interactive transformers. Application of the proposed model results in impressive improvement for driving two-modality SOD tasks, e.g., RGB-D, RGB-T, and light field SOD.https://github.com/liuzywen/HRTransNet <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Hence, in this paper, we seek to systematically review motivations and progress on using Transformers in RL, provide a taxonomy on existing works, discuss each sub-field, and summarize future prospects. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many real-world data can be modeled as heterogeneous graphs that contain multiple types of nodes and edges. Meanwhile, due to excellent performance, heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have received more and more attention. However, the existing work mainly focuses on the design of novel GNN models, while ignoring another important issue that also has a large impact on the model performance, namely the missing attributes of some node types. The handcrafted attribute completion requires huge expert experience and domain knowledge. Also, considering the differences in semantic characteristics between nodes, the attribute completion should be fine-grained, i.e., the attribute completion operation should be node-specific. Moreover, to improve the performance of the downstream graph learning task, attribute completion and the training of the heterogeneous GNN should be jointly optimized rather than viewed as two separate processes. To address the above challenges, we propose a differentiable attribute completion framework called AutoAC for automated completion operation search in heterogeneous GNNs. We first propose an expressive completion operation search space, including topology-dependent and topology-independent completion operations. Then, we propose a continuous relaxation schema and further propose a differentiable completion algorithm where the completion operation search is formulated as a bi-level joint optimization problem. To improve the search efficiency, we leverage two optimization techniques: discrete constraints and auxiliary unsupervised graph node clustering. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets reveal that AutoAC outperforms the SOTA handcrafted heterogeneous GNNs and the existing attribute completion method <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image inpainting consists of filling holes or missing parts of an image. Inpainting face images with symmetric characteristics is more challenging than inpainting a natural scene. None of the powerful existing models can fill out the missing parts of an image while considering the symmetry and homogeneity of the picture. Moreover, the metrics that assess a repaired face image quality cannot measure the preservation of symmetry between the rebuilt and existing parts of a face. In this paper, we intend to solve the symmetry problem in the face inpainting task by using multiple discriminators that check each face organ's reality separately and a transformer-based network. We also propose "symmetry concentration score" as a new metric for measuring the symmetry of a repaired face image. The quantitative and qualitative results show the superiority of our proposed method compared to some of the recently proposed algorithms in terms of the reality, symmetry, and homogeneity of the inpainted parts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG) is an emerging cross-modal grounding task, which locates the target regions of an image corresponding to the text description. Existing approaches for PNG are mainly based on a two-stage paradigm, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a one-stage network for real-time PNG, termed End-to-End Panoptic Narrative Grounding network (EPNG), which directly generates masks for referents. Specifically, we propose two innovative designs, i.e., Locality-Perceptive Attention (LPA) and a bidirectional Semantic Alignment Loss (SAL), to properly handle the many-to-many relationship between textual expressions and visual objects. LPA embeds the local spatial priors into attention modeling, i.e., a pixel may belong to multiple masks at different scales, thereby improving segmentation. To help understand the complex semantic relationships, SAL proposes a bidirectional contrastive objective to regularize the semantic consistency inter modalities. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Compared to the single-stage baseline, our method achieves a significant improvement of up to 9.4% accuracy. More importantly, our EPNG is 10 times faster than the two-stage model. Meanwhile, the generalization ability of EPNG is also validated by zero-shot experiments on other grounding tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

However, most previous works are evaluated on a few benchmark datasets, such as KITTI datasets, and none of the works provide an in-depth analysis of the generalization performance of monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we deeply investigate the various backbone networks (e.g.CNN and Transformer models) toward the generalization of monocular depth estimation. First, we evaluate state-of-the-art models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, which have never been seen during network training. Then, we investigate the internal properties of the representations from the intermediate layers of CNN-/Transformer-based models using synthetic texture-shifted datasets. Through extensive experiments, we observe that the Transformers exhibit a strong shape-bias rather than CNNs, which have a strong texture-bias. We also discover that texture-biased models exhibit worse generalization performance for monocular depth estimation than shape-biased models. We demonstrate that similar aspects are observed in real-world driving datasets captured under diverse environments. Lastly, we conduct a dense ablation study with various backbone networks which are utilized in modern strategies. The experiments demonstrate that the intrinsic locality of the CNNs and the self-attention of the Transformers induce texture-bias and shape-bias, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) finite-volume discretization for a nonlinear cross-diffusion system arising in population dynamics is studied. The numerical scheme preserves the Rao entropy structure and conserves the mass. The existence and uniqueness of discrete solutions and their large-time behavior as well as the convergence of the scheme are proved. The proofs are based on the G-stability of the BDF2 scheme, which provides an inequality for the quadratic Rao entropy and hence suitable a priori estimates. The novelty is the extension of this inequality to the system case. Some numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions underline the theoretical results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Wireless backhauling at millimeter-wave frequencies (mmWave) in static scenarios is a well-established practice in cellular networks. However, highly directional and adaptive beamforming in today's mmWave systems have opened new possibilities for self-backhauling. Tapping into this potential, 3GPP has standardized Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) allowing the same base station serve both access and backhaul traffic. Although much more cost-effective and flexible, resource allocation and path selection in IAB mmWave networks is a formidable task. To date, prior works have addressed this challenge through a plethora of classic optimization and learning methods, generally optimizing a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) such as throughput, latency, and fairness, and little attention has been paid to the reliability of the KPI. We propose Safehaul, a risk-averse learning-based solution for IAB mmWave networks. In addition to optimizing average performance, Safehaul ensures reliability by minimizing the losses in the tail of the performance distribution. We develop a novel simulator and show via extensive simulations that Safehaul not only reduces the latency by up to 43.2% compared to the benchmarks but also exhibits significantly more reliable performance (e.g., 71.4% less variance in achieved latency). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) refers to the use of AI to automate the information creation process while fulfilling the personalized requirements of users. However, due to the instability of AIGC models, e.g., the stochastic nature of diffusion models, the quality and accuracy of the generated content can vary significantly. In wireless edge networks, the transmission of incorrectly generated content may unnecessarily consume network resources. Thus, a dynamic AIGC service provider (ASP) selection scheme is required to enable users to connect to the most suited ASP, improving the users' satisfaction and quality of generated content. In this article, we first review the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then present the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in deploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several image-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general and effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational resources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient AaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a higher quality of generated content to users and achieve fewer crashed tasks by comparing with four benchmarks, i.e., overloading-avoidance, random, round-robin policies, and the upper-bound schemes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Online shopping stores have grown steadily over the past few years. Due to the massive growth of these businesses, the detection of fake reviews has attracted attention. Fake reviews are seriously trying to mislead customers and thereby undermine the honesty and authenticity of online shopping environments. So far, various fake review classifiers have been proposed that take into account the actual content of the review. To improve the accuracies of existing fake review classification or detection approaches, we propose to use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) model to extract word embeddings from texts (i.e. reviews). Word embeddings are obtained in various basic methods such as SVM (Support vector machine), Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and others. The confusion matrix method was also taken into account to evaluate and graphically represent the results. The results indicate that the SVM classifiers outperform the others in terms of accuracy and f1-score with an accuracy of 87.81%, which is 7.6% higher than the classifier used in the previous study [5]. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multimodal learning can benefit from the representation power of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). However, state-of-the-art transformer based LLMs often ignore negations in natural language and there is no existing benchmark to quantitatively evaluate whether multimodal transformers inherit this weakness. In this study, we present a new multimodal question answering (QA) benchmark adapted from labeled music videos in AudioSet (Gemmeke et al., 2017) with the goal of systematically evaluating if multimodal transformers can perform complex reasoning to recognize new concepts as negation of previously learned concepts. We show that with standard fine-tuning approach multimodal transformers are still incapable of correctly interpreting negation irrespective of model size. However, our experiments demonstrate that augmenting the original training task distributions with negated QA examples allow the model to reliably reason with negation. To do this, we describe a novel data generation procedure that prompts the 540B-parameter PaLM model to automatically generate negated QA examples as compositions of easily accessible video tags. The generated examples contain more natural linguistic patterns and the gains compared to template-based task augmentation approach are significant. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Over the past decade, the media landscape has seen a radical shift. As more of the public stay informed of current events via online sources, competition has grown as outlets vie for attention. This competition has prompted some online outlets to publish sensationalist and alarmist content to grab readers' attention. Such practices may threaten democracy by distorting the truth and misleading readers about the nature of events. This paper proposes a novel system for detecting, processing, and warning users about misleading content online to combat the threats posed by misinformation. By training a machine learning model on an existing dataset of 32,000 clickbait news article headlines, the model predicts how sensationalist a headline is and then interfaces with a web browser extension which constructs a unique content warning notification based on existing design principles and incorporates the models' prediction. This research makes a novel contribution to machine learning and human-centred security with promising findings for future research. By warning users when they may be viewing misinformation, it is possible to prevent spontaneous reactions, helping users to take a deep breath and approach online media with a clear mind. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite the success of Neural Combinatorial Optimization methods for end-to-end heuristic learning, out-of-distribution generalization remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of combinatorial optimization (CO) problems as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that effectively leverages symmetries of the CO problems to improve out-of-distribution robustness. Starting from the standard MDP formulation of constructive heuristics, we introduce a generic transformation based on bisimulation quotienting (BQ) in MDPs. This transformation allows to reduce the state space by accounting for the intrinsic symmetries of the CO problem and facilitates the MDP solving. We illustrate our approach on the Traveling Salesman, Capacitated Vehicle Routing and Knapsack Problems. We present a BQ reformulation of these problems and introduce a simple attention-based policy network that we train by imitation of (near) optimal solutions for small instances from a single distribution. We obtain new state-of-the-art generalization results for instances with up to 1000 nodes from synthetic and realistic benchmarks that vary both in size and node distributions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel a-posteriori error estimation technique where the target quantities of interest are ratios of high-dimensional integrals, as occur e.g. in PDE constrained Bayesian inversion and PDE constrained optimal control subject to an entropic risk measure. We consider in particular parametric, elliptic PDEs with affine-parametric diffusion coefficient, on high-dimensional parameter spaces. We combine our recent a-posteriori Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) error analysis, with Finite Element a-posteriori error estimation. The proposed approach yields a computable a-posteriori estimator which is reliable, up to higher order terms. The estimator's reliability is uniform with respect to the PDE discretization, and robust with respect to the parametric dimension of the uncertain PDE input. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Representation learning is the foundation of natural language processing (NLP). This work presents new methods to employ visual information as assistant signals to general NLP tasks. For each sentence, we first retrieve a flexible number of images either from a light topic-image lookup table extracted over the existing sentence-image pairs or a shared cross-modal embedding space that is pre-trained on out-of-shelf text-image pairs. Then, the text and images are encoded by a Transformer encoder and convolutional neural network, respectively. The two sequences of representations are further fused by an attention layer for the interaction of the two modalities. In this study, the retrieval process is controllable and flexible. The universal visual representation overcomes the lack of large-scale bilingual sentence-image pairs. Our method can be easily applied to text-only tasks without manually annotated multimodal parallel corpora. We apply the proposed method to a wide range of natural language generation and understanding tasks, including neural machine translation, natural language inference, and semantic similarity. Experimental results show that our method is generally effective for different tasks and languages. Analysis indicates that the visual signals enrich textual representations of content words, provide fine-grained grounding information about the relationship between concepts and events, and potentially conduce to disambiguation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human infant learning happens during exploration of the environment, by interaction with objects, and by listening to and repeating utterances casually, which is analogous to unsupervised learning. Only occasionally, a learning infant would receive a matching verbal description of an action it is committing, which is similar to supervised learning. Such a learning mechanism can be mimicked with deep learning. We model this weakly supervised learning paradigm using our Paired Gated Autoencoders (PGAE) model, which combines an action and a language autoencoder. After observing a performance drop when reducing the proportion of supervised training, we introduce the Paired Transformed Autoencoders (PTAE) model, using Transformer-based crossmodal attention. PTAE achieves significantly higher accuracy in language-to-action and action-to-language translations, particularly in realistic but difficult cases when only few supervised training samples are available. We also test whether the trained model behaves realistically with conflicting multimodal input. In accordance with the concept of incongruence in psychology, conflict deteriorates the model output. Conflicting action input has a more severe impact than conflicting language input, and more conflicting features lead to larger interference. PTAE can be trained on mostly unlabelled data where labeled data is scarce, and it behaves plausibly when tested with incongruent input. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Our increasingly connected world continues to face an ever-growing amount of network-based attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are an essential security technology for detecting these attacks. Although numerous machine learning-based IDS have been proposed for the detection of malicious network traffic, the majority have difficulty properly detecting and classifying the more uncommon attack types. In this paper, we implement a novel hybrid technique using synthetic data produced by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to use as input for training a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model. Our GAN model is trained with the NSL-KDD dataset for four attack categories as well as normal network flow. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that training the DRL on specific synthetic datasets can result in better performance in correctly classifying minority classes over training on the true imbalanced dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Task-agnostic knowledge distillation attempts to address the problem of deploying large pretrained language model in resource-constrained scenarios by compressing a large pretrained model called teacher into a smaller one called student such that the student can be directly finetuned on downstream tasks and retains comparable performance. However, we empirically find that there is a generalization gap between the student and the teacher in existing methods. In this work, we show that we can leverage multi-task learning in task-agnostic distillation to advance the generalization of the resulted student. In particular, we propose Multi-task Infused Task-agnostic Knowledge Distillation (MITKD). We first enhance the teacher by multi-task training it on multiple downstream tasks and then perform distillation to produce the student. Experimental results demonstrate that our method yields a student with much better generalization, significantly outperforms existing baselines, and establishes a new state-of-the-art result on in-domain, out-domain, and low-resource datasets in the setting of task-agnostic distillation. Moreover, our method even exceeds an 8x larger BERT$_{\text{Base}}$ on SQuAD and four GLUE tasks. In addition, by combining ERNIE 3.0, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 Chinese datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have their own advantages and both have been widely used for dense prediction in multi-task learning (MTL). Most of the current studies on MTL solely rely on CNN or Transformer. In this work, we present a novel MTL model by combining both merits of deformable CNN and query-based Transformer for multi-task learning of dense prediction. Our method, named DeMT, is based on a simple and effective encoder-decoder architecture (i.e., deformable mixer encoder and task-aware transformer decoder). First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators: the channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among different channels ($i.e.,$ efficient channel location mixing), and the spatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution applied to efficiently sample more informative spatial locations (i.e., deformed features). Second, the task-aware transformer decoder consists of the task interaction block and task query block. The former is applied to capture task interaction features via self-attention. The latter leverages the deformed features and task-interacted features to generate the corresponding task-specific feature through a query-based Transformer for corresponding task predictions. Extensive experiments on two dense image prediction datasets, NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that our model uses fewer GFLOPs and significantly outperforms current Transformer- and CNN-based competitive models on a variety of metrics.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., "open door" and "open fridge", "walk upstairs" and "walk downstairs". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens ("open", "walk"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution ("open fridge", "walk upstairs") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The remarkable performance of the Transformer architecture in natural language processing has recently also triggered broad interest in Computer Vision. Among other merits, Transformers are witnessed as capable of learning long-range dependencies and spatial correlations, which is a clear advantage over convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been the de facto standard in Computer Vision problems so far. Thus, Transformers have become an integral part of modern medical image analysis. In this review, we provide an encyclopedic review of the applications of Transformers in medical imaging. Specifically, we present a systematic and thorough review of relevant recent Transformer literature for different medical image analysis tasks, including classification, segmentation, detection, registration, synthesis, and clinical report generation. For each of these applications, we investigate the novelty, strengths and weaknesses of the different proposed strategies and develop taxonomies highlighting key properties and contributions. Further, if applicable, we outline current benchmarks on different datasets. Finally, we summarize key challenges and discuss different future research directions. In addition, we have provided cited papers with their corresponding implementations in https://github.com/mindflow-institue/Awesome-Transformer. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to learn how human interacts with surrounding objects. Previous HOI detection frameworks simultaneously detect human, objects and their corresponding interactions by using a predictor. Using only one shared predictor cannot differentiate the attentive field of instance-level prediction and relation-level prediction. To solve this problem, we propose a new transformer-based method named Parallel Reasoning Network(PR-Net), which constructs two independent predictors for instance-level localization and relation-level understanding. The former predictor concentrates on instance-level localization by perceiving instances' extremity regions. The latter broadens the scope of relation region to reach a better relation-level semantic understanding. Extensive experiments and analysis on HICO-DET benchmark exhibit that our PR-Net effectively alleviated this problem. Our PR-Net has achieved competitive results on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Mutation testing is an established fault-based testing technique. It operates by seeding faults into the programs under test and asking developers to write tests that reveal these faults. These tests have the potential to reveal a large number of faults -- those that couple with the seeded ones -- and thus are deemed important. To this end, mutation testing should seed faults that are both "natural" in a sense easily understood by developers and strong (have high chances to reveal faults). To achieve this we propose using pre-trained generative language models (i.e. CodeBERT) that have the ability to produce developer-like code that operates similarly, but not exactly, as the target code. This means that the models have the ability to seed natural faults, thereby offering opportunities to perform mutation testing. We realise this idea by implementing $\mu$BERT, a mutation testing technique that performs mutation testing using CodeBert and empirically evaluated it using 689 faulty program versions. Our results show that the fault revelation ability of $\mu$BERT is higher than that of a state-of-the-art mutation testing (PiTest), yielding tests that have up to 17% higher fault detection potential than that of PiTest. Moreover, we observe that $\mu$BERT can complement PiTest, being able to detect 47 bugs missed by PiTest, while at the same time, PiTest can find 13 bugs missed by $\mu$BERT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We identify and overcome two key obstacles in extending the success of BERT-style pre-training, or the masked image modeling, to convolutional networks (convnets): (i) convolution operation cannot handle irregular, random-masked input images; (ii) the single-scale nature of BERT pre-training is inconsistent with convnet's hierarchical structure. For (i), we treat unmasked pixels as sparse voxels of 3D point clouds and use sparse convolution to encode. This is the first use of sparse convolution for 2D masked modeling. For (ii), we develop a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features. Our method called Sparse masKed modeling (SparK) is general: it can be used directly on any convolutional model without backbone modifications. We validate it on both classical (ResNet) and modern (ConvNeXt) models: on three downstream tasks, it surpasses both state-of-the-art contrastive learning and transformer-based masked modeling by similarly large margins (around +1.0%). Improvements on object detection and instance segmentation are more substantial (up to +3.5%), verifying the strong transferability of features learned. We also find its favorable scaling behavior by observing more gains on larger models. All this evidence reveals a promising future of generative pre-training on convnets.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Motion artifact reduction is one of the important research topics in MR imaging, as the motion artifact degrades image quality and makes diagnosis difficult. Recently, many deep learning approaches have been studied for motion artifact reduction. Unfortunately, most existing models are trained in a supervised manner, requiring paired motion-corrupted and motion-free images, or are based on a strict motion-corruption model, which limits their use for real-world situations. To address this issue, here we present an annealed score-based diffusion model for MRI motion artifact reduction. Specifically, we train a score-based model using only motion-free images, and then motion artifacts are removed by applying forward and reverse diffusion processes repeatedly to gradually impose a low-frequency data consistency. Experimental results verify that the proposed method successfully reduces both simulated and in vivo motion artifacts, outperforming the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Computational reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision and computational photography. Most of the conventional optimization and deep learning techniques explore local information for reconstruction. Recently, nonlocal low-rank (NLR) reconstruction has achieved remarkable success in improving accuracy and generalization. However, the computational cost has inhibited NLR from seeking global structural similarity, which consequentially keeps it trapped in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency and prevents it from high-dimensional large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we report here the global low-rank (GLR) optimization technique, realizing highly-efficient large-scale reconstruction with global self-similarity. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism in deep learning, GLR extracts exemplar image patches by feature detection instead of conventional uniform selection. This directly produces key patches using structural features to avoid burdensome computational redundancy. Further, it performs patch matching across the entire image via neural-based convolution, which produces the global similarity heat map in parallel, rather than conventional sequential block-wise matching. As such, GLR improves patch grouping efficiency by more than one order of magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate GLR's effectiveness on temporal, frequency, and spectral dimensions, including different computational imaging modalities of compressive temporal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and multispectral filter array demosaicing. This work presents the superiority of inherent fusion of deep learning strategies and iterative optimization, and breaks the persistent dilemma of the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency for various large-scale reconstruction tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we investigate a continuous time version of the Stochastic Langevin Monte Carlo method, introduced in [WT11], that incorporates a stochastic sampling step inside the traditional over-damped Langevin diffusion. This method is popular in machine learning for sampling posterior distribution. We will pay specific attention in our work to the computational cost in terms of $n$ (the number of observations that produces the posterior distribution), and $d$ (the dimension of the ambient space where the parameter of interest is living). We derive our analysis in the weakly convex framework, which is parameterized with the help of the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) inequality, that permits to handle a vanishing curvature settings, which is far less restrictive when compared to the simple strongly convex case. We establish that the final horizon of simulation to obtain an $\varepsilon$ approximation (in terms of entropy) is of the order $( d \log(n)^2 )^{(1+r)^2} [\log^2(\varepsilon^{-1}) + n^2 d^{2(1+r)} \log^{4(1+r)}(n) ]$ with a Poissonian subsampling of parameter $\left(n ( d \log^2(n))^{1+r}\right)^{-1}$, where the parameter $r$ is involved in the KL inequality and varies between $0$ (strongly convex case) and $1$ (limiting Laplace situation). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The stochastic proximal point (SPP) methods have gained recent attention for stochastic optimization, with strong convergence guarantees and superior robustness to the classic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods showcased at little to no cost of computational overhead added. In this article, we study a minibatch variant of SPP, namely M-SPP, for solving convex composite risk minimization problems. The core contribution is a set of novel excess risk bounds of M-SPP derived through the lens of algorithmic stability theory. Particularly under smoothness and quadratic growth conditions, we show that M-SPP with minibatch-size $n$ and iteration count $T$ enjoys an in-expectation fast rate of convergence consisting of an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}\right)$ bias decaying term and an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{nT}\right)$ variance decaying term. In the small-$n$-large-$T$ setting, this result substantially improves the best known results of SPP-type approaches by revealing the impact of noise level of model on convergence rate. In the complementary small-$T$-large-$n$ regime, we provide a two-phase extension of M-SPP to achieve comparable convergence rates. Moreover, we derive a near-tight high probability (over the randomness of data) bound on the parameter estimation error of a sampling-without-replacement variant of M-SPP. Numerical evidences are provided to support our theoretical predictions when substantialized to Lasso and logistic regression models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a promising technique to enable and enhance future wireless communications due to its potential to engineer the wireless channels in a cost-effective manner. Extensive research attention has been drawn to the use of conventional RIS 1.0 with diagonal phase shift matrices, where each RIS element is connected to its own load to ground but not connected to other elements. However, the simple architecture of RIS 1.0 limits its flexibility of manipulating passive beamforming. To fully exploit the benefits of RIS, in this paper, we introduce RIS 2.0 beyond diagonal phase shift matrices, namely beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS). We first explain the modeling of BD-RIS based on the scattering parameter network analysis and classify BD-RIS by the mathematical characteristics of the scattering matrix, supported modes, and architectures. Then, we provide simulations to evaluate the sum-rate performance with different modes/architectures of BD-RIS. We summarize the benefits of BD-RIS in providing high flexibility in wave manipulation, enlarging coverage, facilitating the deployment, and requiring low complexity in resolution bit and element numbers. Inspired by the benefits of BD-RIS, we also discuss potential applications of BD-RIS in various wireless systems. Finally, we list key challenges in modeling, designing, and implementing BD-RIS in practice and point to possible future research directions for BD-RIS. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The joint hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR data classification aims to interpret ground objects at more detailed and precise level. Although deep learning methods have shown remarkable success in the multisource data classification task, self-supervised learning has rarely been explored. It is commonly nontrivial to build a robust self-supervised learning model for multisource data classification, due to the fact that the semantic similarities of neighborhood regions are not exploited in existing contrastive learning framework. Furthermore, the heterogeneous gap induced by the inconsistent distribution of multisource data impedes the classification performance. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a Nearest Neighbor-based Contrastive Learning Network (NNCNet), which takes full advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data to learn discriminative feature representations. Specifically, we propose a nearest neighbor-based data augmentation scheme to use enhanced semantic relationships among nearby regions. The intermodal semantic alignments can be captured more accurately. In addition, we design a bilinear attention module to exploit the second-order and even high-order feature interactions between the HSI and LiDAR data. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NNCNet over state-of-the-art methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As an essential measure to combat global warming, electric vehicles (EVs) have witnessed rapid growth. Meanwhile, thanks to the flexibility of EV charging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interaction has captured great attention. However, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small capacity, large number, and private information. Hence, it is the aggregator that interacts with the grid on behalf of EVs by characterizing their aggregate flexibility. In this paper, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility characterization problem. First, an offline model is built to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the aggregate power flexibility region. It ensures that any trajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters such as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not known in advance, an online algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization techniques. We prove that the charging time delays for EVs always meet the requirement even if they are not considered explicitly. Furthermore, real-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online algorithm to better unlock EV power flexibility. Comprehensive performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Prediction of the electronic structure of functional materials is essential for the engineering of new devices. Conventional electronic structure prediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not only high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based on machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to bypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band gaps, which motivated this research study. Herein, we construct a random forest regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation) functional. Among the 20 physical features employed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and cation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with the physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features, a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained, comparable to previous studies. Our results are significant in the sense that they attest to the potential of machine learning regressions for the rapid screening of promising candidate functional materials. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Computational discovery of ideal lead compounds is a critical process for modern drug discovery. It comprises multiple stages: hit screening, molecular property prediction, and molecule optimization. Current efforts are disparate, involving the establishment of models for each stage, followed by multi-stage multi-model integration. However, this is non-ideal, as clumsy integration of incompatible models increases research overheads, and may even reduce success rates in drug discovery. Facilitating compatibilities requires establishing inherent model consistencies across lead discovery stages. Towards that effect, we propose an open deep graph learning (DGL) based pipeline: generative adversarial feature subspace enhancement (GAFSE), which first unifies the modeling of these stages into one learning framework. GAFSE also offers standardized modular design and streamlined interfaces for future expansions and community support. GAFSE combines adversarial/generative learning, graph attention network, graph reconstruction network, and optimizes the classification/regression loss, adversarial/generative loss, and reconstruction loss simultaneously. Convergence analysis theoretically guarantees model generalization performance. Exhaustive benchmarking demonstrates that the GAFSE pipeline achieves excellent performance across almost all lead discovery stages, while also providing valuable model interpretability. Hence, we believe this tool will enhance the efficiency and productivity of drug discovery researchers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, typically observed via seizure episodes. Epileptic seizures are commonly monitored through electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings due to their routine and low expense collection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes seizure identification via manual inspections performed by highly-trained experts a tedious endeavor, motivating the use of automated identification. The literature on automated identification focuses mostly on supervised learning methods requiring expert labels of EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain. Motivated by these observations, we pose seizure identification as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem. To this end, we employ the first unsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG. We train an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss function, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for multivariate time-series data such as EEG. Training employs EEG recordings that do not contain any seizures, while seizures are identified with respect to reconstruction errors at inference time. We evaluate our method on three publicly available benchmark EEG datasets for distinguishing seizure vs. non-seizure windows. Our method leads to significantly better seizure identification performance than supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16% recall, 9% accuracy, and 9% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), establishing particular benefits on highly imbalanced data. Through accurate seizure identification, our method could facilitate widely accessible and early detection of epilepsy development, without needing expensive label collection or manual feature extraction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
