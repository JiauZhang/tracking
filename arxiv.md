        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Offloading computationally heavy tasks from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a remote server helps improve the battery life and can help reduce resource requirements. Deep learning based state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, such as object segmentation and object detection, are computationally heavy algorithms, requiring large memory and computing power. Many UAVs are using (pretrained) off-the-shelf versions of such algorithms. Offloading such power-hungry algorithms to a remote server could help UAVs save power significantly. However, deep learning based algorithms are susceptible to noise, and a wireless communication system, by its nature, introduces noise to the original signal. When the signal represents an image, noise affects the image. There has not been much work studying the effect of the noise introduced by the communication system on pretrained deep networks. In this work, we first analyze how reliable it is to offload deep learning based computer vision tasks (including both object segmentation and detection) by focusing on the effect of various parameters of a 5G wireless communication system on the transmitted image and demonstrate how the introduced noise of the used 5G wireless communication system reduces the performance of the offloaded deep learning task. Then solutions are introduced to eliminate (or reduce) the negative effect of the noise. The proposed framework starts with introducing many classical techniques as alternative solutions first, and then introduces a novel deep learning based solution to denoise the given noisy input image. The performance of various denoising algorithms on offloading both object segmentation and object detection tasks are compared. Our proposed deep transformer-based denoiser algorithm (NR-Net) yields the state-of-the-art results on reducing the negative effect of the noise in our experiments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Radio Access Networks (RANs) for telecommunications represent large agglomerations of interconnected hardware consisting of hundreds of thousands of transmitting devices (cells). Such networks undergo frequent and often heterogeneous changes caused by network operators, who are seeking to tune their system parameters for optimal performance. The effects of such changes are challenging to predict and will become even more so with the adoption of 5G/6G networks. Therefore, RAN monitoring is vital for network operators. We propose a self-supervised learning framework that leverages self-attention and self-distillation for this task. It works by detecting changes in Performance Measurement data, a collection of time-varying metrics which reflect a set of diverse measurements of the network performance at the cell level. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state of the art by 4% on a real-world based dataset consisting of about hundred thousands timeseries. It also has the merits of being scalable and generalizable. This allows it to provide deep insight into the specifics of mode of operation changes while relying minimally on expert knowledge. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Tabular data is a common form of organizing data. Multiple models are available to generate synthetic tabular datasets where observations are independent, but few have the ability to produce relational datasets. Modeling relational data is challenging as it requires modeling both a "parent" table and its relationships across tables. We introduce REaLTabFormer (Realistic Relational and Tabular Transformer), a tabular and relational synthetic data generation model. It first creates a parent table using an autoregressive GPT-2 model, then generates the relational dataset conditioned on the parent table using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model. We implement target masking to prevent data copying and propose the $Q_{\delta}$ statistic and statistical bootstrapping to detect overfitting. Experiments using real-world datasets show that REaLTabFormer captures the relational structure better than a baseline model. REaLTabFormer also achieves state-of-the-art results on prediction tasks, "out-of-the-box", for large non-relational datasets without needing fine-tuning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Precise and accurate predictions over boundary areas are essential for semantic segmentation. However, the commonly-used convolutional operators tend to smooth and blur local detail cues, making it difficult for deep models to generate accurate boundary predictions. In this paper, we introduce an operator-level approach to enhance semantic boundary awareness, so as to improve the prediction of the deep semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we first formulate the boundary feature enhancement as an anisotropic diffusion process. We then propose a novel learnable approach called semantic diffusion network (SDN) to approximate the diffusion process, which contains a parameterized semantic difference convolution operator followed by a feature fusion module. Our SDN aims to construct a differentiable mapping from the original feature to the inter-class boundary-enhanced feature. The proposed SDN is an efficient and flexible module that can be easily plugged into existing encoder-decoder segmentation models. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve consistent improvements over several typical and state-of-the-art segmentation baseline models on challenging public benchmarks. The code will be released soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) has been one of the most prominent approaches for pretraining bidirectional text encoders due to its simplicity and effectiveness. One notable concern about MLM is that the special $\texttt{[MASK]}$ symbol causes a discrepancy between pretraining data and downstream data as it is present only in pretraining but not in fine-tuning. In this work, we offer a new perspective on the consequence of such a discrepancy: We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that MLM pretraining allocates some model dimensions exclusively for representing $\texttt{[MASK]}$ tokens, resulting in a representation deficiency for real tokens and limiting the pretrained model's expressiveness when it is adapted to downstream data without $\texttt{[MASK]}$ tokens. Motivated by the identified issue, we propose MAE-LM, which pretrains the Masked Autoencoder architecture with MLM where $\texttt{[MASK]}$ tokens are excluded from the encoder. Empirically, we show that MAE-LM improves the utilization of model dimensions for real token representations, and MAE-LM consistently outperforms MLM-pretrained models across different pretraining settings and model sizes when fine-tuned on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image augmentation is a common mechanism to alleviate data scarcity in computer vision. Existing image augmentation methods often apply pre-defined transformations or mixup to augment the original image, but only locally vary the image. This makes them struggle to find a balance between maintaining semantic information and improving the diversity of augmented images. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-guided Image augmentation method with Pre-trained models (SIP). Specifically, SIP constructs prompts with image labels and captions to better guide the image-to-image generation process of the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. The semantic information contained in the original images can be well preserved, and the augmented images still maintain diversity. Experimental results show that SIP can improve two commonly used backbones, i.e., ResNet-50 and ViT, by 12.60% and 2.07% on average over seven datasets, respectively. Moreover, SIP not only outperforms the best image augmentation baseline RandAugment by 4.46% and 1.23% on two backbones, but also further improves the performance by integrating naturally with the baseline. A detailed analysis of SIP is presented, including the diversity of augmented images, an ablation study on textual prompts, and a case study on the generated images. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Currently, most existing person re-identification methods use Instance-Level features, which are extracted only from a single image. However, these Instance-Level features can easily ignore the discriminative information due to the appearance of each identity varies greatly in different images. Thus, it is necessary to exploit Identity-Level features, which can be shared across different images of each identity. In this paper, we propose to promote Instance-Level features to Identity-Level features by employing cross-attention to incorporate information from one image to another of the same identity, thus more unified and discriminative pedestrian information can be obtained. We propose a novel training framework named X-ReID. Specifically, a Cross Intra-Identity Instances module (IntraX) fuses different intra-identity instances to transfer Identity-Level knowledge and make Instance-Level features more compact. A Cross Inter-Identity Instances module (InterX) involves hard positive and hard negative instances to improve the attention response to the same identity instead of different identity, which minimizes intra-identity variation and maximizes inter-identity variation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our method over existing works. Particularly, on the challenging MSMT17, our proposed method gains 1.1% mAP improvements when compared to the second place. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to impute unobservable mental states to others, is central to human social interactions, communication, empathy, self-consciousness, and morality. We administer classic false-belief tasks, widely used to test ToM in humans, to several language models, without any examples or pre-training. Our results show that models published before 2022 show virtually no ability to solve ToM tasks. Yet, the January 2022 version of GPT-3 (davinci-002) solved 70% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of seven-year-old children. Moreover, its November 2022 version (davinci-003), solved 93% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of nine-year-old children. These findings suggest that ToM-like ability (thus far considered to be uniquely human) may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of language models' improving language skills. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human perception of the complex world relies on a comprehensive analysis of multi-modal signals, and the co-occurrences of audio and video signals provide humans with rich cues. This paper focuses on novel audio-visual scene synthesis in the real world. Given a video recording of an audio-visual scene, the task is to synthesize new videos with spatial audios along arbitrary novel camera trajectories in that audio-visual scene. Directly using a NeRF-based model for audio synthesis is insufficient due to its lack of prior knowledge and acoustic supervision. To tackle the challenges, we first propose an acoustic-aware audio generation module that integrates our prior knowledge of audio propagation into NeRF, in which we associate audio generation with the 3D geometry of the visual environment. In addition, we propose a coordinate transformation module that expresses a viewing direction relative to the sound source. Such a direction transformation helps the model learn sound source-centric acoustic fields. Moreover, we utilize a head-related impulse response function to synthesize pseudo binaural audio for data augmentation that strengthens training. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of our model on real-world audio-visual scenes. We refer interested readers to view our video results for convincing comparisons. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modelling have demonstrated exceptional performance on self-supervised representation learning, where Momentum Contrast (i.e., MoCo) and Masked AutoEncoder (i.e., MAE) are the state-of-the-art, respectively. In this work, we propose MOMA to distill from pre-trained MoCo and MAE in a self-supervised manner to collaborate the knowledge from both paradigms. We introduce three different mechanisms of knowledge transfer in the propsoed MOMA framework. : (1) Distill pre-trained MoCo to MAE. (2) Distill pre-trained MAE to MoCo (3) Distill pre-trained MoCo and MAE to a random initialized student. During the distillation, the teacher and the student are fed with original inputs and masked inputs, respectively. The learning is enabled by aligning the normalized representations from the teacher and the projected representations from the student. This simple design leads to efficient computation with extremely high mask ratio and dramatically reduced training epochs, and does not require extra considerations on the distillation target. The experiments show MOMA delivers compact student models with comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art methods, combining the power of both self-supervised learning paradigms. It presents competitive results against different benchmarks in computer vision. We hope our method provides an insight on transferring and adapting the knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models in a computationally efficient way. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The field of data visualisation has long aimed to generate visualisations from natural language text. Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of a solution which allow users to interact with data using natural language queries. However, the implementation of NLIs is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and frequent underspecification of user queries. This study proposes using large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which leverages LLMs and demonstrates how effective prompt engineering can be conducted in order to extract from LLMs the desired code for visualisations. Chat2VIS shows that the use of pre-trained LLMs together with the proposed priming prompts, offers an accurate and reliable approach to generating visualisations from natural language queries, even those that are highly misspecified and underspecified. This approach demonstrates gains in efficiency and cost reduction in the development of these systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules. The study compares the performance of two types of GPT-3 models and ChatGPT, while demonstrating that the proposed approach is secure, privacy-preserving, and generalisable to different datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformers have already revolutionized the field by utilizing an attention-based encoder-decoder model. Recently, some pioneering works have employed Transformer-like architectures in Computer Vision (CV) and they have reported outstanding performance of these architectures in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance improvements over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their competitive modelling capabilities. However, these architectures demand massive computational resources which makes these models difficult to be deployed in the resource-constrained applications. Many solutions have been developed to combat this issue, such as compressive transformers and compression functions such as dilated convolution, min-max pooling, 1D convolution, etc. Model compression has recently attracted considerable research attention as a potential remedy. A number of model compression methods have been proposed in the literature such as weight quantization, weight multiplexing, pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, techniques like weight quantization, pruning and weight multiplexing typically involve complex pipelines for performing the compression. KD has been found to be a simple and much effective model compression technique that allows a relatively simple model to perform tasks almost as accurately as a complex model. This paper discusses various approaches based upon KD for effective compression of ViT models. The paper elucidates the role played by KD in reducing the computational and memory requirements of these models. The paper also presents the various challenges faced by ViTs that are yet to be resolved. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Translation models tend to ignore the rich semantic information in triads in the process of knowledge graph complementation. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper constructs a knowledge graph complementation method that incorporates adaptively enhanced semantic information. The hidden semantic information inherent in the triad is obtained by fine-tuning the BERT model, and the attention feature embedding method is used to calculate the semantic attention scores between relations and entities in positive and negative triads and incorporate them into the structural information to form a soft constraint rule for semantic information. The rule is added to the original translation model to realize the adaptive enhancement of semantic information. In addition, the method takes into account the effect of high-dimensional vectors on the effect, and uses the BERT-whitening method to reduce the dimensionality and generate a more efficient semantic vector representation. After experimental comparison, the proposed method performs better on both FB15K and WIN18 datasets, with a numerical improvement of about 2.6% compared with the original translation model, which verifies the reasonableness and effectiveness of the method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) remains a significant yet challenging research problem in the realm of visual reasoning. A VCR model generally aims at answering a textual question regarding an image, followed by the rationale prediction for the preceding answering process. Though these two processes are sequential and intertwined, existing methods always consider them as two independent matching-based instances. They, therefore, ignore the pivotal relationship between the two processes, leading to sub-optimal model performance. This paper presents a novel visual attention alignment method to efficaciously handle these two processes in a unified framework. To achieve this, we first design a re-attention module for aggregating the vision attention map produced in each process. Thereafter, the resultant two sets of attention maps are carefully aligned to guide the two processes to make decisions based on the same image regions. We apply this method to both conventional attention and the recent Transformer models and carry out extensive experiments on the VCR benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that with the attention alignment module, our method achieves a considerable improvement over the baseline methods, evidently revealing the feasibility of the coupling of the two processes as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this study, we presented a four-level cross-domain strategy for fake news detection on pre-trained models. Cross-domain text classification is a task of a model adopting a target domain by using the knowledge of the source domain. Explainability is crucial in understanding the behaviour of these complex models. A fine-tune BERT model is used to. perform cross-domain classification with several experiments using datasets from different domains. Explanatory models like Anchor, ELI5, LIME and SHAP are used to design a novel explainable approach to cross-domain levels. The experimental analysis has given an ideal pair of XAI models on different levels of cross-domain. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Prior work has attempted to understand the internal structures and functionalities of Transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures on the level of multi-head attention and feed-forward sublayers. Interpretations have focused on the encoder and decoder, along with the combinatorial possibilities of the self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward sublayers. Could we improve the quality of translation by diving into the Transformer sublayer abstractions and permuting its layer weight matrices? We propose AEIUOrder to greedily reorder layer weight matrices in the encoder by their well-trainedness, as measured by Random Matrix Theory (RMT) metrics, and reverse the ordering scheme for the encoder. The objective is to maximize Total well-trainedness in the encoder while the decoder structure serves to represent the reverse process of encoding. On the standard Transformer (6 layers, model dimension 512), AEIUOrder achieves a BLEU score of 34.62 (baseline 34.31) on the IWSLT 2016 German-to-English translation task, and 27.95 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task (baseline 27.91). AEIUOrder is also realized on Transformers with various depths and embedding dimensions, showing significant improvements on deeper, wider models than on their shallower, slimmer counterparts. For instance, the 8-layer, 768-dimension and the 4-layer, 1024-dimension Transformers achieve respective 29.1 and 29.31 BLEU scores on the IWSLT 2016 English-to-German translation task (28.53 and 28.97 on respective baselines). Our results suggest that the RMT-motivated approach to maximize \textit{Total well-trainedness}, by greedily reordering its layer weight matrices, facilitates the model to learn representations and generate translations more effectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning aims to generate coherent captions for multiple adjacent images in a news document. There are coherence relationships among adjacent images because they often describe same entities or events. These relationships are important for entity-aware multi-image captioning, but are neglected in entity-aware single-image captioning. Most existing work focuses on single-image captioning, while multi-image captioning has not been explored before. Hence, this paper proposes a coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning model by making use of coherence relationships. The model consists of a Transformer-based caption generation model and two types of contrastive learning-based coherence mechanisms. The generation model generates the caption by paying attention to the image and the accompanying text. The horizontal coherence mechanism aims to the make the caption coherent with captions of adjacent images. The vertical coherence mechanism aims to make the caption coherent with the image and the accompanying text. To evaluate coherence between captions, two coherence evaluation metrics are proposed. The new dataset DM800K is constructed that has more images per document than two existing datasets GoodNews and NYT800K, and are more suitable for multi-image captioning. Experiments on three datasets show the proposed captioning model outperforms 6 baselines according to single-image captioning evaluations, and the generated captions are more coherent than that of baselines according to coherence evaluations and human evaluations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new method for end-to-end Video Question Answering (VideoQA), aside from the current popularity of using large-scale pre-training with huge feature extractors. We achieve this with a pyramidal multimodal transformer (PMT) model, which simply incorporates a learnable word embedding layer, a few convolutional and transformer layers. We use the anisotropic pyramid to fulfill video-language interactions across different spatio-temporal scales. In addition to the canonical pyramid, which includes both bottom-up and top-down pathways with lateral connections, novel strategies are proposed to decompose the visual feature stream into spatial and temporal sub-streams at different scales and implement their interactions with the linguistic semantics while preserving the integrity of local and global semantics. We demonstrate better or on-par performances with high computational efficiency against state-of-the-art methods on five VideoQA benchmarks. Our ablation study shows the scalability of our model that achieves competitive results for text-to-video retrieval by leveraging feature extractors with reusable pre-trained weights, and also the effectiveness of the pyramid. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper addresses the task of extending a given synset with additional synonyms taking into account synonymy strength as a fuzzy value. Given a mono/multilingual synset and a threshold (a fuzzy value [0-1]), our goal is to extract new synonyms above this threshold from existing lexicons. We present twofold contributions: an algorithm and a benchmark dataset. The dataset consists of 3K candidate synonyms for 500 synsets. Each candidate synonym is annotated with a fuzzy value by four linguists. The dataset is important for (i) understanding how much linguists (dis/)agree on synonymy, in addition to (ii) using the dataset as a baseline to evaluate our algorithm. Our proposed algorithm extracts synonyms from existing lexicons and computes a fuzzy value for each candidate. Our evaluations show that the algorithm behaves like a linguist and its fuzzy values are close to those proposed by linguists (using RMSE and MAE).

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image deblurring aims to recover the latent sharp image from its blurry counterpart and has a wide range of applications in computer vision. The Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed well in this domain for many years, and until recently an alternative network architecture, namely Transformer, has demonstrated even stronger performance. One can attribute its superiority to the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism, which offers a larger receptive field and better input content adaptability than CNNs. However, as MHSA demands high computational costs that grow quadratically with respect to the input resolution, it becomes impractical for high-resolution image deblurring tasks. In this work, we propose a unified lightweight CNN network that features a large effective receptive field (ERF) and demonstrates comparable or even better performance than Transformers while bearing less computational costs. Our key design is an efficient CNN block dubbed LaKD, equipped with a large kernel depth-wise convolution and spatial-channel mixing structure, attaining comparable or larger ERF than Transformers but with a smaller parameter scale. Specifically, we achieve +0.17dB / +0.43dB PSNR over the state-of-the-art Restormer on defocus / motion deblurring benchmark datasets with 32% fewer parameters and 39% fewer MACs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our network and the effectiveness of each module. Furthermore, we propose a compact and intuitive ERFMeter metric that quantitatively characterizes ERF, and shows a high correlation to the network performance. We hope this work can inspire the research community to further explore the pros and cons of CNN and Transformer architectures beyond image deblurring tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As an emerging technique, vertical federated learning collaborates with different data sources to jointly train a machine learning model without data exchange. However, federated learning is computationally expensive and inefficient in modeling due to complex encryption algorithms and secure computation protocols. Split learning offers an alternative solution to circumvent these challenges. Despite this, vanilla split learning still suffers privacy leakage. Here, we propose the Generative Adversarial Federated Model (GAFM), which integrates the vanilla split learning framework with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for protection against label leakage from gradients in binary classification tasks. We compare our proposal to existing models, including Marvell, Max Norm, and SplitNN, on three publicly available datasets, where GAFM shows significant improvement regarding the trade-off between classification accuracy and label privacy protection. We also provide heuristic justification for why GAFM can improve over baselines and demonstrate that GAFM offers label protection through gradient perturbation compared to SplitNN. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we define a diffusion-based generative model capable of both music synthesis and source separation by learning the score of the joint probability density of sources sharing a context. Alongside the classic total inference tasks (i.e. generating a mixture, separating the sources), we also introduce and experiment on the partial inference task of source imputation, where we generate a subset of the sources given the others (e.g., play a piano track that goes well with the drums). Additionally, we introduce a novel inference method for the separation task. We train our model on Slakh2100, a standard dataset for musical source separation, provide qualitative results in the generation settings, and showcase competitive quantitative results in the separation setting. Our method is the first example of a single model that can handle both generation and separation tasks, thus representing a step toward general audio models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While score based generative models, or diffusion models, have found success in image synthesis, they are often coupled with text data or image label to be able to manipulate and conditionally generate images. Even though manipulation of images by changing the text prompt is possible, our understanding of the text embedding and our ability to modify it to edit images is quite limited. Towards the direction of having more control over image manipulation and conditional generation, we propose to learn image components in an unsupervised manner so that we can compose those components to generate and manipulate images in informed manner. Taking inspiration from energy based models, we interpret different score components as the gradient of different energy functions. We show how score based learning allows us to learn interesting components and we can visualize them through generation. We also show how this novel decomposition allows us to compose, generate and modify images in interesting ways akin to dreaming.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The design of novel protein structures remains a challenge in protein engineering for applications across biomedicine and chemistry. In this line of work, a diffusion model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, FrameDiff, for learning the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods. We find our samples are capable of generalizing beyond any known protein structure. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models are able to generate photorealistic images in arbitrary scenes. However, when applying diffusion models to image translation, there exists a trade-off between maintaining spatial structure and high-quality content. Besides, existing methods are mainly based on test-time optimization or fine-tuning model for each input image, which are extremely time-consuming for practical applications. To address these issues, we propose a new approach for flexible image translation by learning a layout-aware image condition together with a text condition. Specifically, our method co-encodes images and text into a new domain during the training phase. In the inference stage, we can choose images/text or both as the conditions for each time step, which gives users more flexible control over layout and content. Experimental comparisons of our method with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our model performs best in both style image translation and semantic image translation and took the shortest time. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models show promising generation capability for a variety of data. Despite their high generation quality, the inference for diffusion models is still time-consuming due to the numerous sampling iterations required. To accelerate the inference, we propose ReDi, a simple yet learning-free Retrieval-based Diffusion sampling framework. From a precomputed knowledge base, ReDi retrieves a trajectory similar to the partially generated trajectory at an early stage of generation, skips a large portion of intermediate steps, and continues sampling from a later step in the retrieved trajectory. We theoretically prove that the generation performance of ReDi is guaranteed. Our experiments demonstrate that ReDi improves the model inference efficiency by 2x speedup. Furthermore, ReDi is able to generalize well in zero-shot cross-domain image generation such as image stylization. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large generative AI models (LGAIMs), such as ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. The paper proceeds in three steps, covering (1) direct regulation, (2) content moderation, and (3) policy proposals. It finishes by making two distinct policy proposals to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. First, rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. In particular, concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, should be the object of high-risk obligations. Moreover, detailed transparency obligations are warranted. Non-discrimination provisions may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Second, the core of the DSA content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers. In all areas, regulators and lawmakers need to act fast to keep track with the dynamics of ChatGPT et al. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have recently exhibited remarkable abilities to synthesize striking image samples since the introduction of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Their key idea is to disrupt images into noise through a fixed forward process and learn its reverse process to generate samples from noise in a denoising way. For conditional DDPMs, most existing practices relate conditions only to the reverse process and fit it to the reversal of unconditional forward process. We find this will limit the condition modeling and generation in a small time window. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible conditional diffusion model by introducing conditions into the forward process. We utilize extra latent space to allocate an exclusive diffusion trajectory for each condition based on some shifting rules, which will disperse condition modeling to all timesteps and improve the learning capacity of model. We formulate our method, which we call \textbf{ShiftDDPMs}, and provide a unified point of view on existing related methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on image synthesis demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of ShiftDDPMs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Communication-reduction techniques are a popular way to improve scalability in data-parallel training of deep neural networks (DNNs). The recent emergence of large language models such as GPT has created the need for new approaches to exploit data-parallelism. Among these, fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP) training is highly popular, yet it still encounters scalability bottlenecks. One reason is that applying compression techniques to FSDP is challenging: as the vast majority of the communication involves the model's weights, direct compression alters convergence and leads to accuracy loss. We present QSDP, a variant of FSDP which supports both gradient and weight quantization with theoretical guarantees, is simple to implement and has essentially no overheads. To derive QSDP we prove that a natural modification of SGD achieves convergence even when we only maintain quantized weights, and thus the domain over which we train consists of quantized points and is, therefore, highly non-convex. We validate this approach by training GPT-family models with up to 1.3 billion parameters on a multi-node cluster. Experiments show that QSDP preserves model accuracy, while completely removing the communication bottlenecks of FSDP, providing end-to-end speedups of up to 2.2x. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recent success of text-to-image generation diffusion models has also revolutionized semantic image editing, enabling the manipulation of images based on query/target texts. Despite these advancements, a significant challenge lies in the potential introduction of prior bias in pre-trained models during image editing, e.g., making unexpected modifications to inappropriate regions. To this point, we present a novel Dual-Cycle Diffusion model that addresses the issue of prior bias by generating an unbiased mask as the guidance of image editing. The proposed model incorporates a Bias Elimination Cycle that consists of both a forward path and an inverted path, each featuring a Structural Consistency Cycle to ensure the preservation of image content during the editing process. The forward path utilizes the pre-trained model to produce the edited image, while the inverted path converts the result back to the source image. The unbiased mask is generated by comparing differences between the processed source image and the edited image to ensure that both conform to the same distribution. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as it significantly improves the D-CLIP score from 0.272 to 0.283.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In supervised learning for image denoising, usually the paired clean images and noisy images are collected or synthesised to train a denoising model. L2 norm loss or other distance functions are used as the objective function for training. It often leads to an over-smooth result with less image details. In this paper, we regard the denoising task as a problem of estimating the posterior distribution of clean images conditioned on noisy images. We apply the idea of diffusion model to realize generative image denoising. According to the noise model in denoising tasks, we redefine the diffusion process such that it is different from the original one. Hence, the sampling of the posterior distribution is a reverse process of dozens of steps from the noisy image. We consider three types of noise model, Gaussian, Gamma and Poisson noise. With the guarantee of theory, we derive a unified strategy for model training. Our method is verified through experiments on three types of noise models and achieves excellent performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to generate new objects such as images and texts from a given dataset. This ability has led to a wide range of applications. While standard tasks often require sampling from high-density regions in the latent space, there are also tasks that require sampling from low-density regions, such as Morphing and Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LS-BO). These tasks are becoming increasingly important in fields such as de novo molecular design, where the ability to generate diverse and high-quality chemical compounds is essential. In this study, we investigate the issue of low-quality objects generated from low-density regions in VAEs. To address this problem, we propose a new VAE model, the Latent Reconstruction-Aware VAE (LRA-VAE). The LRA-VAE model takes into account what we refer to as the Latent Reconstruction Error (LRE) of the latent variables. We evaluate our proposal using Morphing and LS-BO experiments, and show that LRA-VAE can improve the quality of generated objects over the other approaches, making it a promising solution for various generation tasks that involve sampling from low-density regions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reconstructing interacting hands from a single RGB image is a very challenging task. On the one hand, severe mutual occlusion and similar local appearance between two hands confuse the extraction of visual features, resulting in the misalignment of estimated hand meshes and the image. On the other hand, there are complex interaction patterns between interacting hands, which significantly increases the solution space of hand poses and increases the difficulty of network learning. In this paper, we propose a decoupled iterative refinement framework to achieve pixel-alignment hand reconstruction while efficiently modeling the spatial relationship between hands. Specifically, we define two feature spaces with different characteristics, namely 2D visual feature space and 3D joint feature space. First, we obtain joint-wise features from the visual feature map and utilize a graph convolution network and a transformer to perform intra- and inter-hand information interaction in the 3D joint feature space, respectively. Then, we project the joint features with global information back into the 2D visual feature space in an obfuscation-free manner and utilize the 2D convolution for pixel-wise enhancement. By performing multiple alternate enhancements in the two feature spaces, our method can achieve an accurate and robust reconstruction of interacting hands. Our method outperforms all existing two-hand reconstruction methods by a large margin on the InterHand2.6M dataset. Meanwhile, our method shows a strong generalization ability for in-the-wild images. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

However, and although the quality of the generated images is unprecedented, these methods seem to struggle when trying to generate specific image compositions. In this paper we present Mixture of Diffusers, an algorithm that builds over existing diffusion models to provide a more detailed control over composition. By harmonizing several diffusion processes acting on different regions of a canvas, it allows generating larger images, where the location of each object and style is controlled by a separate diffusion process. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Dot-product attention mechanism plays a crucial role in modern deep architectures (e.g., Transformer) for sequence modeling, however, na\"ive exact computation of this model incurs quadratic time and memory complexities in sequence length, hindering the training of long-sequence models. Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, and an efficient KDE solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that KDEformer outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models. On BigGAN image generation, we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over $4\times$ speedup. For ImageNet classification with T2T-ViT, KDEformer shows over $18\times$ speedup while the accuracy drop is less than $0.5\%$. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This paper examines how a text generation model, GPT-2, accentuates pre-existing societal biases about country-based demonyms. We generate stories using GPT-2 for various nationalities and use sensitivity analysis to explore how the number of internet users and the country's economic status impacts the sentiment of the stories. To reduce the propagation of biases through large language models (LLM), we explore the debiasing method of adversarial triggering. Our results show that GPT-2 demonstrates significant bias against countries with lower internet users, and adversarial triggering effectively reduces the same. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Open vocabulary models (e.g. CLIP) have shown strong performance on zero-shot classification through their ability generate embeddings for each class based on their (natural language) names. Prior work has focused on improving the accuracy of these models through prompt engineering or by incorporating a small amount of labeled downstream data (via finetuning). However, there has been little focus on improving the richness of the class names themselves, which can pose issues when class labels are coarsely-defined and uninformative. We propose Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative strategy for zero-shot classification specifically designed for datasets with implicit semantic hierarchies. CHiLS proceeds in three steps: (i) for each class, produce a set of subclasses, using either existing label hierarchies or by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP procedure as though these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the predicted subclass back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous datasets with underlying hierarchical structure, CHiLS leads to improved accuracy in situations both with and without ground-truth hierarchical information. CHiLS is simple to implement within existing CLIP pipelines and requires no additional training cost.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Materials informatics (MI), which uses artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques to improve the efficiency of materials development, is attracting increasing interest from industry. One of its main applications is the rapid development of new high-performance compounds. Recently, several deep generative models have been proposed to suggest candidate compounds that are expected to satisfy the desired performance. However, they usually have the problem of requiring a large amount of experimental datasets for training to achieve sufficient accuracy. In actual cases, it is often possible to accumulate only about 1000 experimental data at most. Therefore, the authors proposed a deep generative model with nested two variational autoencoders (VAEs). The outer VAE learns the structural features of compounds using large-scale public data, while the inner VAE learns the relationship between the latent variables of the outer VAE and the properties from small-scale experimental data. To generate high performance compounds beyond the range of the training data, the authors also proposed a loss function that amplifies the correlation between a component of latent variables of the inner VAE and material properties. The results indicated that this loss function contributes to improve the probability of generating high-performance candidates. Furthermore, as a result of verification test with an actual customer in chemical industry, it was confirmed that the proposed method is effective in reducing the number of experiments to $1/4$ compared to a conventional method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion auction design is a new trend in mechanism design for which the main goal is to incentivize existing buyers to invite new buyers, who are their neighbors on a social network, to join an auction even though they are competitors. With more buyers, a diffusion auction will be able to give a more efficient allocation and receive higher revenue. Existing studies have proposed many interesting diffusion auctions to attract more buyers, but the seller's revenue is not optimized. Hence, in this study, we investigate what optimal revenue the seller can achieve by attracting more buyers. In traditional single-item auctions, Myerson has proposed a mechanism to achieve optimal revenue. However, in the network setting, we prove that a globally optimal mechanism for all structures does not exist. Instead, we show that given a structure, we have a mechanism to get the optimal revenue under this structure only. Since a globally optimal mechanism does not exist, our next goal is to design a mechanism that has a bounded approximation of the optimal revenue in all structures. The approximation of all the early diffusion auctions is zero, and we propose the first mechanism with a non-zero approximation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Finite difference method as a popular numerical method has been widely used to solve fractional diffusion equations. In the general spatial error analyses, an assumption $u\in C^{4}(\bar{\Omega})$ is needed to preserve $\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$ convergence when using central finite difference scheme to solve fractional sub-diffusion equation with Laplace operator, but this assumption is somewhat strong, where $u$ is the exact solution and $h$ is the mesh size. In this paper, a novel analysis technique is proposed to show that the spatial convergence rate can reach $\mathcal{O}(h^{\min(\sigma+\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon,2)})$ in both $l^{2}$-norm and $l^{\infty}$-norm in one-dimensional domain when the initial value and source term are both in $\hat{H}^{\sigma}(\Omega)$ but without any regularity assumption on the exact solution, where $\sigma\geq 0$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$ being arbitrarily small. After making slight modifications on the scheme, acting on the initial value and source term, the spatial convergence rate can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$ in $l^{2}$-norm and $\mathcal{O}(h^{\min(\sigma+\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon,2)})$ in $l^{\infty}$-norm. It's worth mentioning that our spatial error analysis is applicable to high dimensional cube domain by using the properties of tensor product. Moreover, two kinds of averaged schemes are provided to approximate the Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative, and $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{2})$ convergence is obtained for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$. Finally, some numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the built theory. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multi-scenario ad ranking aims at leveraging the data from multiple domains or channels for training a unified ranking model to improve the performance at each individual scenario. Although the research on this task has made important progress, it still lacks the consideration of cross-scenario relations, thus leading to limitation in learning capability and difficulty in interrelation modeling. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Contrastive Constrained approach (HC^2) for multi-scenario ad ranking. To enhance the modeling of data interrelation, we elaborately design a hybrid contrastive learning approach to capture commonalities and differences among multiple scenarios. The core of our approach consists of two elaborated contrastive losses, namely generalized and individual contrastive loss, which aim at capturing common knowledge and scenario-specific knowledge, respectively. To adapt contrastive learning to the complex multi-scenario setting, we propose a series of important improvements. For generalized contrastive loss, we enhance contrastive learning by extending the contrastive samples (label-aware and diffusion noise enhanced contrastive samples) and reweighting the contrastive samples (reciprocal similarity weighting). For individual contrastive loss, we use the strategies of dropout-based augmentation and {cross-scenario encoding} for generating meaningful positive and negative contrastive samples, respectively. Extensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online test have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed HC$^2$ by comparing it with a number of competitive baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) generation aims to generate scene graph representations based on panoptic segmentation instead of rigid bounding boxes. Existing PSG methods utilize one-stage paradigm which simultaneously generates scene graphs and predicts semantic segmentation masks or two-stage paradigm that first adopt an off-the-shelf panoptic segmentor, then pairwise relationship prediction between these predicted objects. One-stage approach despite having a simplified training paradigm, its segmentation results are usually under-satisfactory, while two-stage approach lacks global context and leads to low performance on relation prediction. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose GRNet, a Global Relation Network in two-stage paradigm, where the pre-extracted local object features and their corresponding masks are fed into a transformer with class embeddings. To handle relation ambiguity and predicate classification bias caused by long-tailed distribution, we formulate relation prediction in the second stage as a multi-class classification task with soft label. We conduct comprehensive experiments on OpenPSG dataset and achieve the state-of-art performance on the leadboard. We also show the effectiveness of our soft label strategy for long-tailed classes in ablation studies.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning from human preferences is important for language models to be helpful and useful for humans, and to align with human and social values. Existing works focus on supervised finetuning of pretrained models, based on curated model generations that are preferred by human labelers. Such works have achieved remarkable successes in understanding and following instructions (e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT, etc). However, to date, a key limitation of supervised finetuning is that it cannot learn from negative ratings; models are only trained on positive-rated data, which makes it data inefficient. Because collecting human feedback data is both time consuming and expensive, it is vital for the model to learn from all feedback, akin to the remarkable ability of humans to learn from diverse feedback. In this work, we propose a novel technique called Hindsight Finetuning for making language models learn from diverse human feedback. In fact, our idea is motivated by how humans learn from hindsight experience. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with hindsight feedback, and finetune the model to predict the most preferred output. By doing so, models can learn to identify and correct negative attributes or errors. Applying the method to GPT-J, we observe that it significantly improves results on summarization and dialogue tasks using the same amount of human feedback. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The numerical experiments we led allow us to formulate a conjecture on the \textit{a priori} error estimates depending on the two parameters $r$ and $k$. In addition, these error estimates rely on the definition of a functional \textit{lift} with adapted properties on the boundary to move numerical solutions defined on the computational domain to the physical one. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Depression is a widespread mental health issue, affecting an estimated 3.8% of the global population. It is also one of the main contributors to disability worldwide. Recently it is becoming popular for individuals to use social media platforms (e.g., Reddit) to express their difficulties and health issues (e.g., depression) and seek support from other users in online communities. It opens great opportunities to automatically identify social media users with depression by parsing millions of posts for potential interventions. Deep learning methods have begun to dominate in the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) because of their ease of use, efficient processing, and state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning model which combines a pretrained sentence BERT (SBERT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect individuals with depression with their Reddit posts. The sentence BERT is used to learn the meaningful representation of semantic information in each post. CNN enables the further transformation of those embeddings and the temporal identification of behavioral patterns of users. We trained and evaluated the model performance to identify Reddit users with depression by utilizing the Self-reported Mental Health Diagnoses (SMHD) data. The hybrid deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86 and outperformed the state-of-the-art documented result (F1 score of 0.79) by other machine learning models in the literature. The results show the feasibility of the hybrid model to identify individuals with depression. Although the hybrid model is validated to detect depression with Reddit posts, it can be easily tuned and applied to other text classification tasks and different clinical applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

This paper presents a study in which ChatGPT was used to generate a construction schedule for a simple construction project. The output from ChatGPT was evaluated by a pool of participants that provided feedback regarding their overall interaction experience and the quality of the output. The results show that ChatGPT can generate a coherent schedule that follows a logical approach to fulfill the requirements of the scope indicated. The participants had an overall positive interaction experience and indicated the great potential of such a tool to automate many preliminary and time-consuming tasks. However, the technology still has limitations, and further development is needed before it can be widely adopted in the industry. Overall, this study highlights the potential of using large language models in the construction industry and the need for further research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Solving high-dimensional random parametric PDEs poses a challenging computational problem. It is well-known that numerical methods can greatly benefit from adaptive refinement algorithms, in particular when functional approximations in polynomials are computed as in stochastic Galerkin and stochastic collocations methods. This work investigates a residual based adaptive algorithm used to approximate the solution of the stationary diffusion equation with lognormal coefficients. It is known that the refinement procedure is reliable, but the theoretical convergence of the scheme for this class of unbounded coefficients has long been an open question. This paper fills this gap and in particular provides a convergence results for the adaptive solution of the lognormal stationary diffusion problem. A computational example supports the theoretical statement. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a finite element scheme for fractional diffusion problems with varying diffusivity and fractional order. We consider a symmetric integral form of these nonlocal equations defined on general geometries and in arbitrary bounded domains. A number of challenges are encountered when discretizing these equations. The first comes from the heterogeneous kernel singularity in the fractional integral operator. The second comes from the dense discrete operator with its quadratic growth in memory footprint and arithmetic operations. An additional challenge comes from the need to handle volume conditions-the generalization of classical local boundary conditions to the nonlocal setting. Satisfying these conditions requires that the effect of the whole domain, including both the interior and exterior regions, can be computed on every interior point in the discretization. Performed directly, this would result in quadratic complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a strategy that decomposes the stiffness matrix into three components. The first is a sparse matrix that handles the singular near-field separately and is computed by adapting singular quadrature techniques available for the homogeneous case to the case of spatially variable order. The second component handles the remaining smooth part of the near-field as well as the far-field and is approximated by a hierarchical $\mathcal{H}^{2}$ matrix that maintains linear complexity in storage and operations. The third component handles the effect of the global mesh at every node and is written as a weighted mass matrix whose density is computed by a fast-multipole type method. The resulting algorithm has therefore overall linear space and time complexity. Analysis of the consistency of the stiffness matrix is provided and numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image-text retrieval (ITR) is a task to retrieve the relevant images/texts, given the query from another modality. The conventional dense retrieval paradigm relies on encoding images and texts into dense representations using dual-stream encoders, however, it faces challenges with low retrieval speed in large-scale retrieval scenarios. In this work, we propose the lexicon-weighting paradigm, where sparse representations in vocabulary space are learned for images and texts to take advantage of the bag-of-words models and efficient inverted indexes, resulting in significantly reduced retrieval latency. A crucial gap arises from the continuous nature of image data, and the requirement for a sparse vocabulary space representation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pre-training framework, Lexicon-Bottlenecked Language-Image Pre-Training (LexLIP), that learns importance-aware lexicon representations. This framework features lexicon-bottlenecked modules between the dual-stream encoders and weakened text decoders, allowing for constructing continuous bag-of-words bottlenecks to learn lexicon-importance distributions. Upon pre-training with same-scale data, our LexLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark ITR datasets, MSCOCO and Flickr30k. Furthermore, in large-scale retrieval scenarios, LexLIP outperforms CLIP with a 5.5 ~ 221.3X faster retrieval speed and 13.2 ~ 48.8X less index storage memory. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Transformers, have shown great promise in a variety of applications, including image and speech synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. However, when applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications. This paper doubles as a review and a practical guide to evaluation metrics for deep generative models (DGMs) in engineering design. We first summarize well-accepted `classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded in machine learning theory and typical computer science applications. Using case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established alternatives. Next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating deep generative models. These metrics focus on unique requirements in design and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance, novelty, and conditioning. We structure our review and discussion as a set of practical selection criteria and usage guidelines. Throughout our discussion, we apply the metrics to models trained on simple 2-dimensional example problems. Finally, to illustrate the selection process and classic usage of the presented metrics, we evaluate three deep generative models on a multifaceted bicycle frame design problem considering performance target achievement, design novelty, and geometric constraints. We publicly release the code for the datasets, models, and metrics used throughout the paper at decode.mit.edu/projects/metrics/. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We show that the canonical approach for training differentially private GANs -- updating the discriminator with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) -- can yield significantly improved results after modifications to training. Existing instantiations of this approach neglect to consider how adding noise only to discriminator updates disrupts the careful balance between the generator and discriminator necessary for successful GAN training. We show that a simple fix -- taking more discriminator steps between generator steps -- restores parity and improves results. Additionally, with the goal of restoring parity between the generator and discriminator, we experiment with other modifications to improve discriminator training and see further improvements in generation quality. Our results demonstrate that on standard benchmarks, DPSGD outperforms all alternative GAN privatization schemes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This study explores the use of the Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (DirVAE) for learning disentangled latent representations of chest X-ray (CXR) images. Our working hypothesis is that distributional sparsity, as facilitated by the Dirichlet prior, will encourage disentangled feature learning for the complex task of multi-label classification of CXR images. The DirVAE is trained using CXR images from the CheXpert database, and the predictive capacity of multi-modal latent representations learned by DirVAE models is investigated through implementation of an auxiliary multi-label classification task, with a view to enforce separation of latent factors according to class-specific features. The predictive performance and explainability of the latent space learned using the DirVAE were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed, respectively, and compared with a standard Gaussian prior-VAE (GVAE). We introduce a new approach for explainable multi-label classification in which we conduct gradient-guided latent traversals for each class of interest. Study findings indicate that the DirVAE is able to disentangle latent factors into class-specific visual features, a property not afforded by the GVAE, and achieve a marginal increase in predictive performance relative to GVAE. We generate visual examples to show that our explainability method, when applied to the trained DirVAE, is able to highlight regions in CXR images that are clinically relevant to the class(es) of interest and additionally, can identify cases where classification relies on spurious feature correlations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-guided generative diffusion models unlock powerful image creation and editing tools. While these have been extended to video generation, current approaches that edit the content of existing footage while retaining structure require expensive re-training for every input or rely on error-prone propagation of image edits across frames. In this work, we present a structure and content-guided video diffusion model that edits videos based on visual or textual descriptions of the desired output. Conflicts between user-provided content edits and structure representations occur due to insufficient disentanglement between the two aspects. As a solution, we show that training on monocular depth estimates with varying levels of detail provides control over structure and content fidelity. Our model is trained jointly on images and videos which also exposes explicit control of temporal consistency through a novel guidance method. Our experiments demonstrate a wide variety of successes; fine-grained control over output characteristics, customization based on a few reference images, and a strong user preference towards results by our model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Moreover, we show that the attention weights learned by the Transformer correlate with the population receptive fields. Our model thus sets a new benchmark for neural response prediction and captures characteristic features of the visual cortex. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent vision transformer based video models mostly follow the ``image pre-training then finetuning" paradigm and have achieved great success on multiple video benchmarks. However, full finetuning such a video model could be computationally expensive and unnecessary, given the pre-trained image transformer models have demonstrated exceptional transferability. In this work, we propose a novel method to Adapt pre-trained Image Models (AIM) for efficient video understanding. By freezing the pre-trained image model and adding a few lightweight Adapters, we introduce spatial adaptation, temporal adaptation and joint adaptation to gradually equip an image model with spatiotemporal reasoning capability. We show that our proposed AIM can achieve competitive or even better performance than prior arts with substantially fewer tunable parameters on four video action recognition benchmarks. Thanks to its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to different image pre-trained models, which has the potential to leverage more powerful image foundation models in the future.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown their remarkable ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it is hard for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. In this work, we propose pix2pix-zero, an image-to-image translation method that can preserve the content of the original image without manual prompting. We first automatically discover editing directions that reflect desired edits in the text embedding space. To preserve the general content structure after editing, we further propose cross-attention guidance, which aims to retain the cross-attention maps of the input image throughout the diffusion process. In addition, our method does not need additional training for these edits and can directly use the existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our method outperforms existing and concurrent works for both real and synthetic image editing. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Purpose: Most computer vision models are developed based on either convolutional neural network (CNN) or transformer, while the former (latter) method captures local (global) features. To relieve model performance limitations due to the lack of global (local) features, we develop a novel classification network named CECT by controllable ensemble CNN and transformer. Methods: The proposed CECT is composed of a CNN-based encoder block, a deconvolution-ensemble decoder block, and a transformer-based classification block. Different from conventional CNN- or transformer-based methods, our CECT can capture features at both multi-local and global scales, and the contribution of local features at different scales can be controlled with the proposed ensemble coefficients. Results: We evaluate CECT on two public COVID-19 datasets and it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on all evaluation metrics. Conclusion: With remarkable feature capture ability, we believe CECT can also be used in other medical image classification scenarios to assist the diagnosis. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Representational drift refers to over-time changes in neural activation accompanied by a stable task performance. Despite being observed in the brain and in artificial networks, the mechanisms of drift and its implications are not fully understood. Motivated by recent experimental findings of stimulus-dependent drift in the piriform cortex, we use theory and simulations to study this phenomenon in a two-layer linear feedforward network. Specifically, in a continual learning scenario, we study the drift induced by the noise inherent in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By decomposing the learning dynamics into the normal and tangent spaces of the minimum-loss manifold, we show the former correspond to a finite variance fluctuation, while the latter could be considered as an effective diffusion process on the manifold. We analytically compute the fluctuation and the diffusion coefficients for the stimuli representations in the hidden layer as a function of network parameters and input distribution. Further, consistent with experiments, we show that the drift rate is slower for a more frequently presented stimulus. Overall, our analysis yields a theoretical framework for better understanding of the drift phenomenon in biological and artificial neural networks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We consider a shape optimization based method for finding the best interpolation data in the compression of images with noise. The aim is to reconstruct missing regions by means of minimizing a data fitting term in an $L^p$-norm between original images and their reconstructed counterparts using linear diffusion PDE-based inpainting. Reformulating the problem as a constrained optimization over sets (shapes), we derive the topological asymptotic expansion of the considered shape functionals with respect to the insertion of small ball (a single pixel) using the adjoint method. Based on the achieved distributed topological shape derivatives, we propose a numerical approach to determine the optimal set and present numerical experiments showing, the efficiency of our method. Numerical computations are presented that confirm the usefulness of our theoretical findings for PDE-based image compression. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-world non-mydriatic retinal fundus photography is prone to artifacts, imperfections and low-quality when certain ocular or systemic co-morbidities exist. Artifacts may result in inaccuracy or ambiguity in clinical diagnoses. In this paper, we proposed a simple but effective end-to-end framework for enhancing poor-quality retinal fundus images. Leveraging the optimal transport theory, we proposed an unpaired image-to-image translation scheme for transporting low-quality images to their high-quality counterparts. We theoretically proved that a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model with a generator and discriminator is sufficient for this task. Furthermore, to mitigate the inconsistency of information between the low-quality images and their enhancements, an information consistency mechanism was proposed to maximally maintain structural consistency (optical discs, blood vessels, lesions) between the source and enhanced domains. Extensive experiments were conducted on the EyeQ dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method perceptually and quantitatively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common and life-saving medical imaging technique. However, acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio MRI scans requires long scan times, resulting in increased costs and patient discomfort, and decreased throughput. Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. Here, we propose Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM$^2$), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain. We conduct experiments on 4 real-world in-vivo diffusion MRI datasets and show that our DDM$^2$ demonstrates superior denoising performances ascertained with clinically-relevant visual qualitative and quantitative metrics. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
