        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper we propose a novel approach for combining first-stage lexical retrieval models and Transformer-based re-rankers: we inject the relevance score of the lexical model as a token in the middle of the input of the cross-encoder re-ranker. It was shown in prior work that interpolation between the relevance score of lexical and BERT-based re-rankers may not consistently result in higher effectiveness. Our idea is motivated by the finding that BERT models can capture numeric information. We compare several representations of the BM25 score and inject them as text in the input of four different cross-encoders. We additionally analyze the effect for different query types, and investigate the effectiveness of our method for capturing exact matching relevance. Evaluation on the MSMARCO Passage collection and the TREC DL collections shows that the proposed method significantly improves over all cross-encoder re-rankers as well as the common interpolation methods. We show that the improvement is consistent for all query types. We also find an improvement in exact matching capabilities over both BM25 and the cross-encoders. Our findings indicate that cross-encoder re-rankers can efficiently be improved without additional computational burden and extra steps in the pipeline by explicitly adding the output of the first-stage ranker to the model input, and this effect is robust for different models and query types. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, a new perspective is suggested for unsupervised Ontology Matching (OM) or Ontology Alignment (OA) by treating it as a translation task. Ontologies are represented as graphs, and the translation is performed from a node in the source ontology graph to a path in the target ontology graph. The proposed framework, Truveta Mapper (TM), leverages a multi-task sequence-to-sequence transformer model to perform alignment across multiple ontologies in a zero-shot, unified and end-to-end manner. Multi-tasking enables the model to implicitly learn the relationship between different ontologies via transfer-learning without requiring any explicit cross-ontology manually labeled data. This also enables the formulated framework to outperform existing solutions for both runtime latency and alignment quality. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned only on publicly available text corpus and inner-ontologies data. The proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, Edit-Similarity, LogMap, AML, BERTMap, and the recently presented new OM frameworks in Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI22), offers log-linear complexity in contrast to quadratic in the existing end-to-end methods, and overall makes the OM task efficient and more straightforward without much post-processing involving mapping extension or mapping repair. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce a novel setting, wherein an agent needs to learn a task from a demonstration of a related task with the difference between the tasks communicated in natural language. The proposed setting allows reusing demonstrations from other tasks, by providing low effort language descriptions, and can also be used to provide feedback to correct agent errors, which are both important desiderata for building intelligent agents that assist humans in daily tasks. To enable progress in this proposed setting, we create two benchmarks -- Room Rearrangement and Room Navigation -- that cover a diverse set of task adaptations. Further, we propose a framework that uses a transformer-based model to reason about the entities in the tasks and their relationships, to learn a policy for the target task <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) dominate almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, they still make mistakes from time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing these mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences. Previous works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus on fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an accurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI services, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if not corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as soon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into Sequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods. Our study shows that most current ME methods could yield unsatisfying results in this scenario. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor that can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and training a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental results on both classification and generation tasks show that Transformer-Patcher can successively correct up to thousands of errors (Reliability) and generalize to their equivalent inputs (Generality) while retaining the model's accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality). Our method outperforms previous fine-tuning and HyperNetwork-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for Sequential Model Editing (SME).

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While pre-trained language models can generate individually fluent sentences for automatic story generation, they struggle to generate stories that are coherent, sensible and interesting. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) story generation models explore using higher-level features such as plots or commonsense knowledge to improve the quality of generated stories. Prompt-based learning using very large pre-trained language models (VLPLMs) such as GPT3 has demonstrated impressive performance even across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we present an extensive study using automatic and human evaluation to compare the story generation capability of VLPLMs to those SOTA models in three different datasets where stories differ in style, register and length. Our results show that VLPLMs generate much higher quality stories than other story generation models, and to a certain extent rival human authors, although preliminary investigation also reveals that they tend to ``plagiarise'' real stories in scenarios that involve world knowledge. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-supervised pretraining has been extensively studied in language and vision domains, where a unified model can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks by pretraining representations without explicit labels. When it comes to sequential decision-making tasks, however, it is difficult to properly design such a pretraining approach that can cope with both high-dimensional perceptual information and the complexity of sequential control over long interaction horizons. The challenge becomes combinatorially more complex if we want to pretrain representations amenable to a large variety of tasks. To tackle this problem, in this work, we formulate a general pretraining-finetuning pipeline for sequential decision making, under which we propose a generic pretraining framework \textit{Self-supervised Multi-task pretrAining with contRol Transformer (SMART)}. By systematically investigating pretraining regimes, we carefully design a Control Transformer (CT) coupled with a novel control-centric pretraining objective in a self-supervised manner. SMART encourages the representation to capture the common essential information relevant to short-term control and long-term control, which is transferrable across tasks. We show by extensive experiments in DeepMind Control Suite that SMART significantly improves the learning efficiency among seen and unseen downstream tasks and domains under different learning scenarios including Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Benefiting from the proposed control-centric objective, SMART is resilient to distribution shift between pretraining and finetuning, and even works well with low-quality pretraining datasets that are randomly collected. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, T5, GPT, etc.) has proven to be one of the most promising paradigms in recent NLP research. However, numerous recent works indicate that fine-tuning suffers from the instability problem, i.e., tuning the same model under the same setting results in significantly different performance. Many recent works have proposed different methods to solve this problem, but there is no theoretical understanding of why and how these methods work. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical stability analysis of fine-tuning that focuses on two commonly used settings, namely, full fine-tuning and head tuning. We define the stability under each setting and prove the corresponding stability bounds. The theoretical bounds explain why and how several existing methods can stabilize the fine-tuning procedure. In addition to being able to explain most of the observed empirical discoveries, our proposed theoretical analysis framework can also help in the design of effective and provable methods. Based on our theory, we propose three novel strategies to stabilize the fine-tuning procedure, namely, Maximal Margin Regularizer (MMR), Multi-Head Loss (MHLoss), and Self Unsupervised Re-Training (SURT). We extensively evaluate our proposed approaches on 11 widely used real-world benchmark datasets, as well as hundreds of synthetic classification datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed methods significantly stabilize the fine-tuning procedure and also corroborate our theoretical analysis. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, transformer-based methods have made impressive progress in single-image super-resolu-tion (SR). However, these methods are difficult to apply to lightweight SR (LSR) due to the challenge of balancing model performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient striped window transformer (ESWT). ESWT consists of efficient transformation layers (ETLs), allowing a clean structure and avoiding redundant operations. Moreover, we designed a striped window mechanism to obtain a more efficient ESWT in modeling long-term dependencies. To further exploit the potential of the transformer, we propose a novel flexible window training strategy. Without any additional cost, this strategy can further improve the performance of ESWT. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based LSR methods with fewer parameters, faster inference, smaller FLOPs, and less memory consumption, achieving a better trade-off between model performance and complexity. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new approach which uses the tools within Artificial Intelligence (AI) software libraries as an alternative way of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that have been discretised using standard numerical methods. In particular, we describe how to represent numerical discretisations arising from the finite volume and finite element methods by pre-determining the weights of convolutional layers within a neural network. As the weights are defined by the discretisation scheme, no training of the network is required and the solutions obtained are identical (accounting for solver tolerances) to those obtained with standard codes often written in Fortran or C++. We also explain how to implement the Jacobi method and a multigrid solver using the functions available in AI libraries. For the latter, we use a U-Net architecture which is able to represent a sawtooth multigrid method. A benefit of using AI libraries in this way is that one can exploit their power and their built-in technologies. For example, their executions are already optimised for different computer architectures, whether it be CPUs, GPUs or new-generation AI processors. In this article, we apply the proposed approach to eigenvalue problems in reactor physics where neutron transport is described by diffusion theory. For a fuel assembly benchmark, we demonstrate that the solution obtained from our new approach is the same (accounting for solver tolerances) as that obtained from the same discretisation coded in a standard way using Fortran. We then proceed to solve a reactor core benchmark using the new approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent years have witnessed the tremendous success of diffusion models in data synthesis. However, when diffusion models are applied to sensitive data, they also give rise to severe privacy concerns. In this paper, we systematically present the first study about membership inference attacks against diffusion models, which aims to infer whether a sample was used to train the model. Two attack methods are proposed, namely loss-based and likelihood-based attacks. Our attack methods are evaluated on several state-of-the-art diffusion models, over different datasets in relation to privacy-sensitive data. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our attacks can achieve remarkable performance. Furthermore, we exhaustively investigate various factors which can affect attack performance. Finally, we also evaluate the performance of our attack methods on diffusion models trained with differential privacy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper we solve the Boltzmann transport equation using AI libraries. The reason why this is attractive is because it enables one to use the highly optimised software within AI libraries, enabling one to run on different computer architectures and enables one to tap into the vast quantity of community based software that has been developed for AI and ML applications e.g. mixed arithmetic precision or model parallelism. Here we take the first steps towards developing this approach for the Boltzmann transport equation and develop the necessary methods in order to do that effectively. This includes: 1) A space-angle multigrid solution method that can extract the level of parallelism necessary to run efficiently on GPUs or new AI computers. 2) A new Convolutional Finite Element Method (ConvFEM) that greatly simplifies the implementation of high order finite elements (quadratic to quintic, say). 3) A new non-linear Petrov-Galerkin method that introduces dissipation anisotropically. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fallacies are used as seemingly valid arguments to support a position and persuade the audience about its validity. Recognizing fallacies is an intrinsically difficult task both for humans and machines. Moreover, a big challenge for computational models lies in the fact that fallacies are formulated differently across the datasets with differences in the input format (e.g., question-answer pair, sentence with fallacy fragment), genre (e.g., social media, dialogue, news), as well as types and number of fallacies (from 5 to 18 types per dataset). To move towards solving the fallacy recognition task, we approach these differences across datasets as multiple tasks and show how instruction-based prompting in a multitask setup based on the T5 model improves the results against approaches built for a specific dataset such as T5, BERT or GPT-3. We show the ability of this multitask prompting approach to recognize 28 unique fallacies across domains and genres and study the effect of model size and prompt choice by analyzing the per-class (i.e., fallacy type) results. Finally, we analyze the effect of annotation quality on model performance, and the feasibility of complementing this approach with external knowledge. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Objective: Assess the feasibility of using ChatGPT or a similar AI-based chatbot for patient-provider communication. Participants: A US representative sample of 430 study participants aged 18 and above. 53.2% of respondents analyzed were women; their average age was 47.1. Exposure: Ten representative non-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted from the EHR. Patients' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to respond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's response. In the survey, each patient's question was followed by a provider- or ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five responses were provider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants were asked, and incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response source. Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots' functions in patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Results: The correct classification of responses ranged between 49.0% to 85.7% for different questions. On average, chatbot responses were correctly identified 65.5% of the time, and provider responses were correctly distinguished 65.1% of the time. On average, responses toward patients' trust in chatbots' functions were weakly positive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower trust as the health-related complexity of the task in questions increased. Conclusions: ChatGPT responses to patient questions were weakly distinguishable from provider responses. Laypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer lower risk health questions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Speech-driven gesture synthesis is a field of growing interest in virtual human creation. However, a critical challenge is the inherent intricate one-to-many mapping between speech and gestures. Previous studies have explored and achieved significant progress with generative models. Notwithstanding, most synthetic gestures are still vastly less natural. This paper presents DiffMotion, a novel speech-driven gesture synthesis architecture based on diffusion models. The model comprises an autoregressive temporal encoder and a denoising diffusion probability Module. The encoder extracts the temporal context of the speech input and historical gestures. The diffusion module learns a parameterized Markov chain to gradually convert a simple distribution into a complex distribution and generates the gestures according to the accompanied speech. Compared with baselines, objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our approach can produce natural and diverse gesticulation and demonstrate the benefits of diffusion-based models on speech-driven gesture synthesis. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers have been widely used for video processing owing to the multi-head self attention (MHSA) mechanism. However, the MHSA mechanism encounters an intrinsic difficulty for video inpainting, since the features associated with the corrupted regions are degraded and incur inaccurate self attention. This problem, termed query degradation, may be mitigated by first completing optical flows and then using the flows to guide the self attention, which was verified in our previous work - flow-guided transformer (FGT). We further exploit the flow guidance and propose FGT++ to pursue more effective and efficient video inpainting. First, we design a lightweight flow completion network by using local aggregation and edge loss. Second, to address the query degradation, we propose a flow guidance feature integration module, which uses the motion discrepancy to enhance the features, together with a flow-guided feature propagation module that warps the features according to the flows. Third, we decouple the transformer along the temporal and spatial dimensions, where flows are used to select the tokens through a temporally deformable MHSA mechanism, and global tokens are combined with the inner-window local tokens through a dual perspective MHSA mechanism. FGT++ is experimentally evaluated to be outperforming the existing video inpainting networks qualitatively and quantitatively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is taking on increasingly autonomous roles, e.g., browsing the web as a research assistant and managing money. But specifying goals and restrictions for AI behavior is difficult. Similar to how parties to a legal contract cannot foresee every potential "if-then" contingency of their future relationship, we cannot specify desired AI behavior for all circumstances. Legal standards facilitate the robust communication of inherently vague and underspecified goals. Instructions (in the case of language models, "prompts") that employ legal standards will allow AI agents to develop shared understandings of the spirit of a directive that can adapt to novel situations, and generalize expectations regarding acceptable actions to take in unspecified states of the world. Standards have built-in context that is lacking from other goal specification languages, such as plain language and programming languages. Through an empirical study on thousands of evaluation labels we constructed from U.S. court opinions, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) are beginning to exhibit an "understanding" of one of the most relevant legal standards for AI agents: fiduciary obligations. Performance comparisons across models suggest that, as LLMs continue to exhibit improved core capabilities, their legal standards understanding will also continue to improve. OpenAI's latest LLM has 78% accuracy on our data, their previous release has 73% accuracy, and a model from their 2020 GPT-3 paper has 27% accuracy (worse than random). Our research is an initial step toward a framework for evaluating AI understanding of legal standards more broadly, and for conducting reinforcement learning with legal feedback (RLLF). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The generation of natural human motion interactions is a hot topic in computer vision and computer animation. It is a challenging task due to the diversity of possible human motion interactions. Diffusion models, which have already shown remarkable generative capabilities in other domains, are a good candidate for this task. In this paper, we introduce a novel bipartite graph diffusion method (BiGraphDiff) to generate human motion interactions between two persons. Specifically, bipartite node sets are constructed to model the inherent geometric constraints between skeleton nodes during interactions. The interaction graph diffusion model is transformer-based, combining some state-of-the-art motion methods. We show that the proposed achieves new state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for the human interaction generation task. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The explosive popularity of diffusion models[ 1][ 2][ 3 ] has provided a huge stage for further development in generative-text modelling. As prompt based models are very nuanced, such that a carefully generated prompt can produce truely breath taking images, on the contrary producing powerful or even meaningful prompt is a hit or a miss. To lavish on this we have introduced a large scale derived and synthesized dataset built with on real prompts and indexed with popular image-text datasets like MS-COCO[4 ], Flickr[ 5], etc. We have also introduced staging for these sentences that sequentially reduce the context and increase the complexity, that will further strengthen the output because of the complex annotations that are being created. MTTN consists of over 2.4M sentences that are divided over 5 stages creating a combination amounting to over 12M pairs, along with a vocab size of consisting more than 300 thousands unique words that creates an abundance of variations. The original 2.4M million pairs are broken down in such a manner that it produces a true scenario of internet lingo that is used globally thereby heightening the robustness of the dataset, and any model trained on it. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper presents a novel machine learning framework for detecting Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PxAF), a pathological characteristic of Electrocardiogram (ECG) that can lead to fatal conditions such as heart attack. To enhance the learning process, the framework involves a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) along with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in the data preparation and classifier optimization phases. The GAN is innovatively invoked to overcome the class imbalance of the training data by producing the synthetic ECG for PxAF class in a certified manner. The effect of the certified GAN is statistically validated. Instead of using a general-purpose classifier, the NAS automatically designs a highly accurate convolutional neural network architecture customized for the PxAF classification task. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed framework exhibits a high value of 99% which not only enhances state-of-the-art by up to 5.1%, but also improves the classification performance of the two widely-accepted baseline methods, ResNet-18, and Auto-Sklearn, by 2.2% and 6.1%. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of whitelist tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of whitelist tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Computer-aided detection systems based on deep learning have shown great potential in breast cancer detection. However, the lack of domain generalization of artificial neural networks is an important obstacle to their deployment in changing clinical environments. In this work, we explore the domain generalization of deep learning methods for mass detection in digital mammography and analyze in-depth the sources of domain shift in a large-scale multi-center setting. To this end, we compare the performance of eight state-of-the-art detection methods, including Transformer-based models, trained in a single domain and tested in five unseen domains. Moreover, a single-source mass detection training pipeline is designed to improve the domain generalization without requiring images from the new domain. The results show that our workflow generalizes better than state-of-the-art transfer learning-based approaches in four out of five domains while reducing the domain shift caused by the different acquisition protocols and scanner manufacturers. Subsequently, an extensive analysis is performed to identify the covariate shifts with bigger effects on the detection performance, such as due to differences in patient age, breast density, mass size, and mass malignancy. Ultimately, this comprehensive study provides key insights and best practices for future research on domain generalization in deep learning-based breast cancer detection. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Have you ever been troubled by the complexity and computational cost of SE(3) protein structure modeling and been amazed by the simplicity and power of language modeling? Recent work has shown promise in simplifying protein structures as sequences of protein angles; therefore, language models could be used for unconstrained protein backbone generation. Unfortunately, such simplification is unsuitable for the constrained protein inpainting problem, where the model needs to recover masked structures conditioned on unmasked ones, as it dramatically increases the computing cost of geometric constraints. To overcome this dilemma, we suggest inserting a hidden \textbf{a}tomic \textbf{d}irection \textbf{s}pace (\textbf{ADS}) upon the language model, converting invariant backbone angles into equivalent direction vectors and preserving the simplicity, called Seq2Direct encoder ($\text{Enc}_{s2d}$). Geometric constraints could be efficiently imposed on the newly introduced direction space. A Direct2Seq decoder ($\text{Dec}_{d2s}$) with mathematical guarantees is also introduced to develop a \textbf{SDS} ($\text{Enc}_{s2d}$+$\text{Dec}_{d2s}$) model. We apply the SDS model as the denoising neural network during the conditional diffusion process, resulting in a constrained generative model--\textbf{DiffSDS}. Extensive experiments show that the plug-and-play ADS could transform the language model into a strong structural model without loss of simplicity. More importantly, the proposed DiffSDS outperforms previous strong baselines by a large margin on the task of protein inpainting. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (re-ID) aims to learn identity information from labeled images in source domains and apply it to unlabeled images in a target domain. One major issue with many unsupervised re-identification methods is that they do not perform well relative to large domain variations such as illumination, viewpoint, and occlusions. In this paper, we propose a Synthesis Model Bank (SMB) to deal with illumination variation in unsupervised person re-ID. The proposed SMB consists of several convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Mahalanobis matrices for distance metrics. They are trained using synthetic data with different illumination conditions such that their synergistic effect makes the SMB robust against illumination variation. To better quantify the illumination intensity and improve the quality of synthetic images, we introduce a new 3D virtual-human dataset for GAN-based image synthesis. From our experiments, the proposed SMB outperforms other synthesis methods on several re-ID benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Histopathology image synthesis aims to address the data shortage issue in training deep learning approaches for accurate cancer detection. However, existing methods struggle to produce realistic images that have accurate nuclei boundaries and less artifacts, which limits the application in downstream tasks. To address the challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances the quality of synthetic images by using nuclei topology and contour regularization. The proposed approach uses the skeleton map of nuclei to integrate nuclei topology and separate touching nuclei. In the loss function, we propose two new contour regularization terms that enhance the contrast between contour and non-contour pixels and increase the similarity between contour pixels. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets using image quality metrics and a downstream task (nuclei segmentation). The proposed approach outperforms Sharp-GAN in all four image quality metrics on two datasets. By integrating 6k synthetic images from the proposed approach into training, a nuclei segmentation model achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation performance on TNBC dataset and its detection quality (DQ), segmentation quality (SQ), panoptic quality (PQ), and aggregated Jaccard index (AJI) is 0.855, 0.863, 0.691, and 0.683, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Multiple data sets are used as an inspiration to simulate sketches of different cellular structures, allowing to generate fully-annotated image data sets without requiring human interactions. Those data sets are used to train segmentation approaches and demonstrate that annotation-free segmentation of cellular structures in fluorescence microscopy image data can be achieved, thereby leaping towards the ultimate goal of eliminating the necessity of human annotation efforts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
