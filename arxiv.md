        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2023 Task 10, whose goal is the detection of sexism in social media. We explore some of the most popular transformer models such as BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We also study different data augmentation techniques to increase the training dataset. During the development phase, our best results were obtained by using RoBERTa and data augmentation for tasks B and C. However, the use of synthetic data does not improve the results for task C. We participated in the three subtasks. Our approach still has much room for improvement, especially in the two fine-grained classifications.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we introduce a denoising diffusion algorithm to discover microstructures with nonlinear fine-tuned properties. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are generative models that use diffusion-based dynamics to gradually denoise images and generate realistic synthetic samples. By learning the reverse of a Markov diffusion process, we design an artificial intelligence to efficiently manipulate the topology of microstructures to generate a massive number of prototypes that exhibit constitutive responses sufficiently close to designated nonlinear constitutive responses. To identify the subset of microstructures with sufficiently precise fine-tuned properties, a convolutional neural network surrogate is trained to replace high-fidelity finite element simulations to filter out prototypes outside the admissible range. The results of this study indicate that the denoising diffusion process is capable of creating microstructures of fine-tuned nonlinear material properties within the latent space of the training data. More importantly, the resulting algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate additional topological and geometric modifications by introducing high-dimensional structures embedded in the latent space. The algorithm is tested on the open-source mechanical MNIST data set. Consequently, this algorithm is not only capable of performing inverse design of nonlinear effective media but also learns the nonlinear structure-property map to quantitatively understand the multiscale interplay among the geometry and topology and their effective macroscopic properties. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The issue of missing data poses a great challenge on boosting performance and application of deep learning models in the {\em Knowledge Tracing} (KT) problem. However, there has been the lack of understanding on the issue in the literature. %are not sufficient studies tackling this problem. In this work, to address this challenge, we adopt a subject-based training method to split and impute data by student IDs instead of row number splitting which we call non-subject based training. The benefit of subject-based training can retain the complete sequence for each student and hence achieve efficient training. Further, we leverage two existing deep generative frameworks, namely variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Longitudinal Variational Autoencoders (LVAE) frameworks and build LSTM kernels into them to form LSTM-VAE and LSTM LVAE (noted as VAE and LVAE for simplicity) models to generate quality data. In LVAE, a Gaussian Process (GP) model is trained to disentangle the correlation between the subject (i.e., student) descriptor information (e.g., age, gender) and the latent space. The paper finally compare the model performance between training the original data and training the data imputed with generated data from non-subject based model VAE-NS and subject-based training models (i.e., VAE and LVAE). We demonstrate that the generated data from LSTM-VAE and LSTM-LVAE can boost the original model performance by about 50%. Moreover, the original model just needs 10% more student data to surpass the original performance if the prediction model is small and 50\% more data if the prediction model is large with our proposed frameworks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Our work focuses on anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems. Prior literature has three limitations: (1) Failing to capture long-delayed patterns in system anomalies; (2) Ignoring dynamic changes in sensor connections; (3) The curse of high-dimensional data samples. These limit the detection performance and usefulness of existing works. To address them, we propose a new approach called deep graph stream support vector data description (SVDD) for anomaly detection. Specifically, we first use a transformer to preserve both short and long temporal patterns of monitoring data in temporal embeddings. Then we cluster these embeddings according to sensor type and utilize them to estimate the change in connectivity between various sensors to construct a new weighted graph. The temporal embeddings are mapped to the new graph as node attributes to form weighted attributed graph. We input the graph into a variational graph auto-encoder model to learn final spatio-temporal representation. Finally, we learn a hypersphere that encompasses normal embeddings and predict the system status by calculating the distances between the hypersphere and data samples. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our model, which improves F1-score by 35.87%, AUC by 19.32%, while being 32 times faster than the best baseline at training and inference. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We formalize a novel interpretation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) as giving rise to a Poisson Point Process (PPP). This PPP interpretation allows for rigorous quantification of uncertainty in NeRFs, in particular, for computing collision probabilities for a robot navigating through a NeRF environment model. The PPP is a generalization of a probabilistic occupancy grid to the continuous volume and is fundamental to the volumetric ray-tracing model underlying radiance fields. Building upon this PPP model, we present a chance-constrained trajectory optimization method for safe robot navigation in NeRFs. Our method relies on a voxel representation called the Probabilistic Unsafe Robot Region (PURR) that spatially fuses the chance constraint with the NeRF model to facilitate fast trajectory optimization. We then combine a graph-based search with a spline-based trajectory optimization to yield robot trajectories through the NeRF that are guaranteed to satisfy a user-specific collision probability. We validate our chance constrained planning method through simulations, showing superior performance compared with two other methods for trajectory planning in NeRF environment models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Machine learning is not readily accessible to domain experts from many fields, blocked by issues ranging from data mining to model training. We argue that domain experts should be at the center of the modeling process, and we introduce the "Agile Modeling" problem: the process of turning any visual concept from an idea into a well-trained ML classifier through a human-in-the-loop interaction driven by the domain expert in a way that minimizes domain expert time. We propose a solution to the problem that enables domain experts to create classifiers in real-time and build upon recent advances in image-text co-embeddings such as CLIP or ALIGN to implement it. We show the feasibility of this solution through live experiments with 14 domain experts, each modeling their own concept. Finally, we compare a domain expert driven process with the traditional crowdsourcing paradigm and find that difficult concepts see pronounced improvements with domain experts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Machine Learning (ML) has become the new contrivance in almost every field. This makes them a target of fraudsters by various adversary attacks, thereby hindering the performance of ML models. Evasion and Data-Poison-based attacks are well acclaimed, especially in finance, healthcare, etc. This motivated us to propose a novel computationally less expensive attack mechanism based on the adversarial sample generation by Variational Auto Encoder (VAE). It is well known that Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) is considered computationally efficient in solving image and audio processing, speech recognition, and time-series forecasting. This paper proposed VAE-Deep-Wavelet Neural Network (VAE-Deep-WNN), where Encoder and Decoder employ WNN networks. Further, we proposed chaotic variants of both VAE with Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Deep-WNN and named them C-VAE-MLP and C-VAE-Deep-WNN, respectively. Here, we employed a Logistic map to generate random noise in the latent space. In this paper, we performed VAE-based adversary sample generation and applied it to various problems related to finance and cybersecurity domain-related problems such as loan default, credit card fraud, and churn modelling, etc., We performed both Evasion and Data-Poison attacks on Logistic Regression (LR) and Decision Tree (DT) models. The results indicated that VAE-Deep-WNN outperformed the rest in the majority of the datasets and models. However, its chaotic variant C-VAE-Deep-WNN performed almost similarly to VAE-Deep-WNN in the majority of the datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reconstructing perceived natural images or decoding their categories from fMRI signals are challenging tasks with great scientific significance. Due to the lack of paired samples, most existing methods fail to generate semantically recognizable reconstruction and are difficult to generalize to novel classes. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a task-agnostic brain decoding model by unifying the visual stimulus classification and reconstruction tasks in a semantic space. We denote it as BrainCLIP, which leverages CLIP's cross-modal generalization ability to bridge the modality gap between brain activities, images, and texts. Specifically, BrainCLIP is a VAE-based architecture that transforms fMRI patterns into the CLIP embedding space by combining visual and textual supervision. Note that previous works rarely use multi-modal supervision for visual stimulus decoding. Our experiments demonstrate that textual supervision can significantly boost the performance of decoding models compared to the condition where only image supervision exists. BrainCLIP can be applied to multiple scenarios like fMRI-to-image generation, fMRI-image-matching, and fMRI-text-matching. Compared with BraVL, a recently proposed multi-modal method for fMRI-based brain decoding, BrainCLIP achieves significantly better performance on the novel class classification task. BrainCLIP also establishes a new state-of-the-art for fMRI-based natural image reconstruction in terms of high-level image features. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Traffic forecasting is one of the most fundamental problems in transportation science and artificial intelligence. The key challenge is to effectively model complex spatial-temporal dependencies and correlations in modern traffic data. Existing methods, however, cannot accurately model both long-term and short-term temporal correlations simultaneously, limiting their expressive power on complex spatial-temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal neural network framework: Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (ASTGCRN), which consists of a graph convolutional recurrent module (GCRN) and a global attention module. In particular, GCRN integrates gated recurrent units and adaptive graph convolutional networks for dynamically learning graph structures and capturing spatial dependencies and local temporal relationships. To effectively extract global temporal dependencies, we design a temporal attention layer and implement it as three independent modules based on multi-head self-attention, transformer, and informer respectively. Extensive experiments on five real traffic datasets have demonstrated the excellent predictive performance of all our three models with all their average MAE, RMSE and MAPE across the test datasets lower than the baseline methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we present DA-BEV, an implicit depth learning method for Transformer-based camera-only 3D object detection in bird's eye view (BEV). First, a Depth-Aware Spatial Cross-Attention (DA-SCA) module is proposed to take depth into consideration when querying image features to construct BEV features. Then, to make the BEV feature more depth-aware, we introduce an auxiliary learning task, called Depth-wise Contrastive Learning (DCL), by sampling positive and negative BEV features along each ray that connects an object and a camera. DA-SCA and DCL jointly improve the BEV representation and make it more depth-aware. We show that DA-BEV obtains significant improvement (+2.8 NDS) on nuScenes val under the same setting when compared with the baseline method BEVFormer. DA-BEV also achieves strong results of 60.0 NDS and 51.5mAP on nuScenes test with pre-trained VoVNet-99 as backbone. We will release our code. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image forgery localization aims to identify forged regions by capturing subtle traces from high-quality discriminative features. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style network with two feature extraction branches for image forgery localization, and it is named as Two-Branch Transformer (TBFormer). Firstly, two feature extraction branches are elaborately designed, taking advantage of the discriminative stacked Transformer layers, for both RGB and noise domain features. Secondly, an Attention-aware Hierarchical-feature Fusion Module (AHFM) is proposed to effectively fuse hierarchical features from two different domains. Although the two feature extraction branches have the same architecture, their features have significant differences since they are extracted from different domains. We adopt position attention to embed them into a unified feature domain for hierarchical feature investigation. Finally, a Transformer decoder is constructed for feature reconstruction to generate the predicted mask. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text data augmentation is an effective strategy for overcoming the challenge of limited sample sizes in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation on the training data to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can not ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can not ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking completeness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named ChatAug). ChatGPT is trained on data with unparalleled linguistic richness and employs a reinforcement training process with large-scale human feedback, which endows the model with affinity to the naturalness of human language. Our text data augmentation approach ChatAug rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream model training. Experiment results on few-shot learning text classification tasks show the superior performance of the proposed ChatAug approach over state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of the augmented samples. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

We first describe the different modules of our system, including prompting to generate schematic elements, manual edit of those elements, and conversion of those into a schema graph. By qualitatively comparing our system to previous ones, we show that our system not only transfers to new domains more easily than previous approaches, but also reduces efforts of human curation thanks to our interactive interface. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recognizing human actions from untrimmed videos is an important task in activity understanding, and poses unique challenges in modeling long-range temporal relations. Recent works adopt a predict-and-refine strategy which converts an initial prediction to action segments for global context modeling. However, the generated segment representations are often noisy and exhibit inaccurate segment boundaries, over-segmentation and other problems. To deal with these issues, we propose an attention based approach which we call \textit{temporal segment transformer}, for joint segment relation modeling and denoising. The main idea is to denoise segment representations using attention between segment and frame representations, and also use inter-segment attention to capture temporal correlations between segments. The refined segment representations are used to predict action labels and adjust segment boundaries, and a final action segmentation is produced based on voting from segment masks. We show that this novel architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the popular 50Salads, GTEA and Breakfast benchmarks. We also conduct extensive ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of different components of our design. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Due to an increased application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) devices like drones, segmentation of aerial images for urban scene understanding has brought a new research opportunity. Aerial images own so much variability in scale, object appearance, and complex background. The task of semantic segmentation when capturing the underlying features in a global and local context for the UAV images becomes challenging. In this work, we proposed a UAV Segmentation Network (UAVSNet) for precise semantic segmentation of urban aerial scenes. It is a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework that uses multi-scale feature representations. The UAVSNet exploits the advantage of a self-attention-based transformer framework and convolution mechanisms in capturing the global and local context details. This helps the network precisely capture the inherent feature of the aerial images and generate overall semantically rich feature representation. The proposed Overlap Token Embedding (OTE) module generates multi-scale features. A decoder network is proposed, which further processes these features using a multi-scale feature fusion policy to enhance the feature representation ability of the network. We show the effectiveness of the proposed network on UAVid and Urban drone datasets by achieving mIoU of 64.35% and 74.64%, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Query encoding (QE) is proposed as a fast and robust solution to CQA. In the encoding process, most existing QE methods first parse the logical query into an executable computational direct-acyclic graph (DAG), then use neural networks to parameterize the operators, and finally, recursively execute these neuralized operators. However, the parameterization-and-execution paradigm may be potentially over-complicated, as it can be structurally simplified by a single neural network encoder. Meanwhile, sequence encoders, like LSTM and Transformer, proved to be effective for encoding semantic graphs in related tasks. Motivated by this, we propose sequential query encoding (SQE) as an alternative to encode queries for CQA. Instead of parameterizing and executing the computational graph, SQE first uses a search-based algorithm to linearize the computational graph to a sequence of tokens and then uses a sequence encoder to compute its vector representation. Then this vector representation is used as a query embedding to retrieve answers from the embedding space according to similarity scores. Despite its simplicity, SQE demonstrates state-of-the-art neural query encoding performance on FB15k, FB15k-237, and NELL on an extended benchmark including twenty-nine types of in-distribution queries. Further experiment shows that SQE also demonstrates comparable knowledge inference capability on out-of-distribution queries, whose query types are not observed during the training process. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pretrained language models (PLMs), such as GPT2, have achieved remarkable empirical performance in text generation tasks. However, pretrained on large-scale natural language corpora, the generated text from PLMs may exhibit social bias against disadvantaged demographic groups. To improve the fairness of PLMs in text generation, we propose to minimize the mutual information between the semantics in the generated text sentences and their demographic polarity, i.e., the demographic group to which the sentence is referring. In this way, the mentioning of a demographic group (e.g., male or female) is encouraged to be independent from how it is described in the generated text, thus effectively alleviating the social bias. Moreover, we propose to efficiently estimate the upper bound of the above mutual information via importance sampling, leveraging a natural language corpus. We also propose a distillation mechanism that preserves the language modeling ability of the PLMs after debiasing. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior performance in term of both fairness and language modeling ability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deployment of reinforcement learning algorithms for robotics applications in the real world requires ensuring the safety of the robot and its environment. Safe robot reinforcement learning (SRRL) is a crucial step towards achieving human-robot coexistence. In this paper, we envision a human-centered SRRL framework consisting of three stages: safe exploration, safety value alignment, and safe collaboration. We examine the research gaps in these areas and propose to leverage interactive behaviors for SRRL. Interactive behaviors enable bi-directional information transfer between humans and robots, such as conversational robot ChatGPT. We argue that interactive behaviors need further attention from the SRRL community. We discuss four open challenges related to the robustness, efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of SRRL with interactive behaviors. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-guided diffusion models such as DALLE-2, IMAGEN, and Stable Diffusion are able to generate an effectively endless variety of images given only a short text prompt describing the desired image content. In many cases the images are very high quality as well. However, these models often struggle to compose scenes containing several key objects such as characters in specified positional relationships. Unfortunately, this capability to ``direct'' the placement of characters and objects both within and across images is crucial in storytelling, as recognized in the literature on film and animation theory. In this work we take a particularly straightforward approach to providing the needed direction, by injecting ``activation'' at desired positions in the cross-attention maps corresponding to the objects under control, while attenuating the remainder of the map. The resulting approach is a step toward generalizing the applicability of text-guided diffusion models beyond single images to collections of related images, as in storybooks. To the best of our knowledge, our Directed Diffusion method is the first diffusion technique that provides positional control over multiple objects, while making use of an existing pre-trained model and maintaining a coherent blend between the positioned objects and the background. Moreover, it requires only a few lines to implement. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In modern machine learning, inner product attention computation is a fundamental task for training large language models such as Transformer, GPT-1, BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Formally, in this problem, one is given as input three matrices $Q, K, V \in [-B,B]^{n \times d}$, and the goal is to construct the matrix $\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V) := \mathrm{diag}(A {\bf 1}_n)^{-1} A V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $A = \exp(QK^\top/d)$ is the `attention matrix', and $\exp$ is applied entry-wise. Straightforward methods for this problem explicitly compute the $n \times n$ attention matrix $A$, and hence require time $\Omega(n^2)$ even when $d = n^{o(1)}$ is small. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advancements toward perception and decision-making of flexible endoscopes have shown great potential in computer-aided surgical interventions. However, owing to modeling uncertainty and inter-patient anatomical variation in flexible endoscopy, the challenge remains for efficient and safe navigation in patient-specific scenarios. This paper presents a novel data-driven framework with self-contained visual-shape fusion for autonomous intelligent navigation of flexible endoscopes requiring no priori knowledge of system models and global environments. A learning-based adaptive visual servoing controller is proposed to online update the eye-in-hand vision-motor configuration and steer the endoscope, which is guided by monocular depth estimation via a vision transformer (ViT). To prevent unnecessary and excessive interactions with surrounding anatomy, an energy-motivated shape planning algorithm is introduced through entire endoscope 3-D proprioception from embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Furthermore, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is developed to minimize the elastic potential energy flow and simultaneously optimize the steering policy. Dedicated navigation experiments on a robotic-assisted flexible endoscope with an FBG fiber in several phantom environments demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed framework. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent learning-based video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms are expensive to implement due to the cost of data collection of human quality opinions, and are less robust across various scenarios due to the biases of these opinions. This motivates our exploration on opinion-unaware (a.k.a zero-shot) VQA approaches. Existing approaches only considers low-level naturalness in spatial or temporal domain, without considering impacts from high-level semantics. In this work, we introduce an explicit semantic affinity index for opinion-unaware VQA using text-prompts in the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model. We also aggregate it with different traditional low-level naturalness indexes through gaussian normalization and sigmoid rescaling strategies. Composed of aggregated semantic and technical metrics, the proposed Blind Unified Opinion-Unaware Video Quality Index via Semantic and Technical Metric Aggregation (BUONA-VISTA) outperforms existing opinion-unaware VQA methods by at least 20% improvements, and is more robust than opinion-aware approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Packet loss concealment (PLC) is challenging in concealing missing contents both plausibly and naturally when there are only limited available context to use. Recently deep-learning based PLC algorithms have demonstrated their superiority over traditional counterparts; but their concealment ability is still mostly limited to a maximum of 120ms loss. Even with strong GAN-based generative models, it is still very challenging to predict long burst losses that could happen within/in-between phonemes. In this paper, we propose to use contrastive learning to learn a loss-robust semantic representation for PLC. A hybrid neural PLC architecture combining the semantic prediction and GAN-based generative model is designed to verify its effectiveness. Results on the blind test set of Interspeech2022 PLC Challenge show its superiority over commonly used UNet-style framework and the one without contrastive learning, especially for the longer burst loss at (120, 220] ms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the advantages of fast inference and human-friendly flexible manipulation, image-agnostic style manipulation via text guidance enables new applications that were not previously available. The state-of-the-art text-guided image-agnostic manipulation method embeds the representation of each channel of StyleGAN independently in the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) space, and provides it in the form of a Dictionary to quickly find out the channel-wise manipulation direction during inference time. However, in this paper we argue that this dictionary which is constructed by controlling single channel individually is limited to accommodate the versatility of text guidance since the collective and interactive relation among multiple channels are not considered. Indeed, we show that it fails to discover a large portion of manipulation directions that can be found by existing methods, which manually manipulates latent space without texts. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel method that learns a Dictionary, whose entry corresponds to the representation of a single channel, by taking into account the manipulation effect coming from the interaction with multiple other channels. We demonstrate that our strategy resolves the inability of previous methods in finding diverse known directions from unsupervised methods and unknown directions from random text while maintaining the real-time inference speed and disentanglement ability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Imitation learning addresses the challenge of learning by observing an expert's demonstrations without access to reward signals from the environment. Behavioral cloning (BC) formulates imitation learning as a supervised learning problem and learns from sampled state-action pairs. Despite its simplicity, it often fails to capture the temporal structure of the task and the global information of expert demonstrations. This work aims to augment BC by employing diffusion models for modeling expert behaviors, and designing a learning objective that leverages learned diffusion models to guide policy learning. To this end, we propose diffusion model-augmented behavioral cloning (Diffusion-BC) that combines our proposed diffusion model guided learning objective with the BC objective, which complements each other. Our proposed method outperforms baselines or achieves competitive performance in various continuous control domains, including navigation, robot arm manipulation, and locomotion. Ablation studies justify our design choices and investigate the effect of balancing the BC and our proposed diffusion model objective. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Punctuation restoration plays an essential role in the post-processing procedure of automatic speech recognition, but model efficiency is a key requirement for this task. To that end, we present EfficientPunct, an ensemble method with a multimodal time-delay neural network that outperforms the current best model by 1.0 F1 points, using less than a tenth of its parameters to process embeddings. We streamline a speech recognizer to efficiently output hidden layer latent vectors as audio embeddings for punctuation restoration, as well as BERT to extract meaningful text embeddings. By using forced alignment and temporal convolutions, we eliminate the need for multi-head attention-based fusion, greatly increasing computational efficiency but also raising performance. EfficientPunct sets a new state of the art, in terms of both performance and efficiency, with an ensemble that weights BERT's purely language-based predictions slightly more than the multimodal network's predictions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Recently, large language models like GPT-3 have made it possible to generate significantly longer natural-sounding suggestions, offering more advanced assistance opportunities. This study explores the trade-offs between sentence- vs. message-level suggestions for AI-mediated communication. We recruited 120 participants to act as staffers from legislators' offices who often need to respond to large volumes of constituent concerns. Participants were asked to reply to emails with different types of assistance. The results show that participants receiving message-level suggestions responded faster and were more satisfied with the experience, as they mainly edited the suggested drafts. In addition, the texts they wrote were evaluated as more helpful by others. In comparison, participants receiving sentence-level assistance retained a higher sense of agency, but took longer for the task as they needed to plan the flow of their responses and decide when to use suggestions. Our findings have implications for designing task-appropriate communication assistance systems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted a lot of attention in scientific computing as their functional representation of partial differential equation (PDE) solutions offers flexibility and accuracy features. However, their training cost has limited their practical use as a real alternative to classic numerical methods. Thus, we propose to incorporate multi-resolution hash encoding into PINNs to improve the training efficiency, as such encoding offers a locally-aware (at multi resolution) coordinate inputs to the neural network. Borrowed from the neural representation field community (NeRF), we investigate the robustness of calculating the derivatives of such hash encoded neural networks with respect to the input coordinates, which is often needed by the PINN loss terms. We propose to replace the automatic differentiation with finite-difference calculations of the derivatives to address the discontinuous nature of such derivatives. We also share the appropriate ranges for the hash encoding hyperparameters to obtain robust derivatives. We test the proposed method on three problems, including Burgers equation, Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed method admits about a 10-fold improvement in efficiency over the vanilla PINN implementation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, skeleton-based human action has become a hot research topic because the compact representation of human skeletons brings new blood to this research domain. As a result, researchers began to notice the importance of using RGB or other sensors to analyze human action by extracting skeleton information. Leveraging the rapid development of deep learning (DL), a significant number of skeleton-based human action approaches have been presented with fine-designed DL structures recently. However, a well-trained DL model always demands high-quality and sufficient data, which is hard to obtain without costing high expenses and human labor. In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation method for skeleton-based action recognition tasks, which can effectively generate high-quality and diverse sequential actions. In order to obtain natural and realistic action sequences, we propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) that can generate a series of synthetic action sequences, and their generation process is precisely guided by a spatial-temporal transformer (ST-Trans). Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) motion generation approaches on different naturality and diversity metrics. It proves that its high-quality synthetic data can also be effectively deployed to existing action recognition models with significant performance improvement. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite increasingly fluent, relevant, and coherent language generation, major gaps remain between how humans and machines use language. We argue that a key dimension that is missing from our understanding of language models (LMs) is the model's ability to interpret and generate expressions of uncertainty. Whether it be the weatherperson announcing a chance of rain or a doctor giving a diagnosis, information is often not black-and-white and expressions of uncertainty provide nuance to support human-decision making. The increasing deployment of LMs in the wild motivates us to investigate whether LMs are capable of interpreting expressions of uncertainty and how LMs' behaviors change when learning to emit their own expressions of uncertainty. When injecting expressions of uncertainty into prompts (e.g., "I think the answer is..."), we discover that GPT3's generations vary upwards of 80% in accuracy based on the expression used. We analyze the linguistic characteristics of these expressions and find a drop in accuracy when naturalistic expressions of certainty are present. We find similar effects when teaching models to emit their own expressions of uncertainty, where model calibration suffers when teaching models to emit certainty rather than uncertainty. Together, these results highlight the challenges of building LMs that interpret and generate trustworthy expressions of uncertainty. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The transformer is a widely-used building block in modern neural networks. However, when applied to audio data, the transformer's acausal behaviour, which we term Acausal Attention (AA), has generally limited its application to offline tasks. In this paper we introduce Streaming Attention (SA), which operates causally with fixed latency, and requires lower compute and memory resources than AA to train. Next, we introduce Low Latency Streaming Attention (LLSA), a method which combines multiple SA layers without latency build-up proportional to the layer count. Comparative analysis between AA, SA and LLSA on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) tasks are presented. The results show that causal SA-based networks with fixed latencies of a few seconds (e.g. 1.8 seconds) and LLSA networks with latencies as short as 300 ms can perform comparably with acausal (AA) networks. We conclude that SA and LLSA methods retain many of the benefits of conventional acausal transformers, but with latency characteristics that make them practical to run in real-time streaming applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for clustering multivariate time-series data. However, real-world time-series data often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we present a Self-supervised Learning-based Approach to Clustering multivariate Time-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the TRACK-TBI dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that SLAC-Time outperforms the baseline K-means clustering algorithm in terms of silhouette coefficient, Calinski Harabasz index, Dunn index, and Davies Bouldin index. We identified three TBI phenotypes that are distinct from one another in terms of clinically significant variables as well as clinical outcomes, including the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) score, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate. The experiments show that the TBI phenotypes identified by SLAC-Time can be potentially used for developing targeted clinical trials and therapeutic strategies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a new technique for computational language representation called elementwise embedding, in which a material (semantic unit) is abstracted into a horizontal concatenation of lower-dimensional element (character) embeddings. While elements are always characters, materials are arbitrary levels of semantic units so it generalizes to any type of tokenization. To focus only on the important letters, the $n^{th}$ spellings of each semantic unit are aligned in $n^{th}$ attention heads, then concatenated back into original forms creating unique embedding representations; they are jointly projected thereby determining own contextual importance. Technically, this framework is achieved by passing a sequence of materials, each consists of $v$ elements, to a transformer having $h=v$ attention heads. As a pure embedding technique, elementwise embedding replaces the $w$-dimensional embedding table of a transformer model with $256$ $c$-dimensional elements (each corresponding to one of UTF-8 bytes) where $c=w/v$. Using this novel approach, we show that the standard transformer architecture can be reused for all levels of language representations and be able to process much longer sequences at the same time-complexity without "any" architectural modification and additional overhead. BERT trained with elementwise embedding outperforms its subword equivalence (original implementation) in multilabel patent document classification exhibiting superior robustness to domain-specificity and data imbalance, despite using $0.005\%$ of embedding parameters. Experiments demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method by successfully transferring these enhancements to differently architected transformers CANINE and ALBERT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for privacy-preserving computation in recent years. Unfortunately, FL faces two critical challenges that hinder its actual performance: data distribution heterogeneity and high resource costs brought by large foundation models. Specifically, the non-IID data in different clients make existing FL algorithms hard to converge while the high resource costs, including computational and communication costs that increase the deployment difficulty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective yet simple method, named FedCLIP, to achieve fast generalization and personalization for CLIP in federated learning. Concretely, we design an attention-based adapter for the large model, CLIP, and the rest operations merely depend on adapters. Lightweight adapters can make the most use of pretrained model information and ensure models be adaptive for clients in specific tasks. Simultaneously, small-scale operations can mitigate the computational burden and communication burden caused by large models. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets with distribution shifts. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that FedCLIP significantly outperforms other baselines (9% overall improvements on PACS) and effectively reduces computational and communication costs (283x faster than FedAVG).

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reasoning the 3D structure of a non-rigid dynamic scene from a single moving camera is an under-constrained problem. Inspired by the remarkable progress of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in photo-realistic novel view synthesis of static scenes, extensions have been proposed for dynamic settings. These methods heavily rely on neural priors in order to regularize the problem. In this work, we take a step back and reinvestigate how current implementations may entail deleterious effects, including limited expressiveness, entanglement of light and density fields, and sub-optimal motion localization. As a remedy, we advocate for a bridge between classic non-rigid-structure-from-motion (\nrsfm) and NeRF, enabling the well-studied priors of the former to constrain the latter. To this end, we propose a framework that factorizes time and space by formulating a scene as a composition of bandlimited, high-dimensional signals. We demonstrate compelling results across complex dynamic scenes that involve changes in lighting, texture and long-range dynamics. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recently developed transformer networks have achieved impressive performance in image denoising by exploiting the self-attention (SA) in images. However, the existing methods mostly use a relatively small window to compute SA due to the quadratic complexity of it, which limits the model's ability to model long-term image information. In this paper, we propose the spatial-frequency attention network (SFANet) to enhance the network's ability in exploiting long-range dependency. For spatial attention module (SAM), we adopt dilated SA to model long-range dependency. In the frequency attention module (FAM), we exploit more global information by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) by designing a window-based frequency channel attention (WFCA) block to effectively model deep frequency features and their dependencies. To make our module applicable to images of different sizes and keep the model consistency between training and inference, we apply window-based FFT with a set of fixed window sizes. In addition, channel attention is computed on both real and imaginary parts of the Fourier spectrum, which further improves restoration performance. The proposed WFCA block can effectively model image long-range dependency with acceptable complexity. Experiments on multiple denoising benchmarks demonstrate the leading performance of SFANet network. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The lack of data and the difficulty of multimodal fusion have always been challenges for multimodal emotion recognition (MER). In this paper, we propose to use pretrained models as upstream network, wav2vec 2.0 for audio modality and BERT for text modality, and finetune them in downstream task of MER to cope with the lack of data. For the difficulty of multimodal fusion, we use a K-layer multi-head attention mechanism as a downstream fusion module. Starting from the MER task itself, we design two auxiliary tasks to alleviate the insufficient fusion between modalities and guide the network to capture and align emotion-related features. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art models, we achieve a better performance by 78.42% Weighted Accuracy (WA) and 79.71% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) on the IEMOCAP dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose to perform video question answering (VideoQA) in a Contrastive manner via a Video Graph Transformer model (CoVGT). CoVGT's uniqueness and superiority are three-fold: 1) It proposes a dynamic graph transformer module which encodes video by explicitly capturing the visual objects, their relations and dynamics, for complex spatio-temporal reasoning. 2) It designs separate video and text transformers for contrastive learning between the video and text to perform QA, instead of multi-modal transformer for answer classification. Fine-grained video-text communication is done by additional cross-modal interaction modules. 3) It is optimized by the joint fully- and self-supervised contrastive objectives between the correct and incorrect answers, as well as the relevant and irrelevant questions respectively. With superior video encoding and QA solution, we show that CoVGT can achieve much better performances than previous arts on video reasoning tasks. Its performances even surpass those models that are pretrained with millions of external data. We further show that CoVGT can also benefit from cross-modal pretraining, yet with orders of magnitude smaller data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CoVGT, and additionally reveal its potential for more data-efficient pretraining. We hope our success can advance VideoQA beyond coarse recognition/description towards fine-grained relation reasoning of video contents.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Semantic communication is considered the future of mobile communication, which aims to transmit data beyond Shannon's theorem of communications by transmitting the semantic meaning of the data rather than the bit-by-bit reconstruction of the data at the receiver's end. The semantic communication paradigm aims to bridge the gap of limited bandwidth problems in modern high-volume multimedia application content transmission. Integrating AI technologies with the 6G communications networks paved the way to develop semantic communication-based end-to-end communication systems. In this study, we have implemented a semantic communication-based end-to-end image transmission system, and we discuss potential design considerations in developing semantic communication systems in conjunction with physical channel characteristics. A Pre-trained GAN network is used at the receiver as the transmission task to reconstruct the realistic image based on the Semantic segmented image at the receiver input. The semantic segmentation task at the transmitter (encoder) and the GAN network at the receiver (decoder) is trained on a common knowledge base, the COCO-Stuff dataset. The research shows that the resource gain in the form of bandwidth saving is immense when transmitting the semantic segmentation map through the physical channel instead of the ground truth image in contrast to conventional communication systems. Furthermore, the research studies the effect of physical channel distortions and quantization noise on semantic communication-based multimedia content transmission. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Enabled by multi-head self-attention, Transformer has exhibited remarkable results in speech emotion recognition (SER). Compared to the original full attention mechanism, window-based attention is more effective in learning fine-grained features while greatly reducing model redundancy. However, emotional cues are present in a multi-granularity manner such that the pre-defined fixed window can severely degrade the model flexibility. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the optimal window settings manually. In this paper, we propose a Deformable Speech Transformer, named DST, for SER task. DST determines the usage of window sizes conditioned on input speech via a light-weight decision network. Meanwhile, data-dependent offsets derived from acoustic features are utilized to adjust the positions of the attention windows, allowing DST to adaptively discover and attend to the valuable information embedded in the speech. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate the superiority of DST. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Efficiently training accurate deep models for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is challenging and important. Recently, end-to-end WSSS methods have become the focus of research due to their high training efficiency. However, current methods suffer from insufficient extraction of comprehensive semantic information, resulting in low-quality pseudo-labels and sub-optimal solutions for end-to-end WSSS. To this end, we propose a simple and novel Self Correspondence Distillation (SCD) method to refine pseudo-labels without introducing external supervision. Our SCD enables the network to utilize feature correspondence derived from itself as a distillation target, which can enhance the network's feature learning process by complementing semantic information. In addition, to further improve the segmentation accuracy, we design a Variation-aware Refine Module to enhance the local consistency of pseudo-labels by computing pixel-level variation. Finally, we present an efficient end-to-end Transformer-based framework (TSCD) via SCD and Variation-aware Refine Module for the accurate WSSS task. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work aims at hierarchical multi-label patents classification for patents disclosing technologies related to green plastics. This is an emerging field for which there is currently no classification scheme, and hence, no labeled data is available, making this task particularly challenging. We first propose a classification scheme for this technology and a way to learn a machine learning model to classify patents into the proposed classification scheme. To achieve this, we come up with a strategy to automatically assign labels to patents in order to create a labeled training dataset that can be used to learn a classification model in a supervised learning setting. Using said training dataset, we come up with two classification models, a SciBERT Neural Network (SBNN) model and a SciBERT Hierarchical Neural Network (SBHNN) model. Both models use a BERT model as a feature extractor and on top of it, a neural network as a classifier. We carry out extensive experiments and report commonly evaluation metrics for this challenging classification problem. The experiment results verify the validity of our approach and show that our model sets a very strong benchmark for this problem. We also interpret our models by visualizing the word importance given by the trained model, which indicates the model is capable to extract high-level semantic information of input documents. Finally, we highlight how our solution fulfills the evaluation criteria for the EPO CodeFest and we also outline possible directions for future work.

For example, for the question-answering task, the GPLMs leverage the knowledge and linguistic patterns learned at training to produce an answer to a user question. Aside from the knowledge encoded in the model itself, answers produced by GPLMs can also leverage knowledge provided in the prompts. For example, a GPLM can be integrated into a retrieve-then-generate paradigm where a search engine is used to retrieve documents relevant to the question; the content of the documents is then transferred to the GPLM via the prompt. In this paper we study the differences in answer correctness generated by ChatGPT when leveraging the model's knowledge alone vs. in combination with the prompt knowledge. We study this in the context of consumers seeking health advice from the model. Aside from measuring the effectiveness of ChatGPT in this context, we show that the knowledge passed in the prompt can overturn the knowledge encoded in the model and this is, in our experiments, to the detriment of answer correctness. This work has important implications for the development of more robust and transparent question-answering systems based on generative pre-trained language models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, has gained widespread popularity and media attention since its release in November 2022. However, little hard evidence is available regarding its perception in various sources. In this paper, we analyze over 300,000 tweets and more than 150 scientific papers to investigate how ChatGPT is perceived and discussed. Our findings show that ChatGPT is generally viewed as of high quality, with positive sentiment and emotions of joy dominating in social media. Its perception has slightly decreased since its debut, however, with joy decreasing and (negative) surprise on the rise, and it is perceived more negatively in languages other than English. In recent scientific papers, ChatGPT is characterized as a great opportunity across various fields including the medical domain, but also as a threat concerning ethics and receives mixed assessments for education. Our comprehensive meta-analysis of ChatGPT's current perception after 2.5 months since its release can contribute to shaping the public debate and informing its future development. We make our data available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Although numerous solutions have been proposed for image super-resolution, they are usually incompatible with low-power devices with many computational and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a simple yet effective deep network to solve image super-resolution efficiently. In detail, we develop a spatially-adaptive feature modulation (SAFM) mechanism upon a vision transformer (ViT)-like block. Within it, we first apply the SAFM block over input features to dynamically select representative feature representations. As the SAFM block processes the input features from a long-range perspective, we further introduce a convolutional channel mixer (CCM) to simultaneously extract local contextual information and perform channel mixing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is $3\times$ smaller than state-of-the-art efficient SR methods, e.g., IMDN, in terms of the network parameters and requires less computational cost while achieving comparable performance.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study the performance of a commercially available large language model (LLM) known as ChatGPT on math word problems (MWPs) from the dataset DRAW-1K. To our knowledge, this is the first independent evaluation of ChatGPT. We found that ChatGPT's performance changes dramatically based on the requirement to show its work, failing 20% of the time when it provides work compared with 84% when it does not. Further several factors about MWPs relating to the number of unknowns and number of operations that lead to a higher probability of failure when compared with the prior, specifically noting (across all experiments) that the probability of failure increases linearly with the number of addition and subtraction operations. We also have released the dataset of ChatGPT's responses to the MWPs to support further work on the characterization of LLM performance and present baseline machine learning models to predict if ChatGPT can correctly answer an MWP. We have released a dataset comprised of ChatGPT's responses to support further research in this area. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising diffusion models are a popular class of generative models providing state-of-the-art results in many domains. One adds gradually noise to data using a diffusion to transform the data distribution into a Gaussian distribution. Samples from the generative model are then obtained by simulating an approximation of the time-reversal of this diffusion initialized by Gaussian samples. Practically, the intractable score terms appearing in the time-reversed process are approximated using score matching techniques. We explore here a similar idea to sample approximately from unnormalized probability density functions and estimate their normalizing constants. We consider a process where the target density diffuses towards a Gaussian. Denoising Diffusion Samplers (DDS) are obtained by approximating the corresponding time-reversal. While score matching is not applicable in this context, we can leverage many of the ideas introduced in generative modeling for Monte Carlo sampling. Existing theoretical results from denoising diffusion models also provide theoretical guarantees for DDS. We discuss the connections between DDS, optimal control and Schr\"odinger bridges and finally demonstrate DDS experimentally on a variety of challenging sampling tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most deep trackers still follow the guidance of the siamese paradigms and use a template that contains only the target without any contextual information, which makes it difficult for the tracker to cope with large appearance changes, rapid target movement, and attraction from similar objects. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a long-term context attention (LCA) module that can perform extensive information fusion on the target and its context from long-term frames, and calculate the target correlation while enhancing target features. The complete contextual information contains the location of the target as well as the state around the target. LCA uses the target state from the previous frame to exclude the interference of similar objects and complex backgrounds, thus accurately locating the target and enabling the tracker to obtain higher robustness and regression accuracy. By embedding the LCA module in Transformer, we build a powerful online tracker with a target-aware backbone, termed as TATrack. In addition, we propose a dynamic online update algorithm based on the classification confidence of historical information without additional calculation burden. Our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with 71.1\% AUC, 89.3\% NP, and 73.0\% AO on LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The ability to generate privacy-preserving synthetic versions of sensitive image datasets could unlock numerous ML applications currently constrained by data availability. Due to their astonishing image generation quality, diffusion models are a prime candidate for generating high-quality synthetic data. However, recent studies have found that, by default, the outputs of some diffusion models do not preserve training data privacy. By privately fine-tuning ImageNet pre-trained diffusion models with more than 80M parameters, we obtain SOTA results on CIFAR-10 and Camelyon17 in terms of both FID and the accuracy of downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data. We decrease the SOTA FID on CIFAR-10 from 26.2 to 9.8, and increase the accuracy from 51.0% to 88.0%. On synthetic data from Camelyon17, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 91.1% which is close to the SOTA of 96.5% when training on the real data. We leverage the ability of generative models to create infinite amounts of data to maximise the downstream prediction performance, and further show how to use synthetic data for hyperparameter tuning. Our results demonstrate that diffusion models fine-tuned with differential privacy can produce useful and provably private synthetic data, even in applications with significant distribution shift between the pre-training and fine-tuning distributions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: "Green Premiums" which means the difference in cost between emissions-emitting technology and zero-emissions or emissions-reducing technology is significant for those renewable energy technology to address the climate change challenge facing the world in this century. China's Electrical Vehicles (EVs) industry is the first to cross the green premium into the commercialization stage, prompting its market size to exceed that of the US and EU combined, making it the most inspiring case in global carbon reduction practices. This study, which is based on first-hand data from industry research and innovatively constructs a multi-factor green premium model for EVs based on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis, finds that EVs currently have a higher green premium than Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) and is expected that short-range EVs will be the first to achieve parity in acquisition costs by 2025 and long-range EVs by 2030. Further, this paper constructs a generalized Bass diffusion model considering the green premium, selects the time series data of EVs diffusion in the Chinese market from 2010-2021, and uses a genetic algorithm to fit the parameters to predict the EVs market penetration in the next ten years under different scenarios. The model prediction results show that EVs are successful innovative diffusion products and the market penetration rate depends largely on their green premium. The Chinese EVs market may experience a slowdown or even a decline in growth in the short term, but will maintain high growth in the medium to long term, with annual sales expected to reach 10.77 million units by 2030 and a penetration rate of about 39%. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

To the best of our knowledge, most of the state-of-the-art works in this field have focused on using tree-like structures and linguistic modeling. But, these approaches are not able to model more complex structures which are often found in online forums and real world argumentation structures. In this paper, a novel methodology for argument mining is proposed which employs attention-based embeddings for link prediction to model the causational hierarchies in typical argument structures prevalent in online discourse. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with pure binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on three model variants: 45M, 125M and 260M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is 4x larger than any functional backprop-trained SNN to date. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity to linear with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 5x less energy consumption when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, many video tasks have achieved breakthroughs by utilizing the vision transformer and establishing spatial-temporal decoupling for feature extraction. Although multi-view 3D reconstruction also faces multiple images as input, it cannot immediately inherit their success due to completely ambiguous associations between unordered views. There is not usable prior relationship, which is similar to the temporally-coherence property in a video. To solve this problem, we propose a novel transformer network for Unordered Multiple Images (UMIFormer). It exploits transformer blocks for decoupled intra-view encoding and designed blocks for token rectification that mine the correlation between similar tokens from different views to achieve decoupled inter-view encoding. Afterward, all tokens acquired from various branches are compressed into a fixed-size compact representation while preserving rich information for reconstruction by leveraging the similarities between tokens. We empirically demonstrate on ShapeNet and confirm that our decoupled learning method is adaptable for unordered multiple images. Meanwhile, the experiments also verify our model outperforms existing SOTA methods by a large margin. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With adversarial or otherwise normal prompts, existing large language models (LLM) can be pushed to generate toxic discourses. One way to reduce the risk of LLMs generating undesired discourses is to alter the training of the LLM. This can be very restrictive due to demanding computation requirements. Other methods rely on rule-based or prompt-based token elimination, which are limited as they dismiss future tokens and the overall meaning of the complete discourse. Here, we center detoxification on the probability that the finished discourse is ultimately considered toxic. That is, at each point, we advise against token selections proportional to how likely a finished text from this point will be toxic. To this end, we formally extend the dead-end theory from the recent reinforcement learning (RL) literature to also cover uncertain outcomes. Our approach, called rectification, utilizes a separate but significantly smaller model for detoxification, which can be applied to diverse LLMs as long as they share the same vocabulary. Importantly, our method does not require access to the internal representations of the LLM, but only the token probability distribution at each decoding step. This is crucial as many LLMs today are hosted in servers and only accessible through APIs. When applied to various LLMs, including GPT-3, our approach significantly improves the generated discourse compared to the base LLMs and other techniques in terms of both the overall language and detoxification performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promising performance in self-supervised learning for both 2D and 3D computer vision. However, existing MAE-style methods can only learn from the data of a single modality, i.e., either images or point clouds, which neglect the implicit semantic and geometric correlation between 2D and 3D. In this paper, we explore how the 2D modality can benefit 3D masked autoencoding, and propose Joint-MAE, a 2D-3D joint MAE framework for self-supervised 3D point cloud pre-training. Joint-MAE randomly masks an input 3D point cloud and its projected 2D images, and then reconstructs the masked information of the two modalities. For better cross-modal interaction, we construct our JointMAE by two hierarchical 2D-3D embedding modules, a joint encoder, and a joint decoder with modal-shared and model-specific decoders. On top of this, we further introduce two cross-modal strategies to boost the 3D representation learning, which are local-aligned attention mechanisms for 2D-3D semantic cues, and a cross-reconstruction loss for 2D-3D geometric constraints. By our pre-training paradigm, Joint-MAE achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks, e.g., 92.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40 and 86.07% accuracy on the hardest split of ScanObjectNN. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in state-of-the-art DNN architecture design have been moving toward Transformer models. These models achieve superior accuracy across a wide range of applications. This trend has been consistent over the past several years since Transformer models were originally introduced. However, the amount of compute and bandwidth required for inference of recent Transformer models is growing at a significant rate, and this has made their deployment in latency-sensitive applications challenging. As such, there has been an increased focus on making Transformer models more efficient, with methods that range from changing the architecture design, all the way to developing dedicated domain-specific accelerators. In this work, we survey different approaches for efficient Transformer inference, including: (i) analysis and profiling of the bottlenecks in existing Transformer architectures and their similarities and differences with previous convolutional models; (ii) implications of Transformer architecture on hardware, including the impact of non-linear operations such as Layer Normalization, Softmax, and GELU, as well as linear operations, on hardware design; (iii) approaches for optimizing a fixed Transformer architecture; (iv) challenges in finding the right mapping and scheduling of operations for Transformer models; and (v) approaches for optimizing Transformer models by adapting the architecture using neural architecture search. Finally, we perform a case study by applying the surveyed optimizations on Gemmini, the open-source, full-stack DNN accelerator generator, and we show how each of these approaches can yield improvements, compared to previous benchmark results on Gemmini. Among other things, we find that a full-stack co-design approach with the aforementioned methods can result in up to 88.7x speedup with a minimal performance degradation for Transformer inference. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Modern vision models typically rely on fine-tuning general-purpose models pre-trained on large, static datasets. These general-purpose models only capture the knowledge within their pre-training datasets, which are tiny, out-of-date snapshots of the Internet -- where billions of images are uploaded each day. We suggest an alternate approach: rather than hoping our static datasets transfer to our desired tasks after large-scale pre-training, we propose dynamically utilizing the Internet to quickly train a small-scale model that does extremely well on the task at hand. Our approach, called Internet Explorer, explores the web in a self-supervised manner to progressively find relevant examples that improve performance on a desired target dataset. It cycles between searching for images on the Internet with text queries, self-supervised training on downloaded images, determining which images were useful, and prioritizing what to search for next. We evaluate Internet Explorer across several datasets and show that it outperforms or matches CLIP oracle performance by using just a single GPU desktop to actively query the Internet for 30--40 hours.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPM) have been widely adopted in image-to-image translation to generate high-quality images. Prior attempts at applying the DPM to image super-resolution (SR) have shown that iteratively refining a pure Gaussian noise with a conditional image using a U-Net trained on denoising at various-level noises can help obtain a satisfied high-resolution image for the low-resolution one. To further improve the performance and simplify current DPM-based super-resolution methods, we propose a simple but non-trivial DPM-based super-resolution post-process framework,i.e., cDPMSR. After applying a pre-trained SR model on the to-be-test LR image to provide the conditional input, we adapt the standard DPM to conduct conditional image generation and perform super-resolution through a deterministic iterative denoising process. Our method surpasses prior attempts on both qualitative and quantitative results and can generate more photo-realistic counterparts for the low-resolution images with various benchmark datasets including Set5, Set14, Urban100, BSD100, and Manga109. Code will be published after accepted. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Composite materials with 3D architectures are desirable in a variety of applications for the capability of tailoring their properties to meet multiple functional requirements. By the arrangement of materials' internal components, structure design is of great significance in tuning the properties of the composites. However, most of the composite structures are proposed by empirical designs following existing patterns. Hindered by the complexity of 3D structures, it is hard to extract customized structures with multiple desired properties from large design space. Here we report a multi-objective driven Wasserstein generative adversarial network (MDWGAN) to implement inverse designs of 3D composite structures according to given geometrical, structural and mechanical requirements. Our framework consists a GAN based network which generates 3D composite structures possessing with similar geometrical and structural features to the target dataset. Besides, multiple objectives are introduced to our framework for the control of mechanical property and isotropy of the composites. Real time calculation of the properties in training iterations is achieved by an accurate surrogate model. We constructed a small and concise dataset to illustrate our framework. With multiple objectives combined by their weight, and the 3D-GAN act as a soft constraint, our framework is proved to be capable of tuning the properties of the generated composites in multiple aspects, while keeping the selected features of different kinds of structures. The feasibility on small dataset and potential scalability on objectives of other properties make our work a novel, effective approach to provide fast, experience free composite structure designs for various functional materials. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pause insertion, also known as phrase break prediction and phrasing, is an essential part of TTS systems because proper pauses with natural duration significantly enhance the rhythm and intelligibility of synthetic speech. However, conventional phrasing models ignore various speakers' different styles of inserting silent pauses, which can degrade the performance of the model trained on a multi-speaker speech corpus. To this end, we propose more powerful pause insertion frameworks based on a pre-trained language model. Our approach uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) pre-trained on a large-scale text corpus, injecting speaker embedding to capture various speaker characteristics. We also leverage duration-aware pause insertion for more natural multi-speaker TTS. We develop and evaluate two types of models. The first improves conventional phrasing models on the position prediction of respiratory pauses (RPs), i.e., silent pauses at word transitions without punctuation. It performs speaker-conditioned RP prediction considering contextual information and is used to demonstrate the effect of speaker information on the prediction. The second model is further designed for phoneme-based TTS models and performs duration-aware pause insertion, predicting both RPs and punctuation-indicated pauses (PIPs) that are categorized by duration. The evaluation results show that our models improve the precision and recall of pause insertion and the rhythm of synthetic speech. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The emerging classical-quantum transfer learning paradigm has brought a decent performance to quantum computational models in many tasks, such as computer vision, by enabling a combination of quantum models and classical pre-trained neural networks. However, using quantum computing with pre-trained models has yet to be explored in natural language processing (NLP). Due to the high linearity constraints of the underlying quantum computing infrastructures, existing Quantum NLP models are limited in performance on real tasks. We fill this gap by pre-training a sentence state with complex-valued BERT-like architecture, and adapting it to the classical-quantum transfer learning scheme for sentence classification. On quantum simulation experiments, the pre-trained representation can bring 50\% to 60\% increases to the capacity of end-to-end quantum models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper explores the novel deep learning Transformers architectures for high-frequency Bitcoin-USDT log-return forecasting and compares them to the traditional Long Short-Term Memory models. A hybrid Transformer model, called \textbf{HFformer}, is then introduced for time series forecasting which incorporates a Transformer encoder, linear decoder, spiking activations, and quantile loss function, and does not use position encoding. Furthermore, possible high-frequency trading strategies for use with the HFformer model are discussed, including trade sizing, trading signal aggregation, and minimal trading threshold. Ultimately, the performance of the HFformer and Long Short-Term Memory models are assessed and results indicate that the HFformer achieves a higher cumulative PnL than the LSTM when trading with multiple signals during backtesting. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We developed a fast and modular deep learning algorithm to search for lookalike signals of interest in radio spectrogram data. First, we trained an autoencoder on filtered data returned by an energy detection algorithm. We then adapted a positional embedding layer from classical Transformer architecture to a frequency-based embedding. Next we used the encoder component of the autoencoder to extract features from small (~ 715,Hz with a resolution of 2.79Hz per frequency bin) windows in the radio spectrogram. We used our algorithm to conduct a search for a given query (encoded signal of interest) on a set of signals (encoded features of searched items) to produce the top candidates with similar features. We successfully demonstrate that the algorithm retrieves signals with similar appearance, given only the original radio spectrogram data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Due to the data shortage problem, which is one of the major problems in the field of machine learning, the accuracy level of many applications remains well below the expected. It prevents researchers from producing new artificial intelligence-based systems with the available data. This problem can be solved by generating new synthetic data with augmentation methods. In this study, new ECG signals are produced using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database by using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GAN), which is a modern data augmentation method. These generated data are used for training a machine learning system and real ECG data for testing it. The obtained results show that this way the performance of the machine learning system is increased. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
