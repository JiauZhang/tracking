### [Assessing the Capacity of Transformer to Abstract Syntactic  Representations: A Contrastive Analysis Based on Long-distance Agreement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04523)
The long-distance agreement, evidence for syntactic structure, is increasingly used to assess the syntactic generalization of Neural Language Models. Much work has shown that transformers are capable of high accuracy in varied agreement tasks, but the mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior are still not well understood. To better understand transformers' internal working, this work contrasts how they handle two superficially similar but theoretically distinct agreement phenomena: subject-verb and object-past participle agreement in French. Using probing and counterfactual analysis methods, our experiments show that i) the agreement task suffers from several confounders which partially question the conclusions drawn so far and ii) transformers handle subject-verb and object-past participle agreements in a way that is consistent with their modeling in theoretical linguistics. 

### [STLGRU: Spatio-Temporal Lightweight Graph GRU for Traffic Flow  Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04548)
Reliable forecasting of traffic flow requires efficient modeling of traffic data. Different correlations and influences arise in a dynamic traffic network, making modeling a complicated task. Existing literature has proposed many different methods to capture the complex underlying spatial-temporal relations of traffic networks. However, methods still struggle to capture different local and global dependencies of long-range nature. Also, as more and more sophisticated methods are being proposed, models are increasingly becoming memory-heavy and, thus, unsuitable for low-powered devices. In this paper, we focus on solving these problems by proposing a novel deep learning framework - STLGRU. Specifically, our proposed STLGRU can effectively capture both local and global spatial-temporal relations of a traffic network using memory-augmented attention and gating mechanism. Instead of employing separate temporal and spatial components, we show that our memory module and gated unit can learn the spatial-temporal dependencies successfully, allowing for reduced memory usage with fewer parameters. We extensively experiment on several real-world traffic prediction datasets to show that our model performs better than existing methods while the memory footprint remains lower. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Kishor-Bhaumik/STLGRU}. 

### [Modularity through Attention: Efficient Training and Transfer of  Language-Conditioned Policies for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04573)
Language-conditioned policies allow robots to interpret and execute human instructions. Learning such policies requires a substantial investment with regards to time and compute resources. Still, the resulting controllers are highly device-specific and cannot easily be transferred to a robot with different morphology, capability, appearance or dynamics. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient approach for training language-conditioned manipulation policies that allows for rapid transfer across different types of robots. By introducing a novel method, namely Hierarchical Modularity, and adopting supervised attention across multiple sub-modules, we bridge the divide between modular and end-to-end learning and enable the reuse of functional building blocks. In both simulated and real world robot manipulation experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods and can transfer policies across 4 different robots in a sample-efficient manner. Finally, we show that the functionality of learned sub-modules is maintained beyond the training process and can be used to introspect the robot decision-making process. Code is available at https://github.com/ir-lab/ModAttn. 

### [Hide, Not Seek: Perceived Fairness in Envy-Free Allocations of  Indivisible Goods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04574)
Fair division provides a rich computational and mathematical framework for the allocation of indivisible goods, which has given rise to numerous fairness concepts and their relaxations. In recent years, much attention has been given to theoretical and computational aspects of various fairness concepts. Nonetheless, the choice of which fairness concept is in practice perceived to be fairer by individuals is not well understood. We consider two conceptually different relaxations of envy-freeness and investigate how individuals perceive the induced allocations as fair. In particular, we examine a well-studied relaxation of envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) which is based on counterfactual thinking that any pairwise envy can be eliminated by the hypothetical removal of a single good from the envied agent's bundle. In contrast, a recently proposed epistemic notion, namely envy-freeness up to $k$ hidden goods (HEF-$k$), provides a relaxation by hiding information about a small subset of $k$ goods. Through various crowdsourcing experiments, we empirically demonstrate that allocations achieved by withholding information are perceived to be fairer compared to two variants of EF1. 

### [Explain to me like I am five -- Sentence Simplification Using  Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04595)
Sentence simplification aims at making the structure of text easier to read and understand while maintaining its original meaning. This can be helpful for people with disabilities, new language learners, or those with low literacy. Simplification often involves removing difficult words and rephrasing the sentence. Previous research have focused on tackling this task by either using external linguistic databases for simplification or by using control tokens for desired fine-tuning of sentences. However, in this paper we purely use pre-trained transformer models. We experiment with a combination of GPT-2 and BERT models, achieving the best SARI score of 46.80 on the Mechanical Turk dataset, which is significantly better than previous state-of-the-art results. The code can be found at https://github.com/amanbasu/sentence-simplification. 

### [On Distribution Grid Optimal Power Flow Development and Integration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04616)
Due to changes in electric distribution grid operation, new operation regimes have been recommended. Distribution grid optimal power flow (DOPF) has received tremendous attention in the research community, yet it has not been fully adopted across the utility industry. Our paper recognizes this problem and suggests a development and integration procedure for DOPF. We propose development of DOPF as a three step procedure of 1) processing the grid, 2) obtaining a tractable solution, and 3) implementing multiple solution algorithms and benchmarking them to improve application reliability. For the integration of DOPF, we demonstrate how a DOPF federate may be developed that can be integrated in a co-simulation environment to mimic the real-world conditions and hence improve its practicality to be deployed in the field. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, tests on IEEE 123-bus system are performed where the usage of tractable formulation in DOPF algorithm development and its comparison to the benchmark solution are demonstrated. 

### [Ego-Body Pose Estimation via Ego-Head Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04636)
Estimating 3D human motion from an egocentric video sequence is critical to human behavior understanding and applications in VR/AR. However, naively learning a mapping between egocentric videos and human motions is challenging, because the user's body is often unobserved by the front-facing camera placed on the head of the user. In addition, collecting large-scale, high-quality datasets with paired egocentric videos and 3D human motions requires accurate motion capture devices, which often limit the variety of scenes in the videos to lab-like environments. To eliminate the need for paired egocentric video and human motions, we propose a new method, Ego-Body Pose Estimation via Ego-Head Pose Estimation (EgoEgo), that decomposes the problem into two stages, connected by the head motion as an intermediate representation. EgoEgo first integrates SLAM and a learning approach to estimate accurate head motion. Then, taking the estimated head pose as input, it leverages conditional diffusion to generate multiple plausible full-body motions. This disentanglement of head and body pose eliminates the need for training datasets with paired egocentric videos and 3D human motion, enabling us to leverage large-scale egocentric video datasets and motion capture datasets separately. Moreover, for systematic benchmarking, we develop a synthetic dataset, AMASS-Replica-Ego-Syn (ARES), with paired egocentric videos and human motion. On both ARES and real data, our EgoEgo model performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art. 

### [MIMO Is All You Need : A Strong Multi-In-Multi-Out Baseline for Video  Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04655)
The mainstream of the existing approaches for video prediction builds up their models based on a Single-In-Single-Out (SISO) architecture, which takes the current frame as input to predict the next frame in a recursive manner. This way often leads to severe performance degradation when they try to extrapolate a longer period of future, thus limiting the practical use of the prediction model. Alternatively, a Multi-In-Multi-Out (MIMO) architecture that outputs all the future frames at one shot naturally breaks the recursive manner and therefore prevents error accumulation. However, only a few MIMO models for video prediction are proposed and they only achieve inferior performance due to the date. The real strength of the MIMO model in this area is not well noticed and is largely under-explored. Motivated by that, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in this paper to thoroughly exploit how far a simple MIMO architecture can go. Surprisingly, our empirical studies reveal that a simple MIMO model can outperform the state-of-the-art work with a large margin much more than expected, especially in dealing with longterm error accumulation. After exploring a number of ways and designs, we propose a new MIMO architecture based on extending the pure Transformer with local spatio-temporal blocks and a new multi-output decoder, namely MIMO-VP, to establish a new standard in video prediction. We evaluate our model in four highly competitive benchmarks (Moving MNIST, Human3.6M, Weather, KITTI). Extensive experiments show that our model wins 1st place on all the benchmarks with remarkable performance gains and surpasses the best SISO model in all aspects including efficiency, quantity, and quality. We believe our model can serve as a new baseline to facilitate the future research of video prediction tasks. The code will be released. 

### [An Attention-based Multi-Scale Feature Learning Network for Multimodal  Medical Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04661)
Medical images play an important role in clinical applications. Multimodal medical images could provide rich information about patients for physicians to diagnose. The image fusion technique is able to synthesize complementary information from multimodal images into a single image. This technique will prevent radiologists switch back and forth between different images and save lots of time in the diagnostic process. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dilated Residual Attention Network for the medical image fusion task. Our network is capable to extract multi-scale deep semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel fixed fusion strategy termed Softmax-based weighted strategy based on the Softmax weights and matrix nuclear norm. Extensive experiments show our proposed network and fusion strategy exceed the state-of-the-art performance compared with reference image fusion methods on four commonly used fusion metrics. 

### [AugNet: Dynamic Test-Time Augmentation via Differentiable Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04681)
Distribution shifts, which often occur in the real world, degrade the accuracy of deep learning systems, and thus improving robustness is essential for practical applications. To improve robustness, we study an image enhancement method that generates recognition-friendly images without retraining the recognition model. We propose a novel image enhancement method, AugNet, which is based on differentiable data augmentation techniques and generates a blended image from many augmented images to improve the recognition accuracy under distribution shifts. In addition to standard data augmentations, AugNet can also incorporate deep neural network-based image transformation, which further improves the robustness. Because AugNet is composed of differentiable functions, AugNet can be directly trained with the classification loss of the recognition model. AugNet is evaluated on widely used image recognition datasets using various classification models, including Vision Transformer and MLP-Mixer. AugNet improves the robustness with almost no reduction in classification accuracy for clean images, which is a better result than the existing methods. Furthermore, we show that interpretation of distribution shifts using AugNet and retraining based on that interpretation can greatly improve robustness. 

### [Attention in a family of Boltzmann machines emerging from modern  Hopfield networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04692)
Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines (BMs) are fundamental energy-based neural network models. Recent studies on modern Hopfield networks have broaden the class of energy functions and led to a unified perspective on general Hopfield networks including an attention module. In this letter, we consider the BM counterparts of modern Hopfield networks using the associated energy functions, and study their salient properties from a trainability perspective. In particular, the energy function corresponding to the attention module naturally introduces a novel BM, which we refer to as attentional BM (AttnBM). We verify that AttnBM has a tractable likelihood function and gradient for a special case and is easy to train. Moreover, we reveal the hidden connections between AttnBM and some single-layer models, namely the Gaussian--Bernoulli restricted BM and denoising autoencoder with softmax units. We also investigate BMs introduced by other energy functions, and in particular, observe that the energy function of dense associative memory models gives BMs belonging to Exponential Family Harmoniums. 

### [Tencent AVS: A Holistic Ads Video Dataset for Multi-modal Scene  Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04700)
Temporal video segmentation and classification have been advanced greatly by public benchmarks in recent years. However, such research still mainly focuses on human actions, failing to describe videos in a holistic view. In addition, previous research tends to pay much attention to visual information yet ignores the multi-modal nature of videos. To fill this gap, we construct the Tencent `Ads Video Segmentation'~(TAVS) dataset in the ads domain to escalate multi-modal video analysis to a new level. TAVS describes videos from three independent perspectives as `presentation form', `place', and `style', and contains rich multi-modal information such as video, audio, and text. TAVS is organized hierarchically in semantic aspects for comprehensive temporal video segmentation with three levels of categories for multi-label classification, e.g., `place' - `working place' - `office'. Therefore, TAVS is distinguished from previous temporal segmentation datasets due to its multi-modal information, holistic view of categories, and hierarchical granularities. It includes 12,000 videos, 82 classes, 33,900 segments, 121,100 shots, and 168,500 labels. Accompanied with TAVS, we also present a strong multi-modal video segmentation baseline coupled with multi-label class prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed method as well as existing representative methods to reveal key challenges of our dataset TAVS. 

### [4K-NeRF: High Fidelity Neural Radiance Fields at Ultra High Resolutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04701)
In this paper, we present a novel and effective framework, named 4K-NeRF, to pursue high fidelity view synthesis on the challenging scenarios of ultra high resolutions, building on the methodology of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The rendering procedure of NeRF-based methods typically relies on a pixel wise manner in which rays (or pixels) are treated independently on both training and inference phases, limiting its representational ability on describing subtle details especially when lifting to a extremely high resolution. We address the issue by better exploring ray correlation for enhancing high-frequency details benefiting from the use of geometry-aware local context. Particularly, we use the view-consistent encoder to model geometric information effectively in a lower resolution space and recover fine details through the view-consistent decoder, conditioned on ray features and depths estimated by the encoder. Joint training with patch-based sampling further facilitates our method incorporating the supervision from perception oriented regularization beyond pixel wise loss. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with modern NeRF methods demonstrate that our method can significantly boost rendering quality for retaining high-frequency details, achieving the state-of-the-art visual quality on 4K ultra-high-resolution scenario.

### [ShadowDiffusion: When Degradation Prior Meets Diffusion Model for Shadow  Removal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04711)
Recent deep learning methods have achieved promising results in image shadow removal. However, their restored images still suffer from unsatisfactory boundary artifacts, due to the lack of degradation prior embedding and the deficiency in modeling capacity. Our work addresses these issues by proposing a unified diffusion framework that integrates both the image and degradation priors for highly effective shadow removal. In detail, we first propose a shadow degradation model, which inspires us to build a novel unrolling diffusion model, dubbed ShandowDiffusion. It remarkably improves the model's capacity in shadow removal via progressively refining the desired output with both degradation prior and diffusive generative prior, which by nature can serve as a new strong baseline for image restoration. Furthermore, ShadowDiffusion progressively refines the estimated shadow mask as an auxiliary task of the diffusion generator, which leads to more accurate and robust shadow-free image generation. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular public datasets, including ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD, to validate our method's effectiveness. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves a significant improvement in terms of PSNR, increasing from 31.69dB to 34.73dB over SRD dataset. 

### [Fluctuations of Rare Event Simulation with Monte Carlo Splitting in the  Small Noise Asymptotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04750)
Diffusion processes with small noise conditioned to reach a target set are considered. The AMS algorithm is a Monte Carlo method that is used to sample such rare events by iteratively simulating clones of the process and selecting trajectories that have reached the highest value of a so-called importance function. In this paper, the large sample size relative variance of the AMS small probability estimator is considered. The main result is a large deviations logarithmic equivalent of the latter in the small noise asymptotics, which is rigorously derived. It is given as a maximisation problem explicit in terms of the quasi-potential cost function associated with the underlying small noise large deviations. Necessary and sufficient geometric conditions ensuring the vanishing of the obtained quantity ('weak' asymptotic efficiency) are provided. Interpretations and practical consequences are discussed. 

### [Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Dependency for Skeleton-Based Action  Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04761)
Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted considerable attention due to its compact skeletal structure of the human body. Many recent methods have achieved remarkable performance using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which extract spatial and temporal features, respectively. Although spatial and temporal dependencies in the human skeleton have been explored, spatio-temporal dependency is rarely considered. In this paper, we propose the Inter-Frame Curve Network (IFC-Net) to effectively leverage the spatio-temporal dependency of the human skeleton. Our proposed network consists of two novel elements: 1) The Inter-Frame Curve (IFC) module; and 2) Dilated Graph Convolution (D-GC). The IFC module increases the spatio-temporal receptive field by identifying meaningful node connections between every adjacent frame and generating spatio-temporal curves based on the identified node connections. The D-GC allows the network to have a large spatial receptive field, which specifically focuses on the spatial domain. The kernels of D-GC are computed from the given adjacency matrices of the graph and reflect large receptive field in a way similar to the dilated CNNs. Our IFC-Net combines these two modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks: NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA. 

### [PromptonomyViT: Multi-Task Prompt Learning Improves Video Transformers  using Synthetic Scene Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04821)
Action recognition models have achieved impressive results by incorporating scene-level annotations, such as objects, their relations, 3D structure, and more. However, obtaining annotations of scene structure for videos requires a significant amount of effort to gather and annotate, making these methods expensive to train. In contrast, synthetic datasets generated by graphics engines provide powerful alternatives for generating scene-level annotations across multiple tasks. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage synthetic scene data for improving video understanding. We present a multi-task prompt learning approach for video transformers, where a shared video transformer backbone is enhanced by a small set of specialized parameters for each task. Specifically, we add a set of ``task prompts'', each corresponding to a different task, and let each prompt predict task-related annotations. This design allows the model to capture information shared among synthetic scene tasks as well as information shared between synthetic scene tasks and a real video downstream task throughout the entire network. We refer to this approach as ``Promptonomy'', since the prompts model a task-related structure. We propose the PromptonomyViT model (PViT), a video transformer that incorporates various types of scene-level information from synthetic data using the ``Promptonomy'' approach. PViT shows strong performance improvements on multiple video understanding tasks and datasets. 

### [GazeNeRF: 3D-Aware Gaze Redirection with Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04823)
We propose GazeNeRF, a 3D-aware method for the task of gaze redirection. Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate 3D consistent results. Instead, we build on the intuition that the face region and eyeballs are separate 3D structures that move in a coordinated yet independent fashion. Our method leverages recent advancements in conditional image-based neural radiance fields and proposes a two-stream architecture that predicts volumetric features for the face and eye regions separately. Rigidly transforming the eye features via a 3D rotation matrix provides fine-grained control over the desired gaze angle. The final, redirected image is then attained via differentiable volume compositing. Our experiments show that this architecture outperforms naively conditioned NeRF baselines as well as previous state-of-the-art 2D gaze redirection methods in terms of redirection accuracy and identity preservation. 

### [RCDT: Relational Remote Sensing Change Detection with Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04869)
Deep learning based change detection methods have received wide attentoion, thanks to their strong capability in obtaining rich features from images. However, existing AI-based CD methods largely rely on three functionality-enhancing modules, i.e., semantic enhancement, attention mechanisms, and correspondence enhancement. The stacking of these modules leads to great model complexity. To unify these three modules into a simple pipeline, we introduce Relational Change Detection Transformer (RCDT), a novel and simple framework for remote sensing change detection tasks. The proposed RCDT consists of three major components, a weight-sharing Siamese Backbone to obtain bi-temporal features, a Relational Cross Attention Module (RCAM) that implements offset cross attention to obtain bi-temporal relation-aware features, and a Features Constrain Module (FCM) to achieve the final refined predictions with high-resolution constraints. Extensive experiments on four different publically available datasets suggest that our proposed RCDT exhibits superior change detection performance compared with other competing methods. The therotical, methodogical, and experimental knowledge of this study is expected to benefit future change detection efforts that involve the cross attention mechanism. 

### [Multimodal Prototype-Enhanced Network for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04873)
Current methods for few-shot action recognition mainly fall into the metric learning framework following ProtoNet. However, they either ignore the effect of representative prototypes or fail to enhance the prototypes with multimodal information adequately. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype-Enhanced Network (MORN) to use the semantic information of label texts as multimodal information to enhance prototypes, including two modality flows. A CLIP visual encoder is introduced in the visual flow, and visual prototypes are computed by the Temporal-Relational CrossTransformer (TRX) module. A frozen CLIP text encoder is introduced in the text flow, and a semantic-enhanced module is used to enhance text features. After inflating, text prototypes are obtained. The final multimodal prototypes are then computed by a multimodal prototype-enhanced module. Besides, there exist no evaluation metrics to evaluate the quality of prototypes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a prototype evaluation metric called Prototype Similarity Difference (PRIDE), which is used to evaluate the performance of prototypes in discriminating different categories. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular datasets. MORN achieves state-of-the-art results on HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics and SSv2. MORN also performs well on PRIDE, and we explore the correlation between PRIDE and accuracy. 

### [A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for MCS Partial Search Order on Chordal  Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04880)
We study the partial search order problem (PSOP) proposed recently by Scheffler [WG 2022]. Given a graph $G$ together with a partial order over the vertices of $G$, this problem determines if there is an $\mathcal{S}$-ordering that is consistent with the given partial order, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a graph search paradigm like BFS, DFS, etc. This problem naturally generalizes the end-vertex problem which has received much attention over the past few years. It also generalizes the so-called ${\mathcal{F}}$-tree recognition problem which has just been studied in the literature recently. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for the PSOP on chordal graphs with respect to the maximum cardinality search (MCS). This resolves one of the most intriguing open questions left in the work of Sheffler [WG 2022]. To obtain our result, we propose the notion of layer structure and study numerous related structural properties which might be of independent interest. 

### [TRBLLmaker -- Transformer Reads Between Lyrics Lines maker](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04917)
Even for us, it can be challenging to comprehend the meaning of songs. As part of this project, we explore the process of generating the meaning of songs. Despite the widespread use of text-to-text models, few attempts have been made to achieve a similar objective. Songs are primarily studied in the context of sentiment analysis. This involves identifying opinions and emotions in texts, evaluating them as positive or negative, and utilizing these evaluations to make music recommendations. In this paper, we present a generative model that offers implicit meanings for several lines of a song. Our model uses a decoder Transformer architecture GPT-2, where the input is the lyrics of a song. Furthermore, we compared the performance of this architecture with that of the encoder-decoder Transformer architecture of the T5 model. We also examined the effect of different prompt types with the option of appending additional information, such as the name of the artist and the title of the song. Moreover, we tested different decoding methods with different training parameters and evaluated our results using ROUGE. In order to build our dataset, we utilized the 'Genious' API, which allowed us to acquire the lyrics of songs and their explanations, as well as their rich metadata. 

### [Towards High-Order Complementary Recommendation via Logical Reasoning  Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04966)
Complementary recommendation gains increasing attention in e-commerce since it expedites the process of finding frequently-bought-with products for users in their shopping journey. Therefore, learning the product representation that can reflect this complementary relationship plays a central role in modern recommender systems. In this work, we propose a logical reasoning network, LOGIREC, to effectively learn embeddings of products as well as various transformations (projection, intersection, negation) between them. LOGIREC is capable of capturing the asymmetric complementary relationship between products and seamlessly extending to high-order recommendations where more comprehensive and meaningful complementary relationship is learned for a query set of products. Finally, we further propose a hybrid network that is jointly optimized for learning a more generic product representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LOGIREC on multiple public real-world datasets in terms of various ranking-based metrics under both low-order and high-order recommendation scenarios. 

### [Masked Lip-Sync Prediction by Audio-Visual Contextual Exploitation in  Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04970)
Previous studies have explored generating accurately lip-synced talking faces for arbitrary targets given audio conditions. However, most of them deform or generate the whole facial area, leading to non-realistic results. In this work, we delve into the formulation of altering only the mouth shapes of the target person. This requires masking a large percentage of the original image and seamlessly inpainting it with the aid of audio and reference frames. To this end, we propose the Audio-Visual Context-Aware Transformer (AV-CAT) framework, which produces accurate lip-sync with photo-realistic quality by predicting the masked mouth shapes. Our key insight is to exploit desired contextual information provided in audio and visual modalities thoroughly with delicately designed Transformers. Specifically, we propose a convolution-Transformer hybrid backbone and design an attention-based fusion strategy for filling the masked parts. It uniformly attends to the textural information on the unmasked regions and the reference frame. Then the semantic audio information is involved in enhancing the self-attention computation. Additionally, a refinement network with audio injection improves both image and lip-sync quality. Extensive experiments validate that our model can generate high-fidelity lip-synced results for arbitrary subjects. 

### [Video-Text Modeling with Zero-Shot Transfer from Contrastive Captioners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04979)
This work explores an efficient approach to establish a foundational video-text model for tasks including open-vocabulary video classification, text-to-video retrieval, video captioning and video question-answering. We present VideoCoCa that reuses a pretrained image-text contrastive captioner (CoCa) model and adapt it to video-text tasks with minimal extra training. While previous works adapt image-text models with various cross-frame fusion modules (for example, cross-frame attention layer or perceiver resampler) and finetune the modified architecture on video-text data, we surprisingly find that the generative attentional pooling and contrastive attentional pooling layers in the image-text CoCa design are instantly adaptable to ``flattened frame embeddings'', yielding a strong zero-shot transfer baseline for many video-text tasks. Specifically, the frozen image encoder of a pretrained image-text CoCa takes each video frame as inputs and generates \(N\) token embeddings per frame for totally \(T\) video frames. We flatten \(N \times T\) token embeddings as a long sequence of frozen video representation and apply CoCa's generative attentional pooling and contrastive attentional pooling on top. All model weights including pooling layers are directly loaded from an image-text CoCa pretrained model. Without any video or video-text data, VideoCoCa's zero-shot transfer baseline already achieves state-of-the-art results on zero-shot video classification on Kinetics 400/600/700, UCF101, HMDB51, and Charades, as well as zero-shot text-to-video retrieval on MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions. We also explore lightweight finetuning on top of VideoCoCa, and achieve strong results on video question-answering (iVQA, MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA) and video captioning (MSR-VTT, ActivityNet, Youcook2). Our approach establishes a simple and effective video-text baseline for future research. 

### [Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Patch Aligned Contrastive  Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04994)
We introduce Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning (PACL), a modified compatibility function for CLIP's contrastive loss, intending to train an alignment between the patch tokens of the vision encoder and the CLS token of the text encoder. With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets. 

### [Training-Free Structured Diffusion Guidance for Compositional  Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05032)
Large-scale diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results on text-to-image synthesis (T2I) tasks. Despite their ability to generate high-quality yet creative images, we observe that attribution-binding and compositional capabilities are still considered major challenging issues, especially when involving multiple objects. In this work, we improve the compositional skills of T2I models, specifically more accurate attribute binding and better image compositions. To do this, we incorporate linguistic structures with the diffusion guidance process based on the controllable properties of manipulating cross-attention layers in diffusion-based T2I models. We observe that keys and values in cross-attention layers have strong semantic meanings associated with object layouts and content. Therefore, we can better preserve the compositional semantics in the generated image by manipulating the cross-attention representations based on linguistic insights. Built upon Stable Diffusion, a SOTA T2I model, our structured cross-attention design is efficient that requires no additional training samples. We achieve better compositional skills in qualitative and quantitative results, leading to a 5-8% advantage in head-to-head user comparison studies. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to reveal potential causes of incorrect image compositions and justify the properties of cross-attention layers in the generation process. 

### [SmartBrush: Text and Shape Guided Object Inpainting with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05034)
Generic image inpainting aims to complete a corrupted image by borrowing surrounding information, which barely generates novel content. By contrast, multi-modal inpainting provides more flexible and useful controls on the inpainted content, \eg, a text prompt can be used to describe an object with richer attributes, and a mask can be used to constrain the shape of the inpainted object rather than being only considered as a missing area. We propose a new diffusion-based model named SmartBrush for completing a missing region with an object using both text and shape-guidance. While previous work such as DALLE-2 and Stable Diffusion can do text-guided inapinting they do not support shape guidance and tend to modify background texture surrounding the generated object. Our model incorporates both text and shape guidance with precision control. To preserve the background better, we propose a novel training and sampling strategy by augmenting the diffusion U-net with object-mask prediction. Lastly, we introduce a multi-task training strategy by jointly training inpainting with text-to-image generation to leverage more training data. We conduct extensive experiments showing that our model outperforms all baselines in terms of visual quality, mask controllability, and background preservation. 

### [Incorporating Emotions into Health Mention Classification Task on Social  Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05039)
The health mention classification (HMC) task is the process of identifying and classifying mentions of health-related concepts in text. This can be useful for identifying and tracking the spread of diseases through social media posts. However, this is a non-trivial task. Here we build on recent studies suggesting that using emotional information may improve upon this task. Our study results in a framework for health mention classification that incorporates affective features. We present two methods, an intermediate task fine-tuning approach (implicit) and a multi-feature fusion approach (explicit) to incorporate emotions into our target task of HMC. We evaluated our approach on 5 HMC-related datasets from different social media platforms including three from Twitter, one from Reddit and another from a combination of social media sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach results in statistically significant performance gains on HMC tasks. By using the multi-feature fusion approach, we achieve at least a 3% improvement in F1 score over BERT baselines across all datasets. We also show that considering only negative emotions does not significantly affect performance on the HMC task. Additionally, our results indicate that HMC models infused with emotional knowledge are an effective alternative, especially when other HMC datasets are unavailable for domain-specific fine-tuning.

### [On Optimal Cell Average Decomposition for High-Order Bound-Preserving  Schemes of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05045)
This paper presents the first systematic study on the fundamental problem of seeking optimal cell average decomposition (OCAD), which arises from constructing efficient high-order bound-preserving (BP) numerical methods within Zhang--Shu framework. Since proposed in 2010, Zhang--Shu framework has attracted extensive attention and been applied to developing many high-order BP discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume schemes for various hyperbolic equations. An essential ingredient in the framework is the decomposition of the cell averages of the numerical solution into a convex combination of the solution values at certain quadrature points. The classic CAD originally proposed by Zhang and Shu has been widely used in the past decade. However, the feasible CADs are not unique, and different CAD would affect the theoretical BP CFL condition and thus the computational costs. Zhang and Shu only checked, for the 1D $\mathbb P^2$ and $\mathbb P^3$ spaces, that their classic CAD based on the Gauss--Lobatto quadrature is optimal in the sense of achieving the mildest BP CFL conditions. 

### [VindLU: A Recipe for Effective Video-and-Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05051)
The last several years have witnessed remarkable progress in video-and-language (VidL) understanding. However, most modern VidL approaches use complex and specialized model architectures and sophisticated pretraining protocols, making the reproducibility, analysis and comparisons of these frameworks difficult. Hence, instead of proposing yet another new VidL model, this paper conducts a thorough empirical study demystifying the most important factors in the VidL model design. Among the factors that we investigate are (i) the spatiotemporal architecture design, (ii) the multimodal fusion schemes, (iii) the pretraining objectives, (iv) the choice of pretraining data, (v) pretraining and finetuning protocols, and (vi) dataset and model scaling. Our empirical study reveals that the most important design factors include: temporal modeling, video-to-text multimodal fusion, masked modeling objectives, and joint training on images and videos. Using these empirical insights, we then develop a step-by-step recipe, dubbed VindLU, for effective VidL pretraining. Our final model trained using our recipe achieves comparable or better than state-of-the-art results on several VidL tasks without relying on external CLIP pretraining. In particular, on the text-to-video retrieval task, our approach obtains 61.2% on DiDeMo, and 55.0% on ActivityNet, outperforming current SOTA by 7.8% and 6.1% respectively. Furthermore, our model also obtains state-of-the-art video question-answering results on ActivityNet-QA, MSRVTT-QA, MSRVTT-MC and TVQA. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/klauscc/VindLU. 

### [Sparse Upcycling: Training Mixture-of-Experts from Dense Checkpoints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05055)
Training large, deep neural networks to convergence can be prohibitively expensive. As a result, often only a small selection of popular, dense models are reused across different contexts and tasks. Increasingly, sparsely activated models, which seek to decouple model size from computation costs, are becoming an attractive alternative to dense models. Although more efficient in terms of quality and computation cost, sparse models remain data-hungry and costly to train from scratch in the large scale regime. In this work, we propose sparse upcycling -- a simple way to reuse sunk training costs by initializing a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts model from a dense checkpoint. We show that sparsely upcycled T5 Base, Large, and XL language models and Vision Transformer Base and Large models, respectively, significantly outperform their dense counterparts on SuperGLUE and ImageNet, using only ~50% of the initial dense pretraining sunk cost. The upcycled models also outperform sparse models trained from scratch on 100% of the initial dense pretraining computation budget. 

### [Framewise WaveGAN: High Speed Adversarial Vocoder in Time Domain with  Very Low Computational Complexity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04532)
GAN vocoders are currently one of the state-of-the-art methods for building high-quality neural waveform generative models. However, most of their architectures require dozens of billion floating-point operations per second (GFLOPS) to generate speech waveforms in samplewise manner. This makes GAN vocoders still challenging to run on normal CPUs without accelerators or parallel computers. In this work, we propose a new architecture for GAN vocoders that mainly depends on recurrent and fully-connected networks to directly generate the time domain signal in framewise manner. This results in considerable reduction of the computational cost and enables very fast generation on both GPUs and low-complexity CPUs. Experimental results show that our Framewise WaveGAN vocoder achieves significantly higher quality than auto-regressive maximum-likelihood vocoders such as LPCNet at a very low complexity of 1.2 GFLOPS. This makes GAN vocoders more practical on edge and low-power devices. 

### [3D Inception-Based TransMorph: Pre- and Post-operative Multi-contrast  MRI Registration in Brain Tumors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04579)
Deformable image registration is a key task in medical image analysis. The Brain Tumor Sequence Registration challenge (BraTS-Reg) aims at establishing correspondences between pre-operative and follow-up scans of the same patient diagnosed with an adult brain diffuse high-grade glioma and intends to address the challenging task of registering longitudinal data with major tissue appearance changes. In this work, we proposed a two-stage cascaded network based on the Inception and TransMorph models. The dataset for each patient was comprised of a native pre-contrast (T1), a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-CE), a T2-weighted (T2), and a Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). The Inception model was used to fuse the 4 image modalities together and extract the most relevant information. Then, a variant of the TransMorph architecture was adapted to generate the displacement fields. The Loss function was composed of a standard image similarity measure, a diffusion regularizer, and an edge-map similarity measure added to overcome intensity dependence and reinforce correct boundary deformation. We observed that the addition of the Inception module substantially increased the performance of the network. Additionally, performing an initial affine registration before training the model showed improved accuracy in the landmark error measurements between pre and post-operative MRIs. We observed that our best model composed of the Inception and TransMorph architectures while using an initially affine registered dataset had the best performance with a median absolute error of 2.91 (initial error = 7.8). We achieved 6th place at the time of model submission in the final testing phase of the BraTS-Reg challenge. 

### [Effective Dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04580)
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of machine-learning models that use adversarial training to generate new samples with the same (potentially very complex) statistics as the training samples. One major form of training failure, known as mode collapse, involves the generator failing to reproduce the full diversity of modes in the target probability distribution. Here, we present an effective model of GAN training, which captures the learning dynamics by replacing the generator neural network with a collection of particles in the output space; particles are coupled by a universal kernel valid for certain wide neural networks and high-dimensional inputs. The generality of our simplified model allows us to study the conditions under which mode collapse occurs. Indeed, experiments which vary the effective kernel of the generator reveal a mode collapse transition, the shape of which can be related to the type of discriminator through the frequency principle. Further, we find that gradient regularizers of intermediate strengths can optimally yield convergence through critical damping of the generator dynamics. Our effective GAN model thus provides an interpretable physical framework for understanding and improving adversarial training. 

### [Primal Dual Alternating Proximal Gradient Algorithms for Nonsmooth  Nonconvex Minimax Problems with Coupled Linear Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04672)
Nonconvex minimax problems have attracted wide attention in machine learning, signal processing and many other fields in recent years. In this paper, we propose a primal dual alternating proximal gradient (PDAPG) algorithm and a primal dual proximal gradient (PDPG-L) algorithm for solving nonsmooth nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-linear minimax problems with coupled linear constraints, respectively. The corresponding iteration complexity of the two algorithms are proved to be $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-3} \right)$ to reach an $\varepsilon$-stationary point, respectively. To our knowledge, they are the first two algorithms with iteration complexity guarantee for solving the two classes of minimax problems. 

### [ProductGraphSleepNet: Sleep Staging using Product Spatio-Temporal Graph  Learning with Attentive Temporal Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04881)
The classification of sleep stages plays a crucial role in understanding and diagnosing sleep pathophysiology. Sleep stage scoring relies heavily on visual inspection by an expert that is time consuming and subjective procedure. Recently, deep learning neural network approaches have been leveraged to develop a generalized automated sleep staging and account for shifts in distributions that may be caused by inherent inter/intra-subject variability, heterogeneity across datasets, and different recording environments. However, these networks ignore the connections among brain regions, and disregard the sequential connections between temporally adjacent sleep epochs. To address these issues, this work proposes an adaptive product graph learning-based graph convolutional network, named ProductGraphSleepNet, for learning joint spatio-temporal graphs along with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit and a modified graph attention network to capture the attentive dynamics of sleep stage transitions. Evaluation on two public databases: the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) SS3; and the SleepEDF, which contain full night polysomnography recordings of 62 and 20 healthy subjects, respectively, demonstrates performance comparable to the state-of-the-art (Accuracy: 0.867;0.838, F1-score: 0.818;0.774 and Kappa: 0.802;0.775, on each database respectively). More importantly, the proposed network makes it possible for clinicians to comprehend and interpret the learned connectivity graphs for sleep stages. 

### [Deep conv-attention model for diagnosing left bundle branch block from  12-lead electrocardiograms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04936)
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a treatment that is used to compensate for irregularities in the heartbeat. Studies have shown that this treatment is more effective in heart patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) arrhythmia. Therefore, identifying this arrhythmia is an important initial step in determining whether or not to use CRT. On the other hand, traditional methods for detecting LBBB on electrocardiograms (ECG) are often associated with errors. Thus, there is a need for an accurate method to diagnose this arrhythmia from ECG data. Machine learning, as a new field of study, has helped to increase human systems' performance. Deep learning, as a newer subfield of machine learning, has more power to analyze data and increase systems accuracy. This study presents a deep learning model for the detection of LBBB arrhythmia from 12-lead ECG data. This model consists of 1D dilated convolutional layers. Attention mechanism has also been used to identify important input data features and classify inputs more accurately. The proposed model is trained and validated on a database containing 10344 12-lead ECG samples using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The final results obtained by the model on the 12-lead ECG data are as follows. Accuracy: 98.80+-0.08%, specificity: 99.33+-0.11 %, F1 score: 73.97+-1.8%, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC): 0.875+-0.0192. These results indicate that the proposed model in this study can effectively diagnose LBBB with good efficiency and, if used in medical centers, will greatly help diagnose this arrhythmia and early treatment.
