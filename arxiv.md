        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were proposed in the natural language process (NLP) and shows promising results. Recently researchers applied the BERT to source-code representation learning and reported some good news on several downstream tasks. However, in this paper, we illustrated that current methods cannot effectively understand the logic of source codes. The representation of source code heavily relies on the programmer-defined variable and function names. We design and implement a set of experiments to demonstrate our conjecture and provide some insights for future works. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image inpainting is an old problem in computer vision that restores occluded regions and completes damaged images. In the case of facial image inpainting, most of the methods generate only one result for each masked image, even though there are other reasonable possibilities. To prevent any potential biases and unnatural constraints stemming from generating only one image, we propose a novel framework for diverse facial inpainting exploiting the embedding space of StyleGAN. Our framework employs pSp encoder and SeFa algorithm to identify semantic components of the StyleGAN embeddings and feed them into our proposed SPARN decoder that adopts region normalization for plausible inpainting. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Conflict-Based Search is one of the most popular methods for multi-agent path finding. Though it is complete and optimal, it does not scale well. Recent works have been proposed to accelerate it by introducing various heuristics. However, whether these heuristics can apply to non-grid-based problem settings while maintaining their effectiveness remains an open question. In this work, we find that the answer is prone to be no. To this end, we propose a learning-based component, i.e., the Graph Transformer, as a heuristic function to accelerate the planning. The proposed method is provably complete and bounded-suboptimal with any desired factor. We conduct extensive experiments on two environments with dense graphs. Results show that the proposed Graph Transformer can be trained in problem instances with relatively few agents and generalizes well to a larger number of agents, while achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative models make huge progress to the photorealistic image synthesis in recent years. To enable human to steer the image generation process and customize the output, many works explore the interpretable dimensions of the latent space in GANs. Existing methods edit the attributes of the output image such as orientation or color scheme by varying the latent code along certain directions. However, these methods usually require additional human annotations for each pretrained model, and they mostly focus on editing global attributes. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to improve the spatial steerability of GANs without searching for steerable directions in the latent space or requiring extra annotations. Specifically, we design randomly sampled Gaussian heatmaps to be encoded into the intermediate layers of generative models as spatial inductive bias. Along with training the GAN model from scratch, these heatmaps are being aligned with the emerging attention of the GAN's discriminator in a self-supervised learning manner. During inference, human users can intuitively interact with the spatial heatmaps to edit the output image, such as varying the scene layout or moving objects in the scene. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only enables spatial editing over human faces, animal faces, outdoor scenes, and complicated indoor scenes, but also brings improvement in synthesis quality. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The constructed schemes are meant to be of practical use in solving industrial problems and are derived following two related approaches, namely ADER and MUSCL-Hancock. Detailed analysis of linear stability and local truncation error are carried out. In addition, the schemes are implemented and assessed for various test problems.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper the projection hybrid FV/FE method presented in Busto et al. 2014 is extended to account for species transport equations. Furthermore, turbulent regimes are also considered thanks to the $k-\varepsilon$ model. Regarding the transport diffusion stage new schemes of high order of accuracy are developed. The CVC Kolgan-type scheme and ADER methodology are extended to 3D. The latter is modified in order to profit from the dual mesh employed by the projection algorithm and the derivatives involved in the diffusion term are discretized using a Galerkin approach. The accuracy and stability analysis of the new method are carried out for the advection-diffusion-reaction equation. Within the projection stage the pressure correction is computed by a piecewise linear finite element method. Numerical results are presented, aimed at verifying the formal order of accuracy of the scheme and to assess the performance of the method on several realistic test problems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Expert demonstrations are a rich source of supervision for training visual robotic manipulation policies, but imitation learning methods often require either a large number of demonstrations or expensive online expert supervision to learn reactive closed-loop behaviors. In this work, we introduce SPARTN (Synthetic Perturbations for Augmenting Robot Trajectories via NeRF): a fully-offline data augmentation scheme for improving robot policies that use eye-in-hand cameras. Our approach leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to synthetically inject corrective noise into visual demonstrations, using NeRFs to generate perturbed viewpoints while simultaneously calculating the corrective actions. This requires no additional expert supervision or environment interaction, and distills the geometric information in NeRFs into a real-time reactive RGB-only policy. In a simulated 6-DoF visual grasping benchmark, SPARTN improves success rates by 2.8$\times$ over imitation learning without the corrective augmentations and even outperforms some methods that use online supervision. It additionally closes the gap between RGB-only and RGB-D success rates, eliminating the previous need for depth sensors. In real-world 6-DoF robotic grasping experiments from limited human demonstrations, our method improves absolute success rates by $22.5\%$ on average, including objects that are traditionally challenging for depth-based methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Autoregressive models have achieved impressive results over a wide range of domains in terms of generation quality and downstream task performance. In the continuous domain, a key factor behind this success is the usage of quantized latent spaces (e.g., obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders), which allow for dimensionality reduction and faster inference times. However, using existing pre-trained models to perform new non-trivial tasks is difficult since it requires additional fine-tuning or extensive training to elicit prompting. This paper introduces LASS as a way to perform vector-quantized Latent Autoregressive Source Separation (i.e., de-mixing an input signal into its constituent sources) without requiring additional gradient-based optimization or modifications of existing models. Our separation method relies on the Bayesian formulation in which the autoregressive models are the priors, and a discrete (non-parametric) likelihood function is constructed by performing frequency counts over latent sums of addend tokens. We test our method on images and audio with several sampling strategies (e.g., ancestral, beam search) showing competitive results with existing approaches in terms of separation quality while offering at the same time significant speedups in terms of inference time and scalability to higher dimensional data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Integrating human knowledge into neural networks has the potential to improve their robustness and interpretability. We have developed a novel approach to integrate knowledge from ontologies into the structure of a Transformer network which we call ontology pre-training: we train the network to predict membership in ontology classes as a way to embed the structure of the ontology into the network, and subsequently fine-tune the network for the particular prediction task. We apply this approach to a case study in predicting the potential toxicity of a small molecule based on its molecular structure, a challenging task for machine learning in life sciences chemistry. Our approach improves on the state of the art, and moreover has several additional benefits. First, we are able to show that the model learns to focus attention on more meaningful chemical groups when making predictions with ontology pre-training than without, paving a path towards greater robustness and interpretability. Second, the training time is reduced after ontology pre-training, indicating that the model is better placed to learn what matters for toxicity prediction with the ontology pre-training than without. This strategy has general applicability as a neuro-symbolic approach to embed meaningful semantics into neural networks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a new method for producing color images from sketches. Current solutions in sketch colorization either necessitate additional user instruction or are restricted to the "paired" translation strategy. We leverage semantic image segmentation from a general-purpose panoptic segmentation network to generate an additional adversarial loss function. The proposed loss function is compatible with any GAN model. Our method is not restricted to datasets with segmentation labels and can be applied to unpaired translation tasks as well. Using qualitative, and quantitative analysis, and based on a user study, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on four distinct image datasets. On the FID metric, our model improves the baseline by up to 35 points.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Modeling human personality is important for several AI challenges, from the engineering of artificial psychotherapists to the design of persona bots. However, the field of computational personality analysis heavily relies on labeled data, which may be expensive, difficult or impossible to get. This problem is amplified when dealing with rare personality types or disorders (e.g., the anti-social psychopathic personality disorder). In this context, we developed a text-based data augmentation approach for human personality (PEDANT). PEDANT doesn't rely on the common type of labeled data but on the generative pre-trained model (GPT) combined with domain expertise. Testing the methodology on three different datasets, provides results that support the quality of the generated data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Behavioral studies have shown that the memorability of images is similar across groups of people, suggesting that memorability is a function of the intrinsic properties of images, and is unrelated to people's individual experiences and traits. Deep learning networks can be trained on such properties and be used to predict memorability in new data sets. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have pioneered image memorability prediction, but more recently developed vision transformer (ViT) models may have the potential to yield even better predictions. In this paper, we present the ViTMem, a new memorability model based on ViT, and evaluate memorability predictions obtained by it with state-of-the-art CNN-derived models. Results showed that ViTMem performed equal to or better than state-of-the-art models on all data sets. Additional semantic level analyses revealed that ViTMem is particularly sensitive to the semantic content that drives memorability in images. We conclude that ViTMem provides a new step forward, and propose that ViT-derived models can replace CNNs for computational prediction of image memorability. Researchers, educators, advertisers, visual designers and other interested parties can leverage the model to improve the memorability of their image material. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human mobility estimation is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its significant guidance for policymakers to make non-pharmaceutical interventions. While deep learning approaches outperform conventional estimation techniques on tasks with abundant training data, the continuously evolving pandemic poses a significant challenge to solving this problem due to data nonstationarity, limited observations, and complex social contexts. Prior works on mobility estimation either focus on a single city or lack the ability to model the spatio-temporal dependencies across cities and time periods. To address these issues, we make the first attempt to tackle the cross-city human mobility estimation problem through a deep meta-generative framework. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Meta-Generative Adversarial Network (STORM-GAN) model that estimates dynamic human mobility responses under a set of social and policy conditions related to COVID-19. Facilitated by a novel spatio-temporal task-based graph (STTG) embedding, STORM-GAN is capable of learning shared knowledge from a spatio-temporal distribution of estimation tasks and quickly adapting to new cities and time periods with limited training samples. The STTG embedding component is designed to capture the similarities among cities to mitigate cross-task heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed approach can greatly improve estimation performance and out-perform baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: To support software developers in finding and fixing software bugs, several automated program repair techniques have been introduced. Given a test suite, standard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space of software edits to find test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair methods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods, which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still suitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, however, is so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that ChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches, ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the expected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be entered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further increased, fixing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers increasingly dominate the machine learning landscape across many tasks and domains, which increases the importance for understanding their outputs. While their attention modules provide partial insight into their inner workings, the attention scores have been shown to be insufficient for explaining the models as a whole. To address this, we propose B-cos transformers, which inherently provide holistic explanations for their decisions. Specifically, we formulate each model component - such as the multi-layer perceptrons, attention layers, and the tokenisation module - to be dynamic linear, which allows us to faithfully summarise the entire transformer via a single linear transform. We apply our proposed design to Vision Transformers (ViTs) and show that the resulting models, dubbed Bcos-ViTs, are highly interpretable and perform competitively to baseline ViTs on ImageNet. Code will be made available soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer, as an alternative to CNN, has been proven effective in many modalities (e.g., texts and images). For 3D point cloud transformers, existing efforts focus primarily on pushing their accuracy to the state-of-the-art level. However, their latency lags behind sparse convolution-based models (3x slower), hindering their usage in resource-constrained, latency-sensitive applications (such as autonomous driving). This inefficiency comes from point clouds' sparse and irregular nature, whereas transformers are designed for dense, regular workloads. This paper presents FlatFormer to close this latency gap by trading spatial proximity for better computational regularity. We first flatten the point cloud with window-based sorting and partition points into groups of equal sizes rather than windows of equal shapes. This effectively avoids expensive structuring and padding overheads. We then apply self-attention within groups to extract local features, alternate sorting axis to gather features from different directions, and shift windows to exchange features across groups. FlatFormer delivers state-of-the-art accuracy on Waymo Open Dataset with 4.6x speedup over (transformer-based) SST and 1.4x speedup over (sparse convolutional) CenterPoint. This is the first point cloud transformer that achieves real-time performance on edge GPUs and is faster than sparse convolutional methods while achieving on-par or even superior accuracy on large-scale benchmarks. Code to reproduce our results will be made publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, in terms of intensity, texture, shape, size, and location. Comprehensive sets of data and annotations are difficult to acquire. Therefore, unsupervised anomaly detection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training, with the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. Denoising methods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and more recently emerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application of pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. We show that optimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the performance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter adjustments giving good performance for both DAEs and diffusion models. Visual inspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences the trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the extent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly detection performance. We validate our findings on two real-world datasets (tumor detection in brain MRI and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain CT), showing good detection on diverse anomaly appearances. Overall, we find that a DAE trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives state-of-the-art accuracy. Diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as yet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: People all over the globe are affected by pneumonia but deaths due to it are highest in Sub-Saharan Asia and South Asia. In recent years, the overall incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia regardless of the utilization of effective vaccines and compelling antibiotics has escalated. Thus, pneumonia remains a disease that needs spry prevention and treatment. The widespread prevalence of pneumonia has caused the research community to come up with a framework that helps detect, diagnose and analyze diseases accurately and promptly. One of the major hurdles faced by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research community is the lack of publicly available datasets for chest diseases, including pneumonia . Secondly, few of the available datasets are highly imbalanced (normal examples are over sampled, while samples with ailment are in severe minority) making the problem even more challenging. In this article we present a novel framework for the detection of pneumonia. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in the tackling of class imbalance problem. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), specifically a combination of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) was applied on the minority class ``Pneumonia'' for augmentation, whereas Random Under-Sampling (RUS) was done on the majority class ``No Findings'' to deal with the imbalance problem. The ChestX-Ray8 dataset, one of the biggest datasets, is used to validate the performance of the proposed framework. The learning phase is completed using transfer learning on state-of-the-art deep learning models i.e. ResNet-50, Xception, and VGG-16. Results obtained exceed state-of-the-art. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
