### [Moto: Enhancing Embedding with Multiple Joint Factors for Chinese Text  Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08105)
Recently, language representation techniques have achieved great performances in text classification. However, most existing representation models are specifically designed for English materials, which may fail in Chinese because of the huge difference between these two languages. Actually, few existing methods for Chinese text classification process texts at a single level. However, as a special kind of hieroglyphics, radicals of Chinese characters are good semantic carriers. In addition, Pinyin codes carry the semantic of tones, and Wubi reflects the stroke structure information, \textit{etc}. Unfortunately, previous researches neglected to find an effective way to distill the useful parts of these four factors and to fuse them. In our works, we propose a novel model called Moto: Enhancing Embedding with \textbf{M}ultiple J\textbf{o}int Fac\textbf{to}rs. Specifically, we design an attention mechanism to distill the useful parts by fusing the four-level information above more effectively. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular tasks. The empirical results show that our Moto achieves SOTA 0.8316 ($F_1$-score, 2.11\% improvement) on Chinese news titles, 96.38 (1.24\% improvement) on Fudan Corpus and 0.9633 (3.26\% improvement) on THUCNews. 

### [DeepDFA: Dataflow Analysis-Guided Efficient Graph Learning for  Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08108)
Deep learning-based vulnerability detection models have recently been shown to be effective and, in some cases, outperform static analysis tools. However, the highest-performing approaches use token-based transformer models, which do not leverage domain knowledge. Classical program analysis techniques such as dataflow analysis can detect many types of bugs and are the most commonly used methods in practice. Motivated by the causal relationship between bugs and dataflow analysis, we present DeepDFA, a dataflow analysis-guided graph learning framework and embedding that uses program semantic features for vulnerability detection. We show that DeepDFA is performant and efficient. DeepDFA ranked first in recall, first in generalizing over unseen projects, and second in F1 among all the state-of-the-art models we experimented with. It is also the smallest model in terms of the number of parameters, and was trained in 9 minutes, 69x faster than the highest-performing baseline. DeepDFA can be used with other models. By integrating LineVul and DeepDFA, we achieved the best vulnerability detection performance of 96.4 F1 score, 98.69 precision, and 94.22 recall. 

### [Error estimates of a theta-scheme for second-order mean field games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08128)
We introduce and analyze a new finite-difference scheme, relying on the theta-method, for solving monotone second-order mean field games. These games consist of a coupled system of the Fokker-Planck and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The theta-method is used for discretizing the diffusion terms: we approximate them with a convex combination of an implicit and an explicit term. On contrast, we use an explicit centered scheme for the first-order terms. Assuming that the running cost is strongly convex and regular, we first prove the monotonicity and the stability of our theta-scheme, under a CFL condition. Taking advantage of the regularity of the solution of the continuous problem, we estimate the consistency error of the theta-scheme. Our main result is a convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}(h^r)$ for the theta-scheme, where $h$ is the step length of the space variable and $r \in (0,1)$ is related to the H\"older continuity of the solution of the continuous problem and some of its derivatives. 

### [Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08136)
Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\underline{\textbf{S}}$tate s$\underline{\textbf{P}}$ace $\underline{\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\underline{\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\underline{\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. 

### [First De-Trend then Attend: Rethinking Attention for Time-Series  Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08151)
Transformer-based models have gained large popularity and demonstrated promising results in long-term time-series forecasting in recent years. In addition to learning attention in time domain, recent works also explore learning attention in frequency domains (e.g., Fourier domain, wavelet domain), given that seasonal patterns can be better captured in these domains. In this work, we seek to understand the relationships between attention models in different time and frequency domains. Theoretically, we show that attention models in different domains are equivalent under linear conditions (i.e., linear kernel to attention scores). Empirically, we analyze how attention models of different domains show different behaviors through various synthetic experiments with seasonality, trend and noise, with emphasis on the role of softmax operation therein. Both these theoretical and empirical analyses motivate us to propose a new method: TDformer (Trend Decomposition Transformer), that first applies seasonal-trend decomposition, and then additively combines an MLP which predicts the trend component with Fourier attention which predicts the seasonal component to obtain the final prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark time-series forecasting datasets demonstrate that TDformer achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing attention-based models. 

### [MM-SHAP: A Performance-agnostic Metric for Measuring Multimodal  Contributions in Vision and Language Models & Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08158)
Vision and language models (VL) are known to exploit unrobust indicators in individual modalities (e.g., introduced by distributional biases), instead of focusing on relevant information in each modality. A small drop in accuracy obtained on a VL task with a unimodal model suggests that so-called unimodal collapse occurred. But how to quantify the amount of unimodal collapse reliably, at dataset and instance-level, to diagnose and combat unimodal collapse in a targeted way? We present MM-SHAP, a performance-agnostic multimodality score that quantifies the proportion by which a model uses individual modalities in multimodal tasks. MM-SHAP is based on Shapley values and will be applied in two ways: (1) to compare models for their degree of multimodality, and (2) to measure the contribution of individual modalities for a given task and dataset. Experiments with 6 VL models -- LXMERT, CLIP and four ALBEF variants -- on four VL tasks highlight that unimodal collapse can occur to different degrees and in different directions, contradicting the wide-spread assumption that unimodal collapse is one-sided. We recommend MM-SHAP for analysing multimodal tasks, to diagnose and guide progress towards multimodal integration. Code available at: https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/MM-SHAP 

### [LegalRelectra: Mixed-domain Language Modeling for Long-range Legal Text  Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08204)
The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to specialized domains, such as the law, has recently received a surge of interest. As many legal services rely on processing and analyzing large collections of documents, automating such tasks with NLP tools emerges as a key challenge. Many popular language models, such as BERT or RoBERTa, are general-purpose models, which have limitations on processing specialized legal terminology and syntax. In addition, legal documents may contain specialized vocabulary from other domains, such as medical terminology in personal injury text. Here, we propose LegalRelectra, a legal-domain language model that is trained on mixed-domain legal and medical corpora. We show that our model improves over general-domain and single-domain medical and legal language models when processing mixed-domain (personal injury) text. Our training architecture implements the Electra framework, but utilizes Reformer instead of BERT for its generator and discriminator. We show that this improves the model's performance on processing long passages and results in better long-range text comprehension. 

### [SADM: Sequence-Aware Diffusion Model for Longitudinal Medical Image  Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08228)
Human organs constantly undergo anatomical changes due to a complex mix of short-term (e.g., heartbeat) and long-term (e.g., aging) factors. Evidently, prior knowledge of these factors will be beneficial when modeling their future state, i.e., via image generation. However, most of the medical image generation tasks only rely on the input from a single image, thus ignoring the sequential dependency even when longitudinal data is available. Sequence-aware deep generative models, where model input is a sequence of ordered and timestamped images, are still underexplored in the medical imaging domain that is featured by several unique challenges: 1) Sequences with various lengths; 2) Missing data or frame, and 3) High dimensionality. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware diffusion model (SADM) for the generation of longitudinal medical images. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results on high-fidelity image generation. Our method extends this new technique by introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D longitudinal medical images demonstrate the effectiveness of SADM compared with baselines and alternative methods. 

### [H-LPS: a hybrid approach for user's location privacy in location-based  services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08241)
Applications providing location-based services (LBS) have gained much attention and importance with the notion of the internet of things (IoT). Users are utilizing LBS by providing their location information to third-party service providers. However, location data is very sensitive that can reveal user's private life to adversaries. The passive and pervasive data collection in IoT upsurges serious issues of location privacy. Privacy-preserving location-based services are a hot research topic. Many anonymization and obfuscation techniques have been proposed to overcome location privacy issues. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid location privacy scheme (H-LPS), a hybrid scheme mainly based on obfuscation and collaboration for protecting users' location privacy while using location-based services. Obfuscation naturally degrades the quality of service but provides more privacy as compared to anonymization. Our proposed scheme, H-LPS, provides a very high-level of privacy yet provides good accuracy for most of the users. The privacy level and service accuracy of H-LPS are compared with state-of-the-art location privacy schemes and it is shown that H-LPS could be a candidate solution for preserving user location privacy in location-based services. 

### [Learning for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception under Lossy  Communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08273)
Deep learning has been widely used in the perception (e.g., 3D object detection) of intelligent vehicle driving. Due to the beneficial Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, the deep learning based features from other agents can be shared to the ego vehicle so as to improve the perception of the ego vehicle. It is named as Cooperative Perception in the V2V research, whose algorithms have been dramatically advanced recently. However, all the existing cooperative perception algorithms assume the ideal V2V communication without considering the possible lossy shared features because of the Lossy Communication (LC) which is common in the complex real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we first study the side effect (e.g., detection performance drop) by the lossy communication in the V2V Cooperative Perception, and then we propose a novel intermediate LC-aware feature fusion method to relieve the side effect of lossy communication by a LC-aware Repair Network (LCRN) and enhance the interaction between the ego vehicle and other vehicles by a specially designed V2V Attention Module (V2VAM) including intra-vehicle attention of ego vehicle and uncertainty-aware inter-vehicle attention. The extensive experiment on the public cooperative perception dataset OPV2V (based on digital-twin CARLA simulator) demonstrates that the proposed method is quite effective for the cooperative point cloud based 3D object detection under lossy V2V communication. 

### [SceneGATE: Scene-Graph based co-Attention networks for TExt visual  question answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08283)
Most TextVQA approaches focus on the integration of objects, scene texts and question words by a simple transformer encoder. But this fails to capture the semantic relations between different modalities. The paper proposes a Scene Graph based co-Attention Network (SceneGATE) for TextVQA, which reveals the semantic relations among the objects, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tokens and the question words. It is achieved by a TextVQA-based scene graph that discovers the underlying semantics of an image. We created a guided-attention module to capture the intra-modal interplay between the language and the vision as a guidance for inter-modal interactions. To make explicit teaching of the relations between the two modalities, we proposed and integrated two attention modules, namely a scene graph-based semantic relation-aware attention and a positional relation-aware attention. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Text-VQA and ST-VQA. It is shown that our SceneGATE method outperformed existing ones because of the scene graph and its attention modules. 

### [Autoencoders as Cross-Modal Teachers: Can Pretrained 2D Image  Transformers Help 3D Representation Learning?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08320)
The success of deep learning heavily relies on large-scale data with comprehensive labels, which is more expensive and time-consuming to fetch in 3D compared to 2D images or natural languages. This promotes the potential of utilizing models pretrained with data more than 3D as teachers for cross-modal knowledge transferring. In this paper, we revisit masked modeling in a unified fashion of knowledge distillation, and we show that foundational Transformers pretrained with 2D images or natural languages can help self-supervised 3D representation learning through training Autoencoders as Cross-Modal Teachers (ACT). The pretrained Transformers are transferred as cross-modal 3D teachers using discrete variational autoencoding self-supervision, during which the Transformers are frozen with prompt tuning for better knowledge inheritance. The latent features encoded by the 3D teachers are used as the target of masked point modeling, wherein the dark knowledge is distilled to the 3D Transformer students as foundational geometry understanding. Our ACT pretrained 3D learner achieves state-of-the-art generalization capacity across various downstream benchmarks, e.g., 88.21% overall accuracy on ScanObjectNN. Codes will be released at https://github.com/RunpeiDong/ACT. 

### [ReCo: Reliable Causal Chain Reasoning via Structural Causal Recurrent  Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08322)
Causal chain reasoning (CCR) is an essential ability for many decision-making AI systems, which requires the model to build reliable causal chains by connecting causal pairs. However, CCR suffers from two main transitive problems: threshold effect and scene drift. In other words, the causal pairs to be spliced may have a conflicting threshold boundary or scenario. To address these issues, we propose a novel Reliable Causal chain reasoning framework~(ReCo), which introduces exogenous variables to represent the threshold and scene factors of each causal pair within the causal chain, and estimates the threshold and scene contradictions across exogenous variables via structural causal recurrent neural networks~(SRNN). Experiments show that ReCo outperforms a series of strong baselines on both Chinese and English CCR datasets. Moreover, by injecting reliable causal chain knowledge distilled by ReCo, BERT can achieve better performances on four downstream causal-related tasks than BERT models enhanced by other kinds of knowledge. 

### [Mobile Augmented Reality with Federated Learning in the Metaverse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08324)
The Metaverse is deemed the next evolution of the Internet and has received much attention recently. Metaverse applications via mobile augmented reality (MAR) require rapid and accurate object detection to mix digital data with the real world. As mobile devices evolve, they become more potent in computing. Hence, their computational resources can be leveraged to train machine learning models. In light of the increasing concerns of user privacy and data security, federated learning (FL) has become a promising distributed learning framework for privacy-preserving analytics. In this article, FL and MAR are brought together in the Metaverse. We discuss the necessity and rationality of the combination of FL and MAR. The prospective technologies that power FL and MAR in the Metaverse are also identified. In addition, existing challenges that prevent the fulfilment of FL and MAR in the Metaverse and several application scenarios are presented. Finally, two case studies of Metaverse FL-MAR systems are demonstrated. 

### [WavEnhancer: Unifying Wavelet and Transformer for Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08327)
Image enhancement is a technique that frequently utilized in digital image processing. In recent years, the popularity of learning-based techniques for enhancing the aesthetic performance of photographs has increased. However, the majority of current works do not optimize an image from different frequency domains and typically focus on either pixel-level or global-level enhancements. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based model in the wavelet domain to refine different frequency bands of an image. Our method focuses both on local details and high-level features for enhancement, which can generate superior results. On the basis of comprehensive benchmark evaluations, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 

### [MEIL-NeRF: Memory-Efficient Incremental Learning of Neural Radiance  Fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08328)
Hinged on the representation power of neural networks, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as one of the promising and widely applicable methods for 3D object and scene representation. However, NeRF faces challenges in practical applications, such as large-scale scenes and edge devices with a limited amount of memory, where data needs to be processed sequentially. Under such incremental learning scenarios, neural networks are known to suffer catastrophic forgetting: easily forgetting previously seen data after training with new data. We observe that previous incremental learning algorithms are limited by either low performance or memory scalability issues. As such, we develop a Memory-Efficient Incremental Learning algorithm for NeRF (MEIL-NeRF). MEIL-NeRF takes inspiration from NeRF itself in that a neural network can serve as a memory that provides the pixel RGB values, given rays as queries. Upon the motivation, our framework learns which rays to query NeRF to extract previous pixel values. The extracted pixel values are then used to train NeRF in a self-distillation manner to prevent catastrophic forgetting. As a result, MEIL-NeRF demonstrates constant memory consumption and competitive performance. 

### [Convolution-enhanced Evolving Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08330)
Attention-based neural networks, such as Transformers, have become ubiquitous in numerous applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. In all kinds of attention networks, the attention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input tokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning based on representations, wherein the attention maps of different layers are learned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the evolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual convolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the attention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a residual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token relationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an evolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it is beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this process. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced evolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various applications, including time-series representation, natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on time-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated Convolutional (EA-DC-) Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, achieving an average of 17% improvement compared to the best SOTA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly models the layer-wise evolution of attention maps. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/pkuyym/EvolvingAttention 

### [CD-TTA: Compound Domain Test-time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08356)
Test-time adaptation (TTA) has attracted significant attention due to its practical properties which enable the adaptation of a pre-trained model to a new domain with only target dataset during the inference stage. Prior works on TTA assume that the target dataset comes from the same distribution and thus constitutes a single homogeneous domain. In practice, however, the target domain can contain multiple homogeneous domains which are sufficiently distinctive from each other and those multiple domains might occur cyclically. Our preliminary investigation shows that domain-specific TTA outperforms vanilla TTA treating compound domain (CD) as a single one. However, domain labels are not available for CD, which makes domain-specific TTA not practicable. To this end, we propose an online clustering algorithm for finding pseudo-domain labels to obtain similar benefits as domain-specific configuration and accumulating knowledge of cyclic domains effectively. Moreover, we observe that there is a significant discrepancy in terms of prediction quality among samples, especially in the CD context. This further motivates us to boost its performance with gradient denoising by considering the image-wise similarity with the source distribution. Overall, the key contribution of our work lies in proposing a highly significant new task compound domain test-time adaptation (CD-TTA) on semantic segmentation as well as providing a strong baseline to facilitate future works to benchmark. 

### [Generalizing Reduction-Based Algebraic Multigrid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08371)
Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods are often robust and effective solvers for solving the large and sparse linear systems that arise from discretized PDEs and other problems, relying on heuristic graph algorithms to achieve their performance. Reduction-based AMG (AMGr) algorithms attempt to formalize these heuristics by providing two-level convergence bounds that depend concretely on properties of the partitioning of the given matrix into its fine- and coarse-grid degrees of freedom. MacLachlan and Saad (SISC 2007) proved that the AMGr method yields provably robust two-level convergence for symmetric and positive-definite matrices that are diagonally dominant, with a convergence factor bounded as a function of a coarsening parameter. However, when applying AMGr algorithms to matrices that are not diagonally dominant, not only do the convergence factor bounds not hold, but measured performance is notably degraded. Here, we present modifications to the classical AMGr algorithm that improve its performance on matrices that are not diagonally dominant, making use of strength of connection, sparse approximate inverse (SPAI) techniques, and interpolation truncation and rescaling, to improve robustness while maintaining control of the algorithmic costs. We present numerical results demonstrating the robustness of this approach for both classical isotropic diffusion problems and for non-diagonally dominant systems coming from anisotropic diffusion. 

### [GeneFormer: Learned Gene Compression using Transformer-based Context  Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08379)
With the development of gene sequencing technology, an explosive growth of gene data has been witnessed. And the storage of gene data has become an important issue. Traditional gene data compression methods rely on general software like G-zip, which fails to utilize the interrelation of nucleotide sequence. Recently, many researchers begin to investigate deep learning based gene data compression method. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based gene compression method named GeneFormer. Specifically, we first introduce a modified transformer structure to fully explore the nucleotide sequence dependency. Then, we propose fixed-length parallel grouping to accelerate the decoding speed of our autoregressive model. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method saves 29.7% bit rate compared with the state-of-the-art method, and the decoding speed is significantly faster than all existing learning-based gene compression methods. 

### [Homonymy Information for English WordNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08388)
A widely acknowledged shortcoming of WordNet is that it lacks a distinction between word meanings which are systematically related (polysemy), and those which are coincidental (homonymy). Several previous works have attempted to fill this gap, by inferring this information using computational methods. We revisit this task, and exploit recent advances in language modelling to synthesise homonymy annotation for Princeton WordNet. Previous approaches treat the problem using clustering methods; by contrast, our method works by linking WordNet to the Oxford English Dictionary, which contains the information we need. To perform this alignment, we pair definitions based on their proximity in an embedding space produced by a Transformer model. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our best model attains an F1 of .97 on an evaluation set that we annotate. The outcome of our work is a high-quality homonymy annotation layer for Princeton WordNet, which we release. 

### [Reducing Sequence Length Learning Impacts on Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08399)
Classification algorithms using Transformer architectures can be affected by the sequence length learning problem whenever observations from different classes have a different length distribution. This problem brings models to use sequence length as a predictive feature instead of relying on important textual information. Even if most public datasets are not affected by this problem, privately corpora for fields such as medicine and insurance may carry this data bias. This poses challenges throughout the value chain given their usage in a machine learning application. In this paper, we empirically expose this problem and present approaches to minimize its impacts. 

### [Utilizing distilBert transformer model for sentiment classification of  COVID-19's Persian open-text responses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08407)
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused drastic alternations in human life in all aspects. The government's laws in this regard affected the lifestyle of all people. Due to this fact studying the sentiment of individuals is essential to be aware of the future impacts of the coming pandemics. To contribute to this aim, we proposed an NLP (Natural Language Processing) model to analyze open-text answers in a survey in Persian and detect positive and negative feelings of the people in Iran. In this study, a distilBert transformer model was applied to take on this task. We deployed three approaches to perform the comparison, and our best model could gain accuracy: 0.824, Precision: 0.824, Recall: 0.798, and F1 score: 0.804. 

### [Fake it till you make it: Learning(s) from a synthetic ImageNet clone](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08420)
Recent large-scale image generation models such as Stable Diffusion have exhibited an impressive ability to generate fairly realistic images starting from a very simple text prompt. Could such models render real images obsolete for training image prediction models? In this paper, we answer part of this provocative question by questioning the need for real images when training models for ImageNet classification. More precisely, provided only with the class names that have been used to build the dataset, we explore the ability of Stable Diffusion to generate synthetic clones of ImageNet and measure how useful they are for training classification models from scratch. We show that with minimal and class-agnostic prompt engineering those ImageNet clones we denote as ImageNet-SD are able to close a large part of the gap between models produced by synthetic images and models trained with real images for the several standard classification benchmarks that we consider in this study. More importantly, we show that models trained on synthetic images exhibit strong generalization properties and perform on par with models trained on real data. 

### [Free-form 3D Scene Inpainting with Dual-stream GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08464)
Nowadays, the need for user editing in a 3D scene has rapidly increased due to the development of AR and VR technology. However, the existing 3D scene completion task (and datasets) cannot suit the need because the missing regions in scenes are generated by the sensor limitation or object occlusion. Thus, we present a novel task named free-form 3D scene inpainting. Unlike scenes in previous 3D completion datasets preserving most of the main structures and hints of detailed shapes around missing regions, the proposed inpainting dataset, FF-Matterport, contains large and diverse missing regions formed by our free-form 3D mask generation algorithm that can mimic human drawing trajectories in 3D space. Moreover, prior 3D completion methods cannot perform well on this challenging yet practical task, simply interpolating nearby geometry and color context. Thus, a tailored dual-stream GAN method is proposed. First, our dual-stream generator, fusing both geometry and color information, produces distinct semantic boundaries and solves the interpolation issue. To further enhance the details, our lightweight dual-stream discriminator regularizes the geometry and color edges of the predicted scenes to be realistic and sharp. We conducted experiments with the proposed FF-Matterport dataset. Qualitative and quantitative results validate the superiority of our approach over existing scene completion methods and the efficacy of all proposed components. 

### [SteerNeRF: Accelerating NeRF Rendering via Smooth Viewpoint Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08476)
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated superior novel view synthesis performance but are slow at rendering. To speed up the volume rendering process, many acceleration methods have been proposed at the cost of large memory consumption. To push the frontier of the efficiency-memory trade-off, we explore a new perspective to accelerate NeRF rendering, leveraging a key fact that the viewpoint change is usually smooth and continuous in interactive viewpoint control. This allows us to leverage the information of preceding viewpoints to reduce the number of rendered pixels as well as the number of sampled points along the ray of the remaining pixels. In our pipeline, a low-resolution feature map is rendered first by volume rendering, then a lightweight 2D neural renderer is applied to generate the output image at target resolution leveraging the features of preceding and current frames. We show that the proposed method can achieve competitive rendering quality while reducing the rendering time with little memory overhead, enabling 30FPS at 1080P image resolution with a low memory footprint. 

### [Unifying Human Motion Synthesis and Style Transfer with Denoising  Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08526)
Generating realistic motions for digital humans is a core but challenging part of computer animations and games, as human motions are both diverse in content and rich in styles. While the latest deep learning approaches have made significant advancements in this domain, they mostly consider motion synthesis and style manipulation as two separate problems. This is mainly due to the challenge of learning both motion contents that account for the inter-class behaviour and styles that account for the intra-class behaviour effectively in a common representation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model solution for styled motion synthesis. As diffusion models have a high capacity brought by the injection of stochasticity, we can represent both inter-class motion content and intra-class style behaviour in the same latent. This results in an integrated, end-to-end trained pipeline that facilitates the generation of optimal motion and exploration of content-style coupled latent space. To achieve high-quality results, we design a multi-task architecture of diffusion model that strategically generates aspects of human motions for local guidance. We also design adversarial and physical regulations for global guidance. We demonstrate superior performance with quantitative and qualitative results and validate the effectiveness of our multi-task architecture. 

### [Is it Required? Ranking the Skills Required for a Job-Title](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08553)
In this paper, we describe our method for ranking the skills required for a given job title. Our analysis shows that important/relevant skills appear more frequently in similar job titles. We train a Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Encoder (LaBSE) model to predict the importance of the skills using weak supervision. We show the model can learn the importance of skills and perform well in other languages. Furthermore, we show how the Inverse Document Frequency factor of skill boosts the specialised skills. 

### [Rethinking Cooking State Recognition with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08586)
To ensure proper knowledge representation of the kitchen environment, it is vital for kitchen robots to recognize the states of the food items that are being cooked. Although the domain of object detection and recognition has been extensively studied, the task of object state classification has remained relatively unexplored. The high intra-class similarity of ingredients during different states of cooking makes the task even more challenging. Researchers have proposed adopting Deep Learning based strategies in recent times, however, they are yet to achieve high performance. In this study, we utilized the self-attention mechanism of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for the Cooking State Recognition task. The proposed approach encapsulates the globally salient features from images, while also exploiting the weights learned from a larger dataset. This global attention allows the model to withstand the similarities between samples of different cooking objects, while the employment of transfer learning helps to overcome the lack of inductive bias by utilizing pretrained weights. To improve recognition accuracy, several augmentation techniques have been employed as well. Evaluation of our proposed framework on the `Cooking State Recognition Challenge Dataset' has achieved an accuracy of 94.3%, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. 

### [Source Tracing: Detecting Voice Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08601)
Recent anti-spoofing systems focus on spoofing detection, where the task is only to determine whether the test audio is fake. However, there are few studies putting attention to identifying the methods of generating fake speech. Common spoofing attack algorithms in the logical access (LA) scenario, such as voice conversion and speech synthesis, can be divided into several stages: input processing, conversion, waveform generation, etc. In this work, we propose a system for classifying different spoofing attributes, representing characteristics of different modules in the whole pipeline. Classifying attributes for the spoofing attack other than determining the whole spoofing pipeline can make the system more robust when encountering complex combinations of different modules at different stages. In addition, our system can also be used as an auxiliary system for anti-spoofing against unseen spoofing methods. The experiments are conducted on ASVspoof 2019 LA data set and the proposed method achieved a 20\% relative improvement against conventional binary spoof detection methods. 

### [POTATO: The Portable Text Annotation Tool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08620)
We present POTATO, the Portable text annotation tool, a free, fully open-sourced annotation system that 1) supports labeling many types of text and multimodal data; 2) offers easy-to-configure features to maximize the productivity of both deployers and annotators (convenient templates for common ML/NLP tasks, active learning, keypress shortcuts, keyword highlights, tooltips); and 3) supports a high degree of customization (editable UI, inserting pre-screening questions, attention and qualification tests). Experiments over two annotation tasks suggest that POTATO improves labeling speed through its specially-designed productivity features, especially for long documents and complex tasks. POTATO is available at https://github.com/davidjurgens/potato and will continue to be updated. 

### [On Human Visual Contrast Sensitivity and Machine Vision Robustness: A  Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08650)
It is well established in neuroscience that color vision plays an essential part in the human visual perception system. Meanwhile, many novel designs for computer vision inspired by human vision have achieved success in a wide range of tasks and applications. Nonetheless, how color differences affect machine vision has not been well explored. Our work tries to bridge this gap between the human color vision aspect of visual recognition and that of the machine. To achieve this, we curate two datasets: CIFAR10-F and CIFAR100-F, which are based on the foreground colors of the popular CIFAR datasets. Together with CIFAR10-B and CIFAR100-B, the existing counterpart datasets with information on the background colors of CIFAR test sets, we assign each image based on its color contrast level per its foreground and background color labels and use this as a proxy to study how color contrast affects machine vision. We first conduct a proof-of-concept study, showing the effect of color difference and validate our datasets. Furthermore, on a broader level, an important characteristic of human vision is its robustness against ambient changes; therefore, drawing inspirations from ophthalmology and the robustness literature, we analogize contrast sensitivity from the human visual aspect to machine vision and complement the current robustness study using corrupted images with our CIFAR-CoCo datasets. In summary, motivated by neuroscience and equipped with the datasets we curate, we devise a new framework in two dimensions to perform extensive analyses on the effect of color contrast and corrupted images: (1) model architecture, (2) model size, to measure the perception ability of machine vision beyond total accuracy. We also explore how task complexity and data augmentation play a role in this setup. Our results call attention to new evaluation approaches for human-like machine perception. 

### [Attentive Mask CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08653)
Image token removal is an efficient augmentation strategy for reducing the cost of computing image features. However, this efficient augmentation strategy has been found to adversely affect the accuracy of CLIP-based training. We hypothesize that removing a large portion of image tokens may improperly discard the semantic content associated with a given text description, thus constituting an incorrect pairing target in CLIP training. To address this issue, we propose an attentive token removal approach for CLIP training, which retains tokens with a high semantic correlation to the text description. The correlation scores are computed in an online fashion using the EMA version of the visual encoder. Our experiments show that the proposed attentive masking approach performs better than the previous method of random token removal for CLIP training. The approach also makes it efficient to apply multiple augmentation views to the image, as well as introducing instance contrastive learning tasks between these views into the CLIP framework. Compared to other CLIP improvements that combine different pre-training targets such as SLIP and MaskCLIP, our method is not only more effective, but also much more efficient. Specifically, using ViT-B and YFCC-15M dataset, our approach achieves $43.9\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification, as well as $62.7/42.1$ and $38.0/23.2$ I2T/T2I retrieval accuracy on Flickr30K and MS COCO, which are $+1.1\%$, $+5.5/+0.9$, and $+4.4/+1.3$ higher than the SLIP method, while being $2.30\times$ faster. An efficient version of our approach running $1.16\times$ faster than the plain CLIP model achieves significant gains of $+5.3\%$, $+11.3/+8.0$, and $+9.5/+4.9$ on these benchmarks. 

### [Investigation of Japanese PnG BERT language model in text-to-speech  synthesis for pitch accent language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08321)
End-to-end text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) can generate highly natural synthetic speech from raw text. However, rendering the correct pitch accents is still a challenging problem for end-to-end TTS. To tackle the challenge of rendering correct pitch accent in Japanese end-to-end TTS, we adopt PnG~BERT, a self-supervised pretrained model in the character and phoneme domain for TTS. We investigate the effects of features captured by PnG~BERT on Japanese TTS by modifying the fine-tuning condition to determine the conditions helpful inferring pitch accents. We manipulate content of PnG~BERT features from being text-oriented to speech-oriented by changing the number of fine-tuned layers during TTS. In addition, we teach PnG~BERT pitch accent information by fine-tuning with tone prediction as an additional downstream task. Our experimental results show that the features of PnG~BERT captured by pretraining contain information helpful inferring pitch accent, and PnG~BERT outperforms baseline Tacotron on accent correctness in a listening test. 

### [Text-to-speech synthesis based on latent variable conversion using  diffusion probabilistic model and variational autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08329)
Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) is a task to convert texts into speech. Two of the factors that have been driving TTS are the advancements of probabilistic models and latent representation learning. We propose a TTS method based on latent variable conversion using a diffusion probabilistic model and the variational autoencoder (VAE). In our TTS method, we use a waveform model based on VAE, a diffusion model that predicts the distribution of latent variables in the waveform model from texts, and an alignment model that learns alignments between the text and speech latent sequences. Our method integrates diffusion with VAE by modeling both mean and variance parameters with diffusion, where the target distribution is determined by approximation from VAE. This latent variable conversion framework potentially enables us to flexibly incorporate various latent feature extractors. Our experiments show that our method is robust to linguistic labels with poor orthography and alignment errors.
