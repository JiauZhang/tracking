        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) gradually perturb a data distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$ over time by adding noise to it. A neural network is trained to approximate the score $\nabla_\mathbf{x} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ at time $t$, which can be used to reverse the corruption process. In this paper, we focus on learning the score field that is associated with the time evolution according to a physics operator in the presence of natural non-deterministic physical processes like diffusion. A decisive difference to previous methods is that the SDE underlying our approach transforms the state of a physical system to another state at a later time. For that purpose, we replace the drift of the underlying SDE formulation with a differentiable simulator or a neural network approximation of the physics. We propose different training strategies based on the so-called probability flow ODE to fit a training set of simulation trajectories and discuss their relation to the score matching objective. For inference, we sample plausible trajectories that evolve towards a given end state using the reverse-time SDE and demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach for different challenging inverse problems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Humans perceive discrete events such as "restaurant visits" and "train rides" in their continuous experience. One important prerequisite for studying human event perception is the ability of researchers to quantify when one event ends and another begins. Typically, this information is derived by aggregating behavioral annotations from several observers. Here we present an alternative computational approach where event boundaries are derived using a large language model, GPT-3, instead of using human annotations. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can segment continuous narrative text into events. GPT-3-annotated events are significantly correlated with human event annotations. Furthermore, these GPT-derived annotations achieve a good approximation of the "consensus" solution (obtained by averaging across human annotations); the boundaries identified by GPT-3 are closer to the consensus, on average, than boundaries identified by individual human annotators. This finding suggests that GPT-3 provides a feasible solution for automated event annotations, and it demonstrates a further parallel between human cognition and prediction in large language models. In the future, GPT-3 may thereby help to elucidate the principles underlying human event perception. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: BACKGROUND: Recent neural language models have taken a significant step forward in producing remarkably controllable, fluent, and grammatical text. Although some recent works have found that AI-generated text is not distinguishable from human-authored writing for crowd-sourcing workers, there still exist errors in AI-generated text which are even subtler and harder to spot. METHOD: In this paper, we investigate the gap between scientific content generated by AI and written by humans. Specifically, we first adopt several publicly available tools or models to investigate the performance for detecting GPT-generated scientific text. Then we utilize features from writing style to analyze the similarities and differences between the two types of content. Furthermore, more complex and deep perspectives, such as consistency, coherence, language redundancy, and factual errors, are also taken into consideration for in-depth analysis. RESULT: The results suggest that while AI has the potential to generate scientific content that is as accurate as human-written content, there is still a gap in terms of depth and overall quality. AI-generated scientific content is more likely to contain errors in language redundancy and factual issues. CONCLUSION: We find that there exists a ``writing style'' gap between AI-generated scientific text and human-written scientific text. Moreover, based on the analysis result, we summarize a series of model-agnostic or distribution-agnostic features, which could be utilized to unknown or novel domain distribution and different generation methods. Future research should focus on not only improving the capabilities of AI models to produce high-quality content but also examining and addressing ethical and security concerns related to the generation and the use of AI-generated content. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper presents ViDeBERTa, a new pre-trained monolingual language model for Vietnamese, with three versions - ViDeBERTa_xsmall, ViDeBERTa_base, and ViDeBERTa_large, which are pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of high-quality and diverse Vietnamese texts using DeBERTa architecture. Although many successful pre-trained language models based on Transformer have been widely proposed for the English language, there are still few pre-trained models for Vietnamese, a low-resource language, that perform good results on downstream tasks, especially Question answering. We fine-tune and evaluate our model on three important natural language downstream tasks, Part-of-speech tagging, Named-entity recognition, and Question answering. The empirical results demonstrate that ViDeBERTa with far fewer parameters surpasses the previous state-of-the-art models on multiple Vietnamese-specific natural language understanding tasks. Notably, ViDeBERTa_base with 86M parameters, which is only about 23% of PhoBERT_large with 370M parameters, still performs the same or better results than the previous state-of-the-art model.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent work has shown that inducing a large language model (LLM) to generate explanations prior to outputting an answer is an effective strategy to improve performance on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this work, we show that neural rankers also benefit from explanations. We use LLMs such as GPT-3.5 to augment retrieval datasets with explanations and train a sequence-to-sequence ranking model to output a relevance label and an explanation for a given query-document pair. Our model, dubbed ExaRanker, finetuned on a few thousand examples with synthetic explanations performs on par with models finetuned on 3x more examples without explanations. Furthermore, the ExaRanker model incurs no additional computational cost during ranking and allows explanations to be requested on demand. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural retrieval models have acquired significant effectiveness gains over the last few years compared to term-based methods. Nevertheless, those models may be brittle when faced to typos, distribution shifts or vulnerable to malicious attacks. For instance, several recent papers demonstrated that such variations severely impacted models performances, and then tried to train more resilient models. Usual approaches include synonyms replacements or typos injections -- as data-augmentation -- and the use of more robust tokenizers (characterBERT, BPE-dropout). To further complement the literature, we investigate in this paper adversarial training as another possible solution to this robustness issue. Our comparison includes the two main families of BERT-based neural retrievers, i.e. dense and sparse, with and without distillation techniques. We then demonstrate that one of the most simple adversarial training techniques -- the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) -- can improve first stage rankers robustness and effectiveness. In particular, FGSM increases models performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain distributions, and also on queries with typos, for multiple neural retrievers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Precise load forecasting in buildings could increase the bill savings potential and facilitate optimized strategies for power generation planning. With the rapid evolution of computer science, data-driven techniques, in particular the Deep Learning models, have become a promising solution for the load forecasting problem. These models have showed accurate forecasting results; however, they need abundance amount of historical data to maintain the performance. Considering the new buildings and buildings with low resolution measuring equipment, it is difficult to get enough historical data from them, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to adapt Deep Learning models for buildings with limited and scarce data, this paper proposes a Building-to-Building Transfer Learning framework to overcome the problem and enhance the performance of Deep Learning models. The transfer learning approach was applied to a new technique known as Transformer model due to its efficacy in capturing data trends. The performance of the algorithm was tested on a large commercial building with limited data. The result showed that the proposed approach improved the forecasting accuracy by 56.8% compared to the case of conventional deep learning where training from scratch is used. The paper also compared the proposed Transformer model to other sequential deep learning models such as Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The accuracy of the transformer model outperformed other models by reducing the root mean square error to 0.009, compared to LSTM with 0.011 and RNN with 0.051. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recent GAN inversion methods have been able to successfully invert the real image input to the corresponding editable latent code in StyleGAN. By combining with the language-vision model (CLIP), some text-driven image manipulation methods are proposed. However, these methods require extra costs to perform optimization for a certain image or a new attribute editing mode. To achieve a more efficient editing method, we propose a new Text-driven image Manipulation framework via Space Alignment (TMSA). The Space Alignment module aims to align the same semantic regions in CLIP and StyleGAN spaces. Then, the text input can be directly accessed into the StyleGAN space and be used to find the semantic shift according to the text description. The framework can support arbitrary image editing mode without additional cost. Our work provides the user with an interface to control the attributes of a given image according to text input and get the result in real time. Ex tensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance over prior works. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models in the text-to-image domain. This paper studies their application as observation-to-action models for imitating human behaviour in sequential environments. Human behaviour is stochastic and multimodal, with structured correlations between action dimensions. Meanwhile, standard modelling choices in behaviour cloning are limited in their expressiveness and may introduce bias into the cloned policy. We begin by pointing out the limitations of these choices. We then propose that diffusion models are an excellent fit for imitating human behaviour, since they learn an expressive distribution over the joint action space. We introduce several innovations to make diffusion models suitable for sequential environments; designing suitable architectures, investigating the role of guidance, and developing reliable sampling strategies. Experimentally, diffusion models closely match human demonstrations in a simulated robotic control task and a modern 3D gaming environment. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Characterizing neural networks in terms of better-understood formal systems has the potential to yield new insights into the power and limitations of these networks. Doing so for transformers remains an active area of research. Bhattamishra and others have shown that transformer encoders are at least as expressive as a certain kind of counter machine, while Merrill and Sabharwal have shown that fixed-precision transformer encoders recognize only languages in uniform $TC^0$. We connect and strengthen these results by identifying a variant of first-order logic with counting quantifiers that is simultaneously an upper bound for fixed-precision transformer encoders and a lower bound for transformer encoders. This brings us much closer than before to an exact characterization of the languages that transformer encoders recognize. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The vision transformer (ViT) has advanced to the cutting edge in the visual recognition task. Transformers are more robust than CNN, according to the latest research. ViT's self-attention mechanism, according to the claim, makes it more robust than CNN. Even with this, we discover that these conclusions are based on unfair experimental conditions and just comparing a few models, which did not allow us to depict the entire scenario of robustness performance. In this study, we investigate the performance of 58 state-of-the-art computer vision models in a unified training setup based not only on attention and convolution mechanisms but also on neural networks based on a combination of convolution and attention mechanisms, sequence-based model, complementary search, and network-based method. Our research demonstrates that robustness depends on the training setup and model types, and performance varies based on out-of-distribution type. Our research will aid the community in better understanding and benchmarking the robustness of computer vision models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a physics-enhanced implicit neural representation (INR) for ultrasound (US) imaging that learns tissue properties from overlapping US sweeps. Our proposed method leverages a ray-tracing-based neural rendering for novel view US synthesis. Recent publications demonstrated that INR models could encode a representation of a three-dimensional scene from a set of two-dimensional US frames. However, these models fail to consider the view-dependent changes in appearance and geometry intrinsic to US imaging. In our work, we discuss direction-dependent changes in the scene and show that a physics-inspired rendering improves the fidelity of US image synthesis. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally that our proposed method generates geometrically accurate B-mode images for regions with ambiguous representation owing to view-dependent differences of the US images. We conduct our experiments using simulated B-mode US sweeps of the liver and acquired US sweeps of a spine phantom tracked with a robotic arm. The experiments corroborate that our method generates US frames that enable consistent volume compounding from previously unseen views. To the best of our knowledge, the presented work is the first to address view-dependent US image synthesis using INR. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The problem of speech separation, also known as the cocktail party problem, refers to the task of isolating a single speech signal from a mixture of speech signals. Previous work on source separation derived an upper bound for the source separation task in the domain of human speech. This bound is derived for deterministic models. Recent advancements in generative models challenge this bound. We show how the upper bound can be generalized to the case of random generative models. Applying a diffusion model Vocoder that was pretrained to model single-speaker voices on the output of a deterministic separation model leads to state-of-the-art separation results. It is shown that this requires one to combine the output of the separation model with that of the diffusion model. In our method, a linear combination is performed, in the frequency domain, using weights that are inferred by a learned model. We show state-of-the-art results on 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 speakers on multiple benchmarks. In particular, for two speakers, our method is able to surpass what was previously considered the upper performance bound. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
