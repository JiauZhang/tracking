        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In autonomous driving, detection of abnormal driving behaviors is essential to ensure the safety of vehicle controllers. Prior works in vehicle anomaly detection have shown that modeling interactions between agents improves detection accuracy, but certain abnormal behaviors where structured road information is paramount are poorly identified, such as wrong-way and off-road driving. We propose a novel unsupervised framework for highway anomaly detection named Structural Attention-based Recurrent VAE (SABeR-VAE), which explicitly uses the structure of the environment to aid anomaly identification. Specifically, we use a vehicle self-attention module to learn the relations among vehicles on a road, and a separate lane-vehicle attention module to model the importance of permissible lanes to aid in trajectory prediction. Conditioned on the attention modules' outputs, a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture with a stochastic Koopman operator-propagated latent space predicts the next states of vehicles. Our model is trained end-to-end to minimize prediction loss on normal vehicle behaviors, and is deployed to detect anomalies in (ab)normal scenarios. By combining the heterogeneous vehicle and lane information, SABeR-VAE and its deterministic variant, SABeR-AE, improve abnormal AUPR by 18% and 25% respectively on the simulated MAAD highway dataset. Furthermore, we show that the learned Koopman operator in SABeR-VAE enforces interpretable structure in the variational latent space. The results of our method indeed show that modeling environmental factors is essential to detecting a diverse set of anomalies in deployment. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Consistent and holistic expression of software requirements is important for the success of software projects. In this study, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the software development processes by automatically identifying conflicting and duplicate software requirement specifications. We formulate the conflict and duplicate detection problem as a requirement pair classification task. We design a novel transformers-based architecture, SR-BERT, which incorporates Sentence-BERT and Bi-encoders for the conflict and duplicate identification task. Furthermore, we apply supervised multi-stage fine-tuning to the pre-trained transformer models. We test the performance of different transfer models using four different datasets. We find that sequentially trained and fine-tuned transformer models perform well across the datasets with SR-BERT achieving the best performance for larger datasets. We also explore the cross-domain performance of conflict detection models and adopt a rule-based filtering approach to validate the model classifications. Our analysis indicates that the sentence pair classification approach and the proposed transformer-based natural language processing strategies can contribute significantly to achieving automation in conflict and duplicate detection <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Question-and-answer agents like ChatGPT offer a novel tool for use as a potential honeypot interface in cyber security. By imitating Linux, Mac, and Windows terminal commands and providing an interface for TeamViewer, nmap, and ping, it is possible to create a dynamic environment that can adapt to the actions of attackers and provide insight into their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The paper illustrates ten diverse tasks that a conversational agent or large language model might answer appropriately to the effects of command-line attacker. The original result features feasibility studies for ten model tasks meant for defensive teams to mimic expected honeypot interfaces with minimal risks. Ultimately, the usefulness outside of forensic activities stems from whether the dynamic honeypot can extend the time-to-conquer or otherwise delay attacker timelines short of reaching key network assets like databases or confidential information. While ongoing maintenance and monitoring may be required, ChatGPT's ability to detect and deflect malicious activity makes it a valuable option for organizations seeking to enhance their cyber security posture. Future work will focus on cybersecurity layers, including perimeter security, host virus detection, and data security. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Talking head synthesis is a promising approach for the video production industry. Recently, a lot of effort has been devoted in this research area to improve the generation quality or enhance the model generalization. However, there are few works able to address both issues simultaneously, which is essential for practical applications. To this end, in this paper, we turn attention to the emerging powerful Latent Diffusion Models, and model the Talking head generation as an audio-driven temporally coherent denoising process (DiffTalk). More specifically, instead of employing audio signals as the single driving factor, we investigate the control mechanism of the talking face, and incorporate reference face images and landmarks as conditions for personality-aware generalized synthesis. In this way, the proposed DiffTalk is capable of producing high-quality talking head videos in synchronization with the source audio, and more importantly, it can be naturally generalized across different identities without any further fine-tuning. Additionally, our DiffTalk can be gracefully tailored for higher-resolution synthesis with negligible extra computational cost. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DiffTalk efficiently synthesizes high-fidelity audio-driven talking head videos for generalized novel identities.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Incident management for cloud services is a complex process involving several steps and has a huge impact on both service health and developer productivity. On-call engineers require significant amount of domain knowledge and manual effort for root causing and mitigation of production incidents. Recent advances in artificial intelligence has resulted in state-of-the-art large language models like GPT-3.x (both GPT-3.0 and GPT-3.5), which have been used to solve a variety of problems ranging from question answering to text summarization. In this work, we do the first large-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of these models for helping engineers root cause and mitigate production incidents. We do a rigorous study at Microsoft, on more than 40,000 incidents and compare several large language models in zero-shot, fine-tuned and multi-task setting using semantic and lexical metrics. Lastly, our human evaluation with actual incident owners show the efficacy and future potential of using artificial intelligence for resolving cloud incidents. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While speech recognition Word Error Rate (WER) has reached human parity for English, continuous speech recognition scenarios such as voice typing and meeting transcriptions still suffer from segmentation and punctuation problems, resulting from irregular pausing patterns or slow speakers. Transformer sequence tagging models are effective at capturing long bi-directional context, which is crucial for automatic punctuation. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) production systems, however, are constrained by real-time requirements, making it hard to incorporate the right context when making punctuation decisions. Context within the segments produced by ASR decoders can be helpful but limiting in overall punctuation performance for a continuous speech session. In this paper, we propose a streaming approach for punctuation or re-punctuation of ASR output using dynamic decoding windows and measure its impact on punctuation and segmentation accuracy across scenarios. The new system tackles over-segmentation issues, improving segmentation F0.5-score by 13.9%. Streaming punctuation achieves an average BLEUscore improvement of 0.66 for the downstream task of Machine Translation (MT). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers, the de-facto standard for language modeling, have been recently applied for vision tasks. This paper introduces sparse queries for vision transformers to exploit the intrinsic spatial redundancy of natural images and save computational costs. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Grained Encoder for vision transformers, which can adaptively assign a suitable number of queries to each spatial region. Thus it achieves a fine-grained representation in discriminative regions while keeping high efficiency. Besides, the dynamic grained encoder is compatible with most vision transformer frameworks. Without bells and whistles, our encoder allows the state-of-the-art vision transformers to reduce computational complexity by 40%-60% while maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Extensive experiments on object detection and segmentation further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion-based generative models have recently emerged as powerful solutions for high-quality synthesis in multiple domains. Leveraging the bidirectional Markov chains, diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by inferring the reversed Markov chain based on the learned distribution mapping at the forward diffusion process. In this work, we propose Modiff, a conditional paradigm that benefits from the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to tackle the problem of realistic and diverse action-conditioned 3D skeleton-based motion generation. We are a pioneering attempt that uses DDPM to synthesize a variable number of motion sequences conditioned on a categorical action. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale NTU RGB+D dataset and show improvements over state-of-the-art motion generation methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Training machines to understand natural language and interact with humans is one of the major goals of artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed an evolution from matching networks to pre-trained language models (PrLMs). In contrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialogue texts involve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics such as topic transitions and structure dependencies between distant utterances. However, the related PrLM models commonly represent dialogues sequentially by processing the pairwise dialogue history as a whole. Thus the hierarchical information on either utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations is not well addressed. In this work, we propose compositional learning for holistic interaction across the utterances beyond the sequential contextualization from PrLMs, in order to capture the utterance-aware and speaker-aware representations entailed in a dialogue history. We decouple the contextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in Transformer-based PrLM, making each word only focus on the words in current utterance, other utterances, and two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of sender and utterances of the receiver), respectively. In addition, we employ domain-adaptive training strategies to help the model adapt to the dialogue domains. Experimental results show that our method substantially boosts the strong PrLM baselines in four public benchmark datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance over previous methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Advancements in unsupervised machine translation have enabled the development of machine translation systems that can translate between languages for which there is not an abundance of parallel data available. We explored unsupervised machine translation between Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese. Despite the vast number of native speakers of Cantonese, there is still no large-scale corpus for the language, due to the fact that Cantonese is primarily used for oral communication. The key contributions of our project include: 1. The creation of a new corpus containing approximately 1 million Cantonese sentences, and 2. A large-scale comparison across different model architectures, tokenization schemes, and embedding structures. Our best model trained with character-based tokenization and a Transformer architecture achieved a character-level BLEU of 25.1 when translating from Mandarin to Cantonese and of 24.4 when translating from Cantonese to Mandarin. In this paper we discuss our research process, experiments, and results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Healthcare domain generates a lot of unstructured and semi-structured text. Natural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this data. Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The best model achieves 44.1\% mAP on COCO instance segmentation (test-dev 2017), outperforming state-of-the-art box-supervised methods by significant margins. Qualitative results indicate that masks produced by MAL are, in some cases, even better than human annotations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human-Object Interaction (HOI), as an important problem in computer vision, requires locating the human-object pair and identifying the interactive relationships between them. The HOI instance has a greater span in spatial, scale, and task than the individual object instance, making its detection more susceptible to noisy backgrounds. To alleviate the disturbance of noisy backgrounds on HOI detection, it is necessary to consider the input image information to generate fine-grained anchors which are then leveraged to guide the detection of HOI instances. However, it is challenging for the following reasons. i) how to extract pivotal features from the images with complex background information is still an open question. ii) how to semantically align the extracted features and query embeddings is also a difficult issue. In this paper, a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework (FGAHOI) is proposed to alleviate the above problems. FGAHOI comprises three dedicated components namely, multi-scale sampling (MSS), hierarchical spatial-aware merging (HSAM) and task-aware merging mechanism (TAM). MSS extracts features of humans, objects and interaction areas from noisy backgrounds for HOI instances of various scales. HSAM and TAM semantically align and merge the extracted features and query embeddings in the hierarchical spatial and task perspectives in turn. In the meanwhile, a novel training strategy Stage-wise Training Strategy is designed to reduce the training pressure caused by overly complex tasks done by FGAHOI. In addition, we propose two ways to measure the difficulty of HOI detection and a novel dataset, i.e., HOI-SDC for the two challenges (Uneven Distributed Area in Human-Object Pairs and Long Distance Visual Modeling of Human-Object Pairs) of HOI instances detection. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative modeling of 3D brain MRIs presents difficulties in achieving high visual fidelity while ensuring sufficient coverage of the data distribution. In this work, we propose to address this challenge with composable, multiscale morphological transformations in a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. These transformations are applied to a chosen reference brain image to generate MRI volumes, equipping the model with strong anatomical inductive biases. We structure the VAE latent space in a way such that the model covers the data distribution sufficiently well. We show substantial performance improvements in FID while retaining comparable, or superior, reconstruction quality compared to prior work based on VAEs and generative adversarial networks (GANs). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
