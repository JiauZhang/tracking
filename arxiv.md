        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper explores deep latent variable models for semi-supervised paraphrase generation, where the missing target pair is modelled as a latent paraphrase sequence. We present a novel unsupervised model named variational sequence auto-encoding reconstruction (VSAR), which performs latent sequence inference given an observed text. To leverage information from text pairs, we introduce a supervised model named dual directional learning (DDL). Combining VSAR with DDL (DDL+VSAR) enables us to conduct semi-supervised learning; however, the combined model suffers from a cold-start problem. To combat this issue, we propose to deal with better weight initialisation, leading to a two-stage training scheme named knowledge reinforced training. Our empirical evaluations suggest that the combined model yields competitive performance against the state-of-the-art supervised baselines on complete data. Furthermore, in scenarios where only a fraction of the labelled pairs are available, our combined model consistently outperforms the strong supervised model baseline (DDL and Transformer) by a significant margin. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Due to the enormous population growth of cities in recent years, objects are frequently lost and unclaimed on public transportation, in restaurants, or any other public areas. While services like Find My iPhone can easily identify lost electronic devices, more valuable objects cannot be tracked in an intelligent manner, making it impossible for administrators to reclaim a large number of lost and found items in a timely manner. We present a method that significantly reduces the complexity of searching by comparing previous images of lost and recovered things provided by the owner with photos taken when registered lost and found items are received. In this research, we will primarily design a photo matching network by combining the fine-tuning method of MobileNetv2 with CBAM Attention and using the Internet framework to develop an online lost and found image identification system. Our implementation gets a testing accuracy of 96.8% using only 665.12M GLFOPs and 3.5M training parameters. It can recognize practice images and can be run on a regular laptop. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While GPT-2 generates sentences that are remarkably human-like, longer documents can ramble and do not follow human-like writing structure. We study the problem of imposing structure on long-range text. We propose a novel controlled text generation task, sequentially controlled text generation, and identify a dataset, NewsDiscourse as a starting point for this task. We develop a sequential controlled text generation pipeline with generation and editing. We test different degrees of structural awareness and show that, in general, more structural awareness results in higher control-accuracy, grammaticality, coherency and topicality, approaching human-level writing performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep saliency prediction algorithms complement the object recognition features, they typically rely on additional information, such as scene context, semantic relationships, gaze direction, and object dissimilarity. However, none of these models consider the temporal nature of gaze shifts during image observation. We introduce a novel saliency prediction model that learns to output saliency maps in sequential time intervals by exploiting human temporal attention patterns. Our approach locally modulates the saliency predictions by combining the learned temporal maps. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including a multi-duration saliency model, on the SALICON benchmark. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Dense matrix multiply (MM) serves as one of the most heavily used kernels in deep learning applications. To cope with the high computation demands of these applications, heterogeneous architectures featuring both FPGA and dedicated ASIC accelerators have emerged as promising platforms. For example, the AMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture combines general-purpose CPU cores and programmable logic with AI Engine processors optimized for AI/ML. With 400 AIEs, it provides up to 6.4 TFLOPs performance for 32-bit floating-point data. However, machine learning models often contain both large and small MM operations. While large MM operations can be parallelized efficiently across many cores, small MM operations typically cannot. We observe that executing some small MM layers from the BERT natural language processing model on a large, monolithic MM accelerator in Versal ACAP achieved less than 5% of the theoretical peak performance. Therefore, one key question arises: How can we design accelerators to fully use the abundant computation resources under limited communication bandwidth for applications with multiple MM layers of diverse sizes? We identify the biggest system throughput bottleneck resulting from the mismatch of massive computation resources of one monolithic accelerator and the various MM layers of small sizes in the application. To resolve this problem, we propose the CHARM framework to compose multiple diverse MM accelerator architectures working concurrently towards different layers in one application. We deploy the CHARM framework for four different applications, including BERT, ViT, NCF, MLP, on the AMD Versal ACAP VCK190 evaluation board. Our experiments show that we achieve 1.46 TFLOPs, 1.61 TFLOPs, 1.74 TFLOPs, and 2.94 TFLOPs inference throughput for BERT, ViT, NCF and MLP, which obtain 5.40x, 32.51x, 1.00x and 1.00x throughput gains compared to one monolithic accelerator. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D object detection from multi-view images has drawn much attention over the past few years. Existing methods mainly establish 3D representations from multi-view images and adopt a dense detection head for object detection, or employ object queries distributed in 3D space to localize objects. In this paper, we design Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D), which can be equipped with any 2D object detector to promote multi-view 3D object detection. Since 2D detections can provide valuable priors for object existence, MV2D exploits 2D detector to generate object queries conditioned on the rich image semantics. These dynamically generated queries enable MV2D to detect objects in larger 3D space without increased computational costs and shows a strong capability of localizing 3D objects. For the generated queries, we design a sparse cross attention module to force them to focus on the features of specific objects, which reduces the computational cost and suppresses interference from noises. The evaluation results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that dynamic object queries and sparse feature aggregation do not harm 3D detection capability. MV2D also exhibits a state-of-the-art performance among existing methods. We hope MV2D can serve as a new baseline for future research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In the task of generating music, the art factor plays a big role and is a great challenge for AI. Previous work involving adversarial training to produce new music pieces and modeling the compatibility of variety in music (beats, tempo, musical stems) demonstrated great examples of learning this task. Though this was limited to generating mashups or learning features from tempo and key distributions to produce similar patterns. Compound Word Transformer was able to represent music generation task as a sequence generation challenge involving musical events defined by compound words. These musical events give a more accurate description of notes progression, chord change, harmony and the art factor. The objective of the project is to implement a Multi-Genre Transformer which learns to produce music pieces through more adaptive learning process involving more challenging task where genres or form of the composition is also considered. We built a multi-genre compound word dataset, implemented a linear transformer which was trained on this dataset. We call this Multi-Genre Transformer, which was able to generate full length new musical pieces which is diverse and comparable to original tracks. The model trains 2-5 times faster than other models discussed. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Academic success is distributed unequally; a few top scientists receive the bulk of attention, citations, and resources. However, do these ``superstars" foster leadership in scientific innovation? We introduce three information-theoretic measures that quantify novelty, innovation, and impact from scholarly citation networks, and compare the scholarly output of scientists who are either not connected or strongly connected to superstar scientists. We find that while connected scientists do indeed publish more, garner more citations, and produce more diverse content, this comes at a cost of lower innovation and higher redundancy of ideas. Further, once one removes papers co-authored with superstars, the academic output of these connected scientists diminishes. In contrast, authors that produce innovative content without the benefit of collaborations with scientific superstars produce papers that connect a greater diversity of concepts, publish more, and have comparable citation rates, once one controls for transferred prestige of superstars. On balance, our results indicate that academia pays a price by focusing attention and resources on superstars. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The task of Few-shot Learning (FSL) aims to do the inference on novel categories containing only few labeled examples, with the help of knowledge learned from base categories containing abundant labeled training samples. While there are numerous works into FSL task, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have rarely been taken as the backbone to FSL with few trials focusing on naive finetuning of whole backbone or classification layer.} Essentially, despite ViTs have been shown to enjoy comparable or even better performance on other vision tasks, it is still very nontrivial to efficiently finetune the ViTs in real-world FSL scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient Transformer Tuning (eTT) method that facilitates finetuning ViTs in the FSL tasks. The key novelties come from the newly presented Attentive Prefix Tuning (APT) and Domain Residual Adapter (DRA) for the task and backbone tuning, individually. Specifically, in APT, the prefix is projected to new key and value pairs that are attached to each self-attention layer to provide the model with task-specific information. Moreover, we design the DRA in the form of learnable offset vectors to handle the potential domain gaps between base and novel data. To ensure the APT would not deviate from the initial task-specific information much, we further propose a novel prototypical regularization, which maximizes the similarity between the projected distribution of prefix and initial prototypes, regularizing the update procedure. Our method receives outstanding performance on the challenging Meta-Dataset. We conduct extensive experiments to show the efficacy of our model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The paper's goal is to provide a simple unified approach to perform sensitivity analysis using Physics-informed neural networks (PINN). The main idea lies in adding a new term in the loss function that regularizes the solution in a small neighborhood near the nominal value of the parameter of interest. The added term represents the derivative of the residual with respect to the parameter of interest. The result of this modification is a solution to the problem along with the derivative of the solution with respect to the parameter of interest (the sensitivity). We call the new technique to perform sensitivity analysis within this context SA-PINN. We show the effectiveness of the technique using 3 examples: the first one is a simple 1D advection-diffusion problem to show the methodology, the second is a 2D Poisson's problem with 9 parameters of interest and the last one is a transient two-phase flow in porous media problem. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Unsupervised hashing methods have attracted widespread attention with the explosive growth of large-scale data, which can greatly reduce storage and computation by learning compact binary codes. Existing unsupervised hashing methods attempt to exploit the valuable information from samples, which fails to take the local geometric structure of unlabeled samples into consideration. Moreover, hashing based on auto-encoders aims to minimize the reconstruction loss between the input data and binary codes, which ignores the potential consistency and complementarity of multiple sources data. To address the above issues, we propose a hashing algorithm based on auto-encoders for multi-view binary clustering, which dynamically learns affinity graphs with low-rank constraints and adopts collaboratively learning between auto-encoders and affinity graphs to learn a unified binary code, called Graph-Collaborated Auto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE). Specifically, we propose a multi-view affinity graphs learning model with low-rank constraint, which can mine the underlying geometric information from multi-view data. Then, we design an encoder-decoder paradigm to collaborate the multiple affinity graphs, which can learn a unified binary code effectively. Notably, we impose the decorrelation and code balance constraints on binary codes to reduce the quantization errors. Finally, we utilize an alternating iterative optimization scheme to obtain the multi-view clustering results. Extensive experimental results on $5$ public datasets are provided to reveal the effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance over other state-of-the-art alternatives. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D dense captioning aims to generate multiple captions localized with their associated object regions. Existing methods follow a sophisticated ``detect-then-describe'' pipeline equipped with numerous hand-crafted components. However, these hand-crafted components would yield suboptimal performance given cluttered object spatial and class distributions among different scenes. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective transformer framework Vote2Cap-DETR based on recent popular \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer (DETR). Compared with prior arts, our framework has several appealing advantages: 1) Without resorting to numerous hand-crafted components, our method is based on a full transformer encoder-decoder architecture with a learnable vote query driven object decoder, and a caption decoder that produces the dense captions in a set-prediction manner. 2) In contrast to the two-stage scheme, our method can perform detection and captioning in one-stage. 3) Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments on two commonly used datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D, demonstrate that our Vote2Cap-DETR surpasses current state-of-the-arts by 11.13\% and 7.11\% in CIDEr@0.5IoU, respectively.

While the demand prediction problem has been studied extensively, the Origin-Destination (OD) flow prediction of passengers has received less attention from the research community. This paper develops a Graph Neural Network framework along with the Attention Mechanism to predict the OD flow of passengers. The proposed framework exploits various linear and non-linear dependencies that arise among requests originating from different locations and captures the repetition pattern and the contextual data of that place. Moreover, the optimal size of the grid cell that covers the road network and preserves the complexity and accuracy of the model is determined. Extensive simulations are conducted to examine the characteristics of our proposed approach and its various components. The results show the superior performance of our proposed model compared to the existing baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: It is difficult to train classifiers on paintings collections due to model bias from domain gaps and data bias from the uneven distribution of artistic styles. Previous techniques like data distillation, traditional data augmentation and style transfer improve classifier training using task specific training datasets or domain adaptation. We propose a system to handle data bias in small paintings datasets like the Kaokore dataset while simultaneously accounting for domain adaptation in fine-tuning a model trained on real world images. Our system consists of two stages which are style transfer and classification. In the style transfer stage, we generate the stylized training samples per class with uniformly sampled content and style images and train the style transformation network per domain. In the classification stage, we can interpret the effectiveness of the style and content layers at the attention layers when training on the original training dataset and the stylized images. We can tradeoff the model performance and convergence by dynamically varying the proportion of augmented samples in the majority and minority classes. We achieve comparable results to the SOTA with fewer training epochs and a classifier with fewer training parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With recent developments in digitization of clinical psychology, NLP research community has revolutionized the field of mental health detection on social media. Existing research in mental health analysis revolves around the cross-sectional studies to classify users' intent on social media. For in-depth analysis, we investigate existing classifiers to solve the problem of causal categorization which suggests the inefficiency of learning based methods due to limited training samples. To handle this challenge, we use transformer models and demonstrate the efficacy of a pre-trained transfer learning on "CAMS" dataset. The experimental result improves the accuracy and depicts the importance of identifying cause-and-effect relationships in the underlying text. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Feedback connections play a prominent role in the human brain but have not received much attention in artificial neural network research. Here, a biologically inspired feedback mechanism which gates rectified linear units is proposed. On the MNIST dataset, autoencoders with feedback show faster convergence, better performance, and more robustness to noise compared to their counterparts without feedback. Some benefits, although less pronounced and less consistent, can be observed when networks with feedback are applied on the CIFAR-10 dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the development of artificial intelligence technology, Federated Learning (FL) model has been widely used in many industries for its high efficiency and confidentiality. Some researchers have explored its confidentiality and designed some algorithms to attack training data sets, but these algorithms all have their own limitations. Therefore, most people still believe that local machine learning gradient information is safe and reliable. In this paper, an algorithm based on gradient features is designed to attack the federated learning model in order to attract more attention to the security of federated learning systems. In federated learning system, gradient contains little information compared with the original training data set, but this project intends to restore the original training image data through gradient information. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has excellent performance in image processing. Therefore, the federated learning model of this project is equipped with Convolutional Neural Network structure, and the model is trained by using image data sets. The algorithm calculates the virtual gradient by generating virtual image labels. Then the virtual gradient is matched with the real gradient to restore the original image. This attack algorithm is written in Python language, uses cat and dog classification Kaggle data sets, and gradually extends from the full connection layer to the convolution layer, thus improving the universality. At present, the average squared error between the data recovered by this algorithm and the original image information is approximately 5, and the vast majority of images can be completely restored according to the gradient information given, indicating that the gradient of federated learning system is not absolutely safe and reliable. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers as versatile network architectures have recently seen great success in 3D point cloud object detection. However, the lack of hierarchy in a plain transformer makes it difficult to learn features at different scales and restrains its ability to extract localized features. Such limitation makes them have imbalanced performance on objects of different sizes, with inferior performance on smaller ones. In this work, we propose two novel attention mechanisms as modularized hierarchical designs for transformer-based 3D detectors. To enable feature learning at different scales, we propose Simple Multi-Scale Attention that builds multi-scale tokens from a single-scale input feature. For localized feature aggregation, we propose Size-Adaptive Local Attention with adaptive attention ranges for every bounding box proposal. Both of our attention modules are model-agnostic network layers that can be plugged into existing point cloud transformers for end-to-end training. We evaluate our method on two widely used indoor 3D point cloud object detection benchmarks. By plugging our proposed modules into the state-of-the-art transformer-based 3D detector, we improve the previous best results on both benchmarks, with the largest improvement margin on small objects. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale Transformer models are known for their exceptional performance in a range of tasks, but training them can be difficult due to the requirement for communication-intensive model parallelism. One way to improve training speed is to compress the message size in communication. Previous approaches have primarily focused on compressing gradients in a data parallelism setting, but compression in a model-parallel setting is an understudied area. We have discovered that model parallelism has fundamentally different characteristics than data parallelism. In this work, we present the first empirical study on the effectiveness of compression methods for model parallelism. We implement and evaluate three common classes of compression algorithms - pruning-based, learning-based, and quantization-based - using a popular Transformer training framework. We evaluate these methods across more than 160 settings and 8 popular datasets, taking into account different hyperparameters, hardware, and both fine-tuning and pre-training stages. We also provide analysis when the model is scaled up. Finally, we provide insights for future development of model parallelism compression algorithms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper proposes singing voice synthesis (SVS) based on frame-level sequence-to-sequence models considering vocal timing deviation. In SVS, it is essential to synchronize the timing of singing with temporal structures represented by scores, taking into account that there are differences between actual vocal timing and note start timing. In many SVS systems including our previous work, phoneme-level score features are converted into frame-level ones on the basis of phoneme boundaries obtained by external aligners to take into account vocal timing deviations. Therefore, the sound quality is affected by the aligner accuracy in this system. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an attention mechanism with frame-level features. In the proposed system, the attention mechanism absorbs alignment errors in phoneme boundaries. Additionally, we evaluate the system with pseudo-phoneme-boundaries defined by heuristic rules based on musical scores when there is no aligner. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed system. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In medical practice, the contribution of information technology can be considerable. Most of these practices include the images that medical assistance uses to identify different pathologies of the human body. One of them is X-ray images which cover much of our work in this paper. Chest x-rays have played an important role in Covid 19 identification and diagnosis. The Covid 19 virus has been declared a global pandemic since 2020 after the first case found in Wuhan China in December 2019. Our goal in this project is to be able to classify different chest X-ray images containing Covid 19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity and normal images. We used CNN architecture and different pre-trained models. The best result is obtained by the use of the ResNet 18 architecture with 94.1% accuracy. We also note that The GPU execution time is optimal in the case of AlexNet but what requires our attention is that the pretrained models converge much faster than the CNN. The time saving is very considerable. With these results not only will solve the diagnosis time for patients, but will provide an interesting tool for practitioners, thus helping them in times of strong pandemic in particular. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: To solve the problems of reduced accuracy and prolonging convergence time of through-the-wall radar (TWR) human motion due to wall attenuation, multipath effect, and system interference, we propose a multilink auto-encoding neural network (TWR-MCAE) data augmentation method. Specifically, the TWR-MCAE algorithm is jointly constructed by a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based data preprocessing module, an improved coordinate attention module, a compressed sensing learnable iterative shrinkage threshold reconstruction algorithm (LISTA) module, and an adaptive weight module. The data preprocessing module achieves wall clutter, human motion features, and noise subspaces separation. The improved coordinate attention module achieves clutter and noise suppression. The LISTA module achieves human motion feature enhancement. The adaptive weight module learns the weights and fuses the three subspaces. The TWR-MCAE can suppress the low-rank characteristics of wall clutter and enhance the sparsity characteristics in human motion at the same time. It can be linked before the classification step to improve the feature extraction capability without adding other prior knowledge or recollecting more data. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm gets a better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which increases the recognition accuracy and speeds up the training process of the back-end classifiers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning (DL) applied to breast tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has received increased attention in the last decade, however, the domain shift which arises from different vendors, acquisition protocols, and biological heterogeneity, remains an important but challenging obstacle on the path towards clinical implementation. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by incorporating self-training with contrastive learning. To better exploit the underlying semantic information of the image at different levels, we propose a Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrastive Domain Adaptation (MSCDA) framework to align the feature representation between domains. In particular, we extend the contrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and centroid-to-centroid contrasts to integrate semantic information of images. We utilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from target images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source images. Two breast MRI datasets were retrospectively collected: The source dataset contains non-contrast MRI examinations from 11 healthy volunteers and the target dataset contains contrast-enhanced MRI examinations of 134 invasive breast cancer patients. We set up experiments from source T2W image to target dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1W image (T2W-to-T1W) and from source T1W image to target T2W image (T1W-to-T2W). The proposed method achieved Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.2\% and 84.0\% in T2W-to-T1W and T1W-to-T2W, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, good performance is still achieved with a smaller source dataset, proving that our framework is label-efficient. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Applying new computing paradigms like quantum computing to the field of machine learning has recently gained attention. However, as high-dimensional real-world applications are not yet feasible to be solved using purely quantum hardware, hybrid methods using both classical and quantum machine learning paradigms have been proposed. For instance, transfer learning methods have been shown to be successfully applicable to hybrid image classification tasks. Nevertheless, beneficial circuit architectures still need to be explored. Therefore, tracing the impact of the chosen circuit architecture and parameterization is crucial for the development of beneficially applicable hybrid methods. However, current methods include processes where both parts are trained concurrently, therefore not allowing for a strict separability of classical and quantum impact. Thus, those architectures might produce models that yield a superior prediction accuracy whilst employing the least possible quantum impact. To tackle this issue, we propose Sequential Quantum Enhanced Training (SEQUENT) an improved architecture and training process for the traceable application of quantum computing methods to hybrid machine learning. Furthermore, we provide formal evidence for the disadvantage of current methods and preliminary experimental results as a proof-of-concept for the applicability of SEQUENT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
