        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Vision transformer (ViT) is an attention neural network architecture that is shown to be effective for computer vision tasks. However, compared to ResNet-18 with a similar number of parameters, ViT has a significantly lower evaluation accuracy when trained on small datasets. To facilitate studies in related fields, we provide a visual intuition to help understand why it is the case. We first compare the performance of the two models and confirm that ViT has less accuracy than ResNet-18 when trained on small datasets. We then interpret the results by showing attention map visualization for ViT and feature map visualization for ResNet-18. The difference is further analyzed through a representation similarity perspective. We conclude that the representation of ViT trained on small datasets is hugely different from ViT trained on large datasets, which may be the reason why the performance drops a lot on small datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in the area of long document matching have primarily focused on using transformer-based models for long document encoding and matching. There are two primary challenges associated with these models. Firstly, the performance gain provided by transformer-based models comes at a steep cost - both in terms of the required training time and the resource (memory and energy) consumption. The second major limitation is their inability to handle more than a pre-defined input token length at a time. In this work, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of simple neural models (such as feed-forward networks, and CNNs) and simple embeddings (like GloVe, and Paragraph Vector) over transformer-based models on the task of document matching. We show that simple models outperform the more complex BERT-based models while taking significantly less training time, energy, and memory. The simple models are also more robust to variations in document length and text perturbations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Auto-regressive large language models such as GPT-3 require enormous computational resources to use. Traditionally, structured pruning methods are employed to reduce resource usage. However, their application to and efficacy for generative language models is heavily under-explored. In this paper we conduct an comprehensive evaluation of common structured pruning methods, including magnitude, random, and movement pruning on the feed-forward layers in GPT-type models. Unexpectedly, random pruning results in performance that is comparable to the best established methods, across multiple natural language generation tasks. To understand these results, we provide a framework for measuring neuron-level redundancy of models pruned by different methods, and discover that established structured pruning methods do not take into account the distinctiveness of neurons, leaving behind excess redundancies. In view of this, we introduce Globally Unique Movement (GUM) to improve the uniqueness of neurons in pruned models. We then discuss the effects of our techniques on different redundancy metrics to explain the improved performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Humans understand language by extracting information (meaning) from sentences, combining it with existing commonsense knowledge, and then performing reasoning to draw conclusions. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT are able to leverage patterns in the text to solve a variety of NLP tasks, they fall short in problems that require reasoning. They also cannot reliably explain the answers generated for a given question. In order to emulate humans better, we propose STAR, a framework that combines LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show how LLMs can be used to effectively extract knowledge -- represented as predicates -- from language. Goal-directed ASP is then employed to reliably reason over this knowledge. We apply the STAR framework to three different NLU tasks requiring reasoning: qualitative reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and goal-directed conversation. Our experiments reveal that STAR is able to bridge the gap of reasoning in NLU tasks, leading to significant performance improvements, especially for smaller LLMs, i.e., LLMs with a smaller number of parameters. NLU applications developed using the STAR framework are also explainable: along with the predicates generated, a justification in the form of a proof tree can be produced for a given output. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural networks (NNs) have proven to be a viable alternative to traditional direct numerical algorithms, with the potential to accelerate computational time by several orders of magnitude. In the present paper we study the use of encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) as surrogates for steady-state diffusion solvers. The construction of such surrogates requires the selection of an appropriate task, network architecture, training set structure and size, loss function, and training algorithm hyperparameters. It is well known that each of these factors can have a significant impact on the performance of the resultant model. Our approach employs an encoder-decoder CNN architecture, which we posit is particularly well-suited for this task due to its ability to effectively transform data, as opposed to merely compressing it. We systematically evaluate a range of loss functions, hyperparameters, and training set sizes. Our results indicate that increasing the size of the training set has a substantial effect on reducing performance fluctuations and overall error. Additionally, we observe that the performance of the model exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the training set size. Furthermore, we investigate the effect on model performance by using different subsets of data with varying features. Our results highlight the importance of sampling the configurational space in an optimal manner, as this can have a significant impact on the performance of the model and the required training time. In conclusion, our results suggest that training a model with a pre-determined error performance bound is not a viable approach, as it does not guarantee that edge cases with errors larger than the bound do not exist. Furthermore, as most surrogate tasks involve a high dimensional landscape, an ever increasing training set size is, in principle, needed, however it is not a practical solution. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic objects and have been successfully applied to images, text, and videos. Recent work has shown that diffusion can also be defined on graphs, including graph representations of drug-like molecules. Unfortunately, it remains difficult to perform conditional generation on graphs in a way which is interpretable and controllable. In this work, we propose GraphGUIDE, a novel framework for graph generation using diffusion models, where edges in the graph are flipped or set at each discrete time step. We demonstrate GraphGUIDE on several graph datasets, and show that it enables full control over the conditional generation of arbitrary structural properties without relying on predefined labels. Our framework for graph diffusion can have a large impact on the interpretable conditional generation of graphs, including the generation of drug-like molecules with desired properties in a way which is informed by experimental evidence. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising diffusion models have spurred significant gains in density modeling and image generation, precipitating an industrial revolution in text-guided AI art generation. We introduce a new mathematical foundation for diffusion models inspired by classic results in information theory that connect Information with Minimum Mean Square Error regression, the so-called I-MMSE relations. We generalize the I-MMSE relations to exactly relate the data distribution to an optimal denoising regression problem, leading to an elegant refinement of existing diffusion bounds. This new insight leads to several improvements for probability distribution estimation, including theoretical justification for diffusion model ensembling. Remarkably, our framework shows how continuous and discrete probabilities can be learned with the same regression objective, avoiding domain-specific generative models used in variational methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A neural artistic style transformation (NST) model can modify the appearance of a simple image by adding the style of a famous image. Even though the transformed images do not look precisely like artworks by the same artist of the respective style images, the generated images are appealing. Generally, a trained NST model specialises in a style, and a single image represents that style. However, generating an image under a new style is a tedious process, which includes full model training. In this paper, we present two methods that step toward the style image independent neural style transfer model. In other words, the trained model could generate semantically accurate generated image under any content, style image input pair. Our novel contribution is a unidirectional-GAN model that ensures the Cyclic consistency by the model architecture.Furthermore, this leads to much smaller model size and an efficient training and validation phase. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pre-trained models have been used in many fields in recent years, ranging from natural language understanding to computer vision and natural language generation. However, the performance of these natural language generation models is overly dependent on the scale of the model and the size of the dataset. While the larger language model is excellent in some respects, it cannot learn up-to-date knowledge and is relatively difficult to relearn. In this paper, a new adversarial process learning method called Auto-Learning. This can improve the performance of any natural language generation model without the help of additional datasets. Auto-Learning includes two models: $G$ is a text generation model and $D$ can test whether the data generated by G is legitimate. Firstly, the fine-tuned $D$ model is used as the brain's knowledge base before the process. Then the text generated by the $G$ model is used as the input of $D$ to determine whether the text is legitimate or not. Finally, $G$ is fine-tuned according to the output of $D$. This adversarial process is like a self-escalation of the brain through some a priori knowledge. When this adversarial system wants to learn something new, simply fine-tune the $D$ model. Our approach applies to Autoregressive Language Modeling for all Transformer classes. The results are good in existing experimental tasks, including more grammatical text generation and better performance on some text comprehension tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advancements in large scale text-to-image models have opened new possibilities for guiding the creation of images through human-devised natural language. However, while prior literature has primarily focused on the generation of individual images, it is essential to consider the capability of these models to ensure coherency within a sequence of images to fulfill the demands of real-world applications such as storytelling. To address this, here we present a novel neural pipeline for generating a coherent storybook from the plain text of a story. Specifically, we leverage a combination of a pre-trained Large Language Model and a text-guided Latent Diffusion Model to generate coherent images. While previous story synthesis frameworks typically require a large-scale text-to-image model trained on expensive image-caption pairs to maintain the coherency, we employ simple textual inversion techniques along with detector-based semantic image editing which allows zero-shot generation of the coherent storybook. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image editing baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce Noise2Music, where a series of diffusion models is trained to generate high-quality 30-second music clips from text prompts. Two types of diffusion models, a generator model, which generates an intermediate representation conditioned on text, and a cascader model, which generates high-fidelity audio conditioned on the intermediate representation and possibly the text, are trained and utilized in succession to generate high-fidelity music. We explore two options for the intermediate representation, one using a spectrogram and the other using audio with lower fidelity. We find that the generated audio is not only able to faithfully reflect key elements of the text prompt such as genre, tempo, instruments, mood, and era, but goes beyond to ground fine-grained semantics of the prompt. Pretrained large language models play a key role in this story -- they are used to generate paired text for the audio of the training set and to extract embeddings of the text prompts ingested by the diffusion models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Accurate user interest modeling is vital for recommendation scenarios. One of the effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click behaviors, but this is not elegant in the video feed recommendation where users are passive in receiving the streaming contents and return skip or no-skip behaviors instead of active click behavior. Here skip and no-skip behaviors can be treated as negative and positive feedback, respectively. Indeed, skip and no-skip are not simply positive or negative correlated, so it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of positive and negative feedback. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer and grouped each feedback into different Transformers. Indeed, such a task may be challenging for the vanilla Transformer because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not consider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest Factorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR) consisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer and prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose each head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations. Then we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific head interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the relation between different types of feedback. Additionally, we propose a dual-interest disentangling layer to decouple positive and negative interests before performing disentanglement on their representations. Finally, we evolve the positive and negative interests by corresponding towers whose outputs are contrastive by BPR loss. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation study and visualization also sustain its effectiveness. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A wide variety of orthographic coding schemes and models of visual word identification have been developed to account for masked priming data that provide a measure of orthographic similarity between letter strings. These models tend to include hand-coded orthographic representations with single unit coding for specific forms of knowledge (e.g., units coding for a letter in a given position or a letter sequence). Here we assess how well a range of these coding schemes and models account for the pattern of form priming effects taken from the Form Priming Project and compare these findings to results observed in with 11 standard deep neural network models (DNNs) developed in computer science. We find that deep convolutional networks perform as well or better than the coding schemes and word recognition models, whereas transformer networks did less well. The success of convolutional networks is remarkable as their architectures were not developed to support word recognition (they were designed to perform well on object recognition) and they classify pixel images of words (rather artificial encodings of letter strings). The findings add to the recent work of (Hannagan et al., 2021) suggesting that convolutional networks may capture key aspects of visual word identification. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 64.33% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn "prompt engineering" fashion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent transformer language models achieve outstanding results in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their enormous size often makes them impractical on memory-constrained devices, requiring practitioners to compress them to smaller networks. In this paper, we explore offline compression methods, meaning computationally-cheap approaches that do not require further fine-tuning of the compressed model. We challenge the classical matrix factorization methods by proposing a novel, better-performing autoencoder-based framework. We perform a comprehensive ablation study of our approach, examining its different aspects over a diverse set of evaluation settings. Moreover, we show that enabling collaboration between modules across layers by compressing certain modules together positively impacts the final model performance. Experiments on various NLP tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms commonly used factorization-based offline compression methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many tasks in video analysis and understanding boil down to the need for frame-based feature learning, aiming to encapsulate the relevant visual content so as to enable simpler and easier subsequent processing. While supervised strategies for this learning task can be envisioned, self and weakly-supervised alternatives are preferred due to the difficulties in getting labeled data. This paper introduces LRProp -- a novel weakly-supervised representation learning approach, with an emphasis on the application of temporal alignment between pairs of videos of the same action category. The proposed approach uses a transformer encoder for extracting frame-level features, and employs the DTW algorithm within the training iterations in order to identify the alignment path between video pairs. Through a process referred to as ``pair-wise position propagation'', the probability distributions of these correspondences per location are matched with the similarity of the frame-level features via KL-divergence minimization. The proposed algorithm uses also a regularized SoftDTW loss for better tuning the learned features. Our novel representation learning paradigm consistently outperforms the state of the art on temporal alignment tasks, establishing a new performance bar over several downstream video analysis applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The breakthrough performance of large language models (LLMs) comes with large computational footprints and high deployment costs. In this paper, we progress towards resolving this problem by proposing a new structured compression approach for LLMs, called ZipLM, which provides state-of-the-art compression-vs-accuracy results, while guaranteeing to match a set of (achievable) target speedups on any given target hardware. Specifically, given a task, a model, an inference environment, as well as a set of speedup targets, ZipLM identifies and removes redundancies in the model through iterative structured shrinking of the model's weight matrices. Importantly, ZipLM works in both, the post-training/one-shot and the gradual compression setting, where it produces a set of accurate models in a single run, making it highly-efficient in practice. Our approach is based on new structured pruning and knowledge distillation techniques, and consistently outperforms prior structured compression methods in terms of accuracy-versus-speedup in experiments on BERT- and GPT-family models. In particular, when compressing GPT2 model, it outperforms DistilGPT2 while being 60% smaller and 30% faster. Further, ZipLM matches performance of heavily optimized MobileBERT model, obtained via extensive architecture search, by simply pruning the baseline BERT-large architecture, and outperforms all prior BERT-base compression techniques like CoFi, MiniLM and TinyBERT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Although BERT-based ranking models have been commonly used in commercial search engines, they are usually time-consuming for online ranking tasks. Knowledge distillation, which aims at learning a smaller model with comparable performance to a larger model, is a common strategy for reducing the online inference latency. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different loss functions for uniform-architecture distillation of BERT-based ranking models. Here "uniform-architecture" denotes that both teacher and student models are in cross-encoder architecture, while the student models include small-scaled pre-trained language models. Our experimental results reveal that the optimal distillation configuration for ranking tasks is much different than general natural language processing tasks. Specifically, when the student models are in cross-encoder architecture, a pairwise loss of hard labels is critical for training student models, whereas the distillation objectives of intermediate Transformer layers may hurt performance. These findings emphasize the necessity of carefully designing a distillation strategy (for cross-encoder student models) tailored for document ranking with pairwise training samples. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

However, performance of networks trained with synthetic data for certain computer vision tasks degrade significantly when tested on real world data due to the domain gap between them.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent neural network-based wave functions have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in modeling ab-initio ground-state potential energy surface. However, these networks can only solve different spatial arrangements of the same set of atoms. To overcome this limitation, we present Graph-learned Orbital Embeddings (Globe), a neural network-based reparametrization method that can adapt neural wave functions to different molecules. We achieve this by combining a localization method for molecular orbitals with spatial message-passing networks. Further, we propose a locality-driven wave function, the Molecular Oribtal Network (Moon), tailored to solving Schr\"odinger equations of different molecules jointly. In our experiments, we find Moon requiring 8 times fewer steps to converge to similar accuracies as previous methods when trained on different molecules jointly while Globe enabling the transfer from smaller to larger molecules. Further, our analysis shows that Moon converges similarly to recent transformer-based wave functions on larger molecules. In both the computational chemistry and machine learning literature, we are the first to demonstrate that a single wave function can solve the Schr\"odinger equation of molecules with different atoms jointly. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, transformer architectures for graphs emerged as an alternative to established techniques for machine learning with graphs, such as graph neural networks. So far, they have shown promising empirical results, e.g., on molecular prediction datasets, often attributed to their ability to circumvent graph neural networks' shortcomings, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs. Empirically, we probe how well graph transformers can recover various graph properties, how well they can deal with heterophilic graphs, and to what extent they prevent over-squashing. Further, we outline open challenges and research direction to stimulate future work.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Current approaches for clinical information extraction are inefficient in terms of computational costs and memory consumption, hindering their application to process large-scale electronic health records (EHRs). We propose an efficient end-to-end model, the Joint-NER-RE-Fourier (JNRF), to jointly learn the tasks of named entity recognition and relation extraction for documents of variable length. The architecture uses positional encoding and unitary batch sizes to process variable length documents and uses a weight-shared Fourier network layer for low-complexity token mixing. Finally, we reach the theoretical computational complexity lower bound for relation extraction using a selective pooling strategy and distance-aware attention weights with trainable polynomial distance functions. We evaluated the JNRF architecture using the 2018 N2C2 ADE benchmark to jointly extract medication-related entities and relations in variable-length EHR summaries. JNRF outperforms rolling window BERT with selective pooling by 0.42%, while being twice as fast to train. Compared to state-of-the-art BiLSTM-CRF architectures on the N2C2 ADE benchmark, results show that the proposed approach trains 22 times faster and reduces GPU memory consumption by 1.75 folds, with a reasonable performance tradeoff of 90%, without the use of external tools, hand-crafted rules or post-processing. Given the significant carbon footprint of deep learning models and the current energy crises, these methods could support efficient and cleaner information extraction in EHRs and other types of large-scale document databases. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent text-to-image diffusion models such as MidJourney and Stable Diffusion threaten to displace many in the professional artist community. In particular, models can learn to mimic the artistic style of specific artists after "fine-tuning" on samples of their art. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of Glaze, a tool that enables artists to apply "style cloaks" to their art before sharing online. These cloaks apply barely perceptible perturbations to images, and when used as training data, mislead generative models that try to mimic a specific artist. In coordination with the professional artist community, we deploy user studies to more than 1000 artists, assessing their views of AI art, as well as the efficacy of our tool, its usability and tolerability of perturbations, and robustness across different scenarios and against adaptive countermeasures. Both surveyed artists and empirical CLIP-based scores show that even at low perturbation levels (p=0.05), Glaze is highly successful at disrupting mimicry under normal conditions (&gt;92%) and against adaptive countermeasures (&gt;85%). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: To generalize across tasks, an agent should acquire knowledge from past tasks that facilitate adaptation and exploration in future tasks. We focus on the problem of in-context adaptation and exploration, where an agent only relies on context, i.e., history of states, actions and/or rewards, rather than gradient-based updates. Posterior sampling (extension of Thompson sampling) is a promising approach, but it requires Bayesian inference and dynamic programming, which often involve unknowns (e.g., a prior) and costly computations. To address these difficulties, we use a transformer to learn an inference process from training tasks and consider a hypothesis space of partial models, represented as small Markov decision processes that are cheap for dynamic programming. In our version of the Symbolic Alchemy benchmark, our method's adaptation speed and exploration-exploitation balance approach those of an exact posterior sampling oracle. We also show that even though partial models exclude relevant information from the environment, they can nevertheless lead to good policies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We initiate a principled study of algorithmic collective action on digital platforms that deploy machine learning algorithms. We propose a simple theoretical model of a collective interacting with a firm's learning algorithm. The collective pools the data of participating individuals and executes an algorithmic strategy by instructing participants how to modify their own data to achieve a collective goal. We investigate the consequences of this model in three fundamental learning-theoretic settings: the case of a nonparametric optimal learning algorithm, a parametric risk minimizer, and gradient-based optimization. In each setting, we come up with coordinated algorithmic strategies and characterize natural success criteria as a function of the collective's size. Complementing our theory, we conduct systematic experiments on a skill classification task involving tens of thousands of resumes from a gig platform for freelancers. Through more than two thousand model training runs of a BERT-like language model, we see a striking correspondence emerge between our empirical observations and the predictions made by our theory. Taken together, our theory and experiments broadly support the conclusion that algorithmic collectives of exceedingly small fractional size can exert significant control over a platform's learning algorithm. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

In order to streamline the development and deployment of NeRF research, we propose a modular PyTorch framework, Nerfstudio.

Additionally, the modular design enables support for extensive real-time visualization tools, streamlined pipelines for importing captured in-the-wild data, and tools for exporting to video, point cloud and mesh representations. The modularity of Nerfstudio enables the development of Nerfacto, our method that combines components from recent papers to achieve a balance between speed and quality, while also remaining flexible to future modifications.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce a new family of physics-inspired generative models termed PFGM++ that unifies diffusion models and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). These models realize generative trajectories for $N$ dimensional data by embedding paths in $N{+}D$ dimensional space while still controlling the progression with a simple scalar norm of the $D$ additional variables. The new models reduce to PFGM when $D{=}1$ and to diffusion models when $D{\to}\infty$. The flexibility of choosing $D$ allows us to trade off robustness against rigidity as increasing $D$ results in more concentrated coupling between the data and the additional variable norms. We dispense with the biased large batch field targets used in PFGM and instead provide an unbiased perturbation-based objective similar to diffusion models. To explore different choices of $D$, we provide a direct alignment method for transferring well-tuned hyperparameters from diffusion models ($D{\to} \infty$) to any finite $D$ values. Our experiments show that models with finite $D$ can be superior to previous state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR-10/FFHQ $64{\times}64$ datasets, with FID scores of $1.91/2.43$ when $D{=}2048/128$. In addition, we demonstrate that models with smaller $D$ exhibit improved robustness against modeling errors.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Score-based generative modeling, informally referred to as diffusion models, continue to grow in popularity across several important domains and tasks. While they provide high-quality and diverse samples from empirical distributions, important questions remain on the reliability and trustworthiness of these sampling procedures for their responsible use in critical scenarios. Conformal prediction is a modern tool to construct finite-sample, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees for any black-box predictor. In this work, we focus on image-to-image regression tasks and we present a generalization of the Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets (RCPS) procedure, that we term $K$-RCPS, which allows to $(i)$ provide entrywise calibrated intervals for future samples of any diffusion model, and $(ii)$ control a certain notion of risk with respect to a ground truth image with minimal mean interval length. Differently from existing conformal risk control procedures, ours relies on a novel convex optimization approach that allows for multidimensional risk control while provably minimizing the mean interval length. We illustrate our approach on two real-world image denoising problems: on natural images of faces as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen, demonstrating state of the art performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This dissertation highlights the growing interest in and adoption of machine learning (ML) approaches for fault detection in modern power grids. Once a fault has occurred, it must be identified quickly and preventative steps must be taken to remove or insulate it. As a result, detecting, locating, and classifying faults early and accurately can improve safety and dependability while reducing downtime and hardware damage. ML-based solutions and tools to carry out effective data processing and analysis to aid power system operations and decision-making are becoming preeminent with better system condition awareness and data availability. Power transformers, Phase Shift Transformers or Phase Angle Regulators, and transmission lines are critical components in power systems, and ensuring their safety is a primary issue. Differential relays are commonly employed to protect transformers, whereas distance relays are utilized to protect transmission lines. Magnetizing inrush, overexcitation, and current transformer saturation make transformer protection a challenge. Furthermore, non-standard phase shift, series core saturation, low turn-to-turn, and turn-to-ground fault currents are non-traditional problems associated with Phase Angle Regulators. Faults during symmetrical power swings and unstable power swings may cause mal-operation of distance relays and unintentional and uncontrolled islanding. The distance relays also mal-operate for transmission lines connected to type-3 wind farms. The conventional protection techniques would no longer be adequate to address the above challenges due to limitations in handling and analyzing massive amounts of data, limited generalizability, incapability to model non-linear systems, etc. These limitations of differential and distance protection methods bring forward the motivation of using ML in addressing various protection challenges. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Radiotherapy (RT) combined with cetuximab is the standard treatment for patients with inoperable head and neck cancers. Segmentation of head and neck (H&amp;N) tumors is a prerequisite for radiotherapy planning but a time-consuming process. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have become the de facto standard for automated image segmentation. However, due to the expensive computational cost associated with enlarging the field of view in DCNNs, their ability to model long-range dependency is still limited, and this can result in sub-optimal segmentation performance for objects with background context spanning over long distances. On the other hand, Transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in several semantic segmentation tasks performed on medical images. Inspired by the recent success of Vision Transformers and advances in multi-modal image analysis, we propose a novel segmentation model, debuted, Cross-Modal Swin Transformer (SwinCross), with cross-modal attention (CMA) module to incorporate cross-modal feature extraction at multiple resolutions.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on the HECKTOR 2021 challenge dataset and compared it with the nnU-Net (the backbone of the top-5 methods in HECKTOR 2021) and other state-of-the-art transformer-based methods such as UNETR, and Swin UNETR. The proposed method is experimentally shown to outperform these comparing methods thanks to the ability of the CMA module to capture better inter-modality complimentary feature representations between PET and CT, for the task of head-and-neck tumor segmentation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
