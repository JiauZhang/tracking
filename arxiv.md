        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative AI models have recently achieved astonishing results in quality and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. However, since they are highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets randomly scraped from the internet, they also suffer from degenerated and biased human behavior, as we demonstrate. In fact, they may even reinforce such biases. To not only uncover but also combat these undesired effects, we present a novel strategy, called Fair Diffusion, to attenuate biases after the deployment of generative text-to-image models. Specifically, we demonstrate shifting a bias, based on human instructions, in any direction yielding arbitrarily new proportions for, e.g., identity groups. As our empirical evaluation demonstrates, this introduced control enables instructing generative image models on fairness, with no data filtering and additional training required. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as one of the most powerful generative models in recent years. They have achieved remarkable success in many fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and bioinformatics. Although there are a few excellent reviews on diffusion models and their applications in computer vision and NLP, there is a lack of an overview of their applications in bioinformatics. This review aims to provide a rather thorough overview of the applications of diffusion models in bioinformatics to aid their further development in bioinformatics and computational biology. We start with an introduction of the key concepts and theoretical foundations of three cornerstone diffusion modeling frameworks (denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise-conditioned scoring networks, and stochastic differential equations), followed by a comprehensive description of diffusion models employed in the different domains of bioinformatics, including cryo-EM data enhancement, single-cell data analysis, protein design and generation, drug and small molecule design, and protein-ligand interaction. The review is concluded with a summary of the potential new development and applications of diffusion models in bioinformatics. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning with imbalanced data is a challenging problem in deep learning. Over-sampling is a widely used technique to re-balance the sampling distribution of training data. However, most existing over-sampling methods only use intra-class information of minority classes to augment the data but ignore the inter-class relationships with the majority ones, which is prone to overfitting, especially when the imbalance ratio is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel over-sampling model, called Majority-Guided VAE~(MGVAE), which generates new minority samples under the guidance of a majority-based prior. In this way, the newly generated minority samples can inherit the diversity and richness of the majority ones, thus mitigating overfitting in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to prevent model collapse under limited data, we first pre-train MGVAE on sufficient majority samples and then fine-tune based on minority samples with Elastic Weight Consolidation(EWC) regularization. Experimental results on benchmark image datasets and real-world tabular data show that MGVAE achieves competitive improvements over other over-sampling methods in downstream classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize Statistical Process Control (SPC) practice, learning, and research. However, these tools are in the early stages of development and can be easily misused or misunderstood. In this paper, we give an overview of the development of Generative AI. Specifically, we explore ChatGPT's ability to provide code, explain basic concepts, and create knowledge related to SPC practice, learning, and research. By investigating responses to structured prompts, we highlight the benefits and limitations of the results. Our study indicates that the current version of ChatGPT performs well for structured tasks, such as translating code from one language to another and explaining well-known concepts but struggles with more nuanced tasks, such as explaining less widely known terms and creating code from scratch. We find that using new AI tools may help practitioners, educators, and researchers to be more efficient and productive. However, in their current stages of development, some results are misleading and wrong. Overall, the use of generative AI models in SPC must be properly validated and used in conjunction with other methods to ensure accurate results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We investigate a macro-element variant of the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, using patches of standard simplicial elements that can have non-matching interfaces. Coupled via the HDG technique, our method enables local refinement by uniform simplicial subdivision of each macro-element. By enforcing one spatial discretization for all macro-elements, we arrive at local problems per macro-element that are embarrassingly parallel, yet well balanced. Therefore, our macro-element variant scales efficiently to n-node clusters and can be tailored to available hardware by adjusting the local problem size to the capacity of a single node, while still using moderate polynomial orders such as quadratics or cubics. Increasing the local problem size means simultaneously decreasing, in relative terms, the global problem size, hence effectively limiting the proliferation of degrees of freedom. The global problem is solved via a matrix-free iterative technique that also heavily relies on macro-element local operations. We investigate and discuss the advantages and limitations of the macro-element HDG method via an advection-diffusion model problem. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: An implicit Euler finite-volume scheme for a nonlocal cross-diffusion system on the one-dimensional torus, arising in population dynamics, is proposed and analyzed. The kernels are assumed to be in detailed balance and satisfy a weak cross-diffusion condition. The latter condition allows for negative off-diagonal coefficients and for kernels defined by an indicator function. The scheme preserves the nonnegativity of the densities, conservation of mass, and production of the Boltzmann and Rao entropies. The key idea is to ``translate'' the entropy calculations for the continuous equations to the finite-volume scheme, in particular to design discretizations of the mobilities, which guarantee a discrete chain rule even in the presence of nonlocal terms. Based on this idea, the existence of finite-volume solutions and the convergence of the scheme are proven. As a by-product, we deduce the existence of weak solutions to the continuous cross-diffusion system. Finally, we present some numerical experiments illustrating the behavior of the solutions to the nonlocal and associated local models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning provides an excellent avenue for optimizing diagnosis and patient monitoring for clinical-based applications, which can critically enhance the response time to the onset of various conditions. For cardiovascular disease, one such condition where the rising number of patients increasingly outweighs the availability of medical resources in different parts of the world, a core challenge is the automated classification of various cardiac abnormalities. Existing deep learning approaches have largely been limited to detecting the existence of an irregularity, as in binary classification, which has been achieved using networks such as CNNs and RNN/LSTMs. The next step is to accurately perform multi-class classification and determine the specific condition(s) from the inherently noisy multi-variate waveform, which is a difficult task that could benefit from (1) a more powerful sequential network, and (2) the integration of clinical notes, which provide valuable semantic and clinical context from human doctors. Recently, Transformers have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for forecasting and prediction using time-series data, with their multi-headed attention mechanism, and ability to process whole sequences and learn both long and short-range dependencies. The proposed novel multi-modal Transformer architecture would be able to accurately perform this task while demonstrating the cross-domain effectiveness of Transformers, establishing a method for incorporating multiple data modalities within a Transformer for classification tasks, and laying the groundwork for automating real-time patient condition monitoring in clinical and ER settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-time video surveillance, through CCTV camera systems has become essential for ensuring public safety which is a priority today. Although CCTV cameras help a lot in increasing security, these systems require constant human interaction and monitoring. To eradicate this issue, intelligent surveillance systems can be built using deep learning video classification techniques that can help us automate surveillance systems to detect violence as it happens. In this research, we explore deep learning video classification techniques to detect violence as they are happening. Traditional image classification techniques fall short when it comes to classifying videos as they attempt to classify each frame separately for which the predictions start to flicker. Therefore, many researchers are coming up with video classification techniques that consider spatiotemporal features while classifying. However, deploying these deep learning models with methods such as skeleton points obtained through pose estimation and optical flow obtained through depth sensors, are not always practical in an IoT environment. Although these techniques ensure a higher accuracy score, they are computationally heavier. Keeping these constraints in mind, we experimented with various video classification and action recognition techniques such as ConvLSTM, LRCN (with both custom CNN layers and VGG-16 as feature extractor) CNNTransformer and C3D. We achieved a test accuracy of 80% on ConvLSTM, 83.33% on CNN-BiLSTM, 70% on VGG16-BiLstm ,76.76% on CNN-Transformer and 80% on C3D. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Edges in many real-world social/information networks are associated with rich text information (e.g., user-user communications or user-product reviews). However, mainstream network representation learning models focus on propagating and aggregating node attributes, lacking specific designs to utilize text semantics on edges. While there exist edge-aware graph neural networks, they directly initialize edge attributes as a feature vector, which cannot fully capture the contextualized text semantics of edges. In this paper, we propose Edgeformers, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way. Specifically, in edge representation learning, we inject network information into each Transformer layer when encoding edge texts; in node representation learning, we aggregate edge representations through an attention mechanism within each node's ego-graph. On five public datasets from three different domains, Edgeformers consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in edge classification and link prediction, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and node representations, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep active learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training deep learning models within a predefined labeling budget. These models have achieved performances comparable to those trained in an offline setting. However, deep active learning faces substantial issues when dealing with classification datasets containing noisy labels. In this literature review, we discuss the current state of deep active learning in the presence of label noise, highlighting unique approaches, their strengths, and weaknesses. With the recent success of vision transformers in image classification tasks, we provide a brief overview and consider how the transformer layers and attention mechanisms can be used to enhance diversity, importance, and uncertainty-based selection in queries sent to an oracle for labeling. We further propose exploring contrastive learning methods to derive good image representations that can aid in selecting high-value samples for labeling in an active learning setting. We also highlight the need for creating unified benchmarks and standardized datasets for deep active learning in the presence of label noise for image classification to promote the reproducibility of research. The review concludes by suggesting avenues for future research in this area. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) recognition involves simultaneously diagnosing and identifying multiple labels for different pathologies. Since pathological labels have rich information about their relationship to each other, modeling the co-occurrence dependencies between pathological labels is essential to improve recognition performance. However, previous methods rely on state variable coding and attention mechanisms-oriented to model local label information, and lack learning of global co-occurrence relationships between labels. Furthermore, these methods roughly integrate image features and label embedding, ignoring the alignment and compactness problems in cross-modal vector fusion.To solve these problems, a Bi-modal Bridged Graph Convolutional Network (BB-GCN) model is proposed. This model mainly consists of a backbone module, a pathology Label Co-occurrence relationship Embedding (LCE) module, and a Transformer Bridge Graph (TBG) module. Specifically, the backbone module obtains image visual feature representation. The LCE module utilizes a graph to model the global co-occurrence relationship between multiple labels and employs graph convolutional networks for learning inference. The TBG module bridges the cross-modal vectors more compactly and efficiently through the GroupSum method.We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed BB-GCN in two large-scale CXR datasets (ChestX-Ray14 and CheXpert). Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance: the mean AUC scores for the 14 pathologies were 0.835 and 0.813, respectively.The proposed LCE and TBG modules can jointly effectively improve the recognition performance of BB-GCN. Our model also achieves satisfactory results in multi-label chest X-ray recognition and exhibits highly competitive generalization performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Advances in the field of visual-language contrastive learning have made it possible for many downstream applications to be carried out efficiently and accurately by simply taking the dot product between image and text representations. One of the most representative approaches proposed recently known as CLIP has quickly garnered widespread adoption due to its effectiveness. CLIP is trained with an InfoNCE loss that takes into account both positive and negative samples to help learn a much more robust representation space. This paper however reveals that the common downstream practice of taking a dot product is only a zeroth-order approximation of the optimization goal, resulting in a loss of information during test-time. Intuitively, since the model has been optimized based on the InfoNCE loss, test-time procedures should ideally also be in alignment. The question lies in how one can retrieve any semblance of negative samples information during inference. We propose Distribution Normalization (DN), where we approximate the mean representation of a batch of test samples and use such a mean to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss. DN requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream tasks exhibit a clear advantage of DN over the dot product. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale multi-modal pre-training models such as CLIP and PaLI exhibit strong generalization on various visual domains and tasks. However, existing image classification benchmarks often evaluate recognition on a specific domain (e.g., outdoor images) or a specific task (e.g., classifying plant species), which falls short of evaluating whether pre-trained foundational models are universal visual recognizers. To address this, we formally present the task of Open-domain Visual Entity recognitioN (OVEN), where a model need to link an image onto a Wikipedia entity with respect to a text query. We construct OVEN-Wiki by re-purposing 14 existing datasets with all labels grounded onto one single label space: Wikipedia entities. OVEN challenges models to select among six million possible Wikipedia entities, making it a general visual recognition benchmark with the largest number of labels. Our study on state-of-the-art pre-trained models reveals large headroom in generalizing to the massive-scale label space. We show that a PaLI-based auto-regressive visual recognition model performs surprisingly well, even on Wikipedia entities that have never been seen during fine-tuning. We also find existing pretrained models yield different strengths: while PaLI-based models obtain higher overall performance, CLIP-based models are better at recognizing tail entities. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Therefore, organizers provide a wind power dataset containing historical data from 134 wind turbines and launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limitations of current methods for wind power forecasting. The average of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is used as the evaluation score. We adopt two spatial-temporal graph neural network models, i.e., AGCRN and MTGNN, as our basic models. We train AGCRN by 5-fold cross-validation and additionally train MTGNN directly on the training and validation sets. Finally, we ensemble the two models based on the loss values of the validation set as our final submission. Using our method, our team \team achieves -45.36026 on the test set. We release our codes on Github (https://github.com/BUAABIGSCity/KDDCUP2022) for reproduction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Visual speech (i.e., lip motion) is highly related to auditory speech due to the co-occurrence and synchronization in speech production. This paper investigates this correlation and proposes a cross-modal speech co-learning paradigm. The primary motivation of our cross-modal co-learning method is modeling one modality aided by exploiting knowledge from another modality. Specifically, two cross-modal boosters are introduced based on an audio-visual pseudo-siamese structure to learn the modality-transformed correlation. Inside each booster, a max-feature-map embedded Transformer variant is proposed for modality alignment and enhanced feature generation. The network is co-learned both from scratch and with pretrained models. Experimental results on the LRSLip3, GridLip, LomGridLip, and VoxLip datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 60% and 20% average relative performance improvement over independently trained audio-only/visual-only and baseline fusion systems, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Global problems, such as pandemics and climate change, require rapid international coordination and diffusion of policy. These phenomena are rare however, with one notable example being the international policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Here we build an agent-based model of this rapid policy diffusion, where countries constitute the agents and with the principal mechanism for diffusion being peer mimicry. Since it is challenging to predict accurately the policy diffusion curve, we utilize data assimilation, that is an ``on-line'' feed of data to constrain the model against observations. The specific data assimilation algorithm we apply is a particle filter because of its convenient implementation, its ability to handle categorical variables and because the model is not overly computationally expensive, hence a more efficient algorithm is not required. We find that the model alone is able to predict the policy diffusion relatively well with an ensemble of at least 100 simulation runs. The particle filter however improves the fit to the data, reliably so from 500 runs upwards, and increasing filtering frequency results in improved prediction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper presents a deep learning framework for medical video segmentation. Convolution neural network (CNN) and transformer-based methods have achieved great milestones in medical image segmentation tasks due to their incredible semantic feature encoding and global information comprehension abilities. However, most existing approaches ignore a salient aspect of medical video data - the temporal dimension. Our proposed framework explicitly extracts features from neighbouring frames across the temporal dimension and incorporates them with a temporal feature blender, which then tokenises the high-level spatio-temporal feature to form a strong global feature encoded via a Swin Transformer. The final segmentation results are produced via a UNet-like encoder-decoder architecture. Our model outperforms other approaches by a significant margin and improves the segmentation benchmarks on the VFSS2022 dataset, achieving a dice coefficient of 0.8986 and 0.8186 for the two datasets tested. Our studies also show the efficacy of the temporal feature blending scheme and cross-dataset transferability of learned capabilities.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of message-passing based graph neural networks (GNNs), e.g., limited model expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, etc. To alleviate these issues, Graph Transformers (GTs) have been proposed which work in the paradigm that allows message passing to a larger coverage even across the whole graph. Hinging on the global range attention mechanism, GTs have shown a superpower for representation learning on homogeneous graphs. However, the investigation of GTs on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is still under-exploited. In particular, on account of the existence of heterogeneity, HINs show distinct data characteristics and thus require different treatment. To bridge this gap, in this paper we investigate the representation learning on HINs with Graph Transformer, and propose a novel model named HINormer, which capitalizes on a larger-range aggregation mechanism for node representation learning. In particular, assisted by two major modules, i.e., a local structure encoder and a heterogeneous relation encoder, HINormer can capture both the structural and heterogeneous information of nodes on HINs for comprehensive node representations. We conduct extensive experiments on four HIN benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: An important component of human analysis of medical images and their context is the ability to relate newly seen things to related instances in our memory. In this paper we mimic this ability by using multi-modal retrieval augmentation and apply it to several tasks in chest X-ray analysis. By retrieving similar images and/or radiology reports we expand and regularize the case at hand with additional knowledge, while maintaining factual knowledge consistency. The method consists of two components. First, vision and language modalities are aligned using a pre-trained CLIP model. To enforce that the retrieval focus will be on detailed disease-related content instead of global visual appearance it is fine-tuned using disease class information. Subsequently, we construct a non-parametric retrieval index, which reaches state-of-the-art retrieval levels. We use this index in our downstream tasks to augment image representations through multi-head attention for disease classification and report retrieval. We show that retrieval augmentation gives considerable improvements on these tasks. Our downstream report retrieval even shows to be competitive with dedicated report generation methods, paving the path for this method in medical imaging. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse effectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit from combination with other prompt patterns. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing text-guided image manipulation methods aim to modify the appearance of the image or to edit a few objects in a virtual or simple scenario, which is far from practical applications. In this work, we study a novel task on text-guided image manipulation on the entity level in the real world (eL-TGIM). The task imposes three basic requirements, (1) to edit the entity consistent with the text descriptions, (2) to preserve the entity-irrelevant regions, and (3) to merge the manipulated entity into the image naturally. To this end, we propose an elegant framework, dubbed as SeMani, forming the Semantic Manipulation of real-world images that can not only edit the appearance of entities but also generate new entities corresponding to the text guidance. To solve eL-TGIM, SeMani decomposes the task into two phases: the semantic alignment phase and the image manipulation phase. In the semantic alignment phase, SeMani incorporates a semantic alignment module to locate the entity-relevant region to be manipulated. In the image manipulation phase, SeMani adopts a generative model to synthesize new images conditioned on the entity-irrelevant regions and target text descriptions. We discuss and propose two popular generation processes that can be utilized in SeMani, the discrete auto-regressive generation with transformers and the continuous denoising generation with diffusion models, yielding SeMani-Trans and SeMani-Diff, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on the real datasets CUB, Oxford, and COCO datasets to verify that SeMani can distinguish the entity-relevant and -irrelevant regions and achieve more precise and flexible manipulation in a zero-shot manner compared with baseline methods. Our codes and models will be released at https://github.com/Yikai-Wang/SeMani. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Data scarcity is a problem that occurs in languages and tasks where we do not have large amounts of labeled data but want to use state-of-the-art models. Such models are often deep learning models that require a significant amount of data to train. Acquiring data for various machine learning problems is accompanied by high labeling costs. Data augmentation is a low-cost approach for tackling data scarcity. This paper gives an overview of current state-of-the-art data augmentation methods used for natural language processing, with an emphasis on methods for neural and transformer-based models. Furthermore, it discusses the practical challenges of data augmentation, possible mitigations, and directions for future research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: StyleGAN2 was demonstrated to be a powerful image generation engine that supports semantic editing. However, in order to manipulate a real-world image, one first needs to be able to retrieve its corresponding latent representation in StyleGAN's latent space that is decoded to an image as close as possible to the desired image. For many real-world images, a latent representation does not exist, which necessitates the tuning of the generator network. We present a per-image optimization method that tunes a StyleGAN2 generator such that it achieves a local edit to the generator's weights, resulting in almost perfect inversion, while still allowing image editing, by keeping the rest of the mapping between an input latent representation tensor and an output image relatively intact. The method is based on a one-shot training of a set of shallow update networks (aka. Gradient Modification Modules) that modify the layers of the generator. After training the Gradient Modification Modules, a modified generator is obtained by a single application of these networks to the original parameters, and the previous editing capabilities of the generator are maintained. Our experiments show a sizable gap in performance over the current state of the art in this very active domain.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion Schr\"odinger bridges (DSB) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for recovering stochastic dynamics via their marginal observations at different time points. Despite numerous successful applications, existing algorithms for solving DSBs have so far failed to utilize the structure of aligned data, which naturally arises in many biological phenomena. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework that, for the first time, solves DSBs while respecting the data alignment. Our approach hinges on a combination of two decades-old ideas: The classical Schr\"odinger bridge theory and Doob's $h$-transform. Compared to prior methods, our approach leads to a simpler training procedure with lower variance, which we further augment with principled regularization schemes. This ultimately leads to sizeable improvements across experiments on synthetic and real data, including the tasks of rigid protein docking and temporal evolution of cellular differentiation processes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in robot learning have shown promise in enabling robots to perform a variety of manipulation tasks and generalize to novel scenarios. One of the key contributing factors to this progress is the scale of robot data used to train the models. To obtain large-scale datasets, prior approaches have relied on either demonstrations requiring high human involvement or engineering-heavy autonomous data collection schemes, both of which are challenging to scale. To mitigate this issue, we propose an alternative route and leverage text-to-image foundation models widely used in computer vision and natural language processing to obtain meaningful data for robot learning without requiring additional robot data. We term our method Robot Learning with Semantically Imagened Experience (ROSIE). Specifically, we make use of the state of the art text-to-image diffusion models and perform aggressive data augmentation on top of our existing robotic manipulation datasets via inpainting various unseen objects for manipulation, backgrounds, and distractors with text guidance. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show that manipulation policies trained on data augmented this way are able to solve completely unseen tasks with new objects and can behave more robustly w.r.t. novel distractors. In addition, we find that we can improve the robustness and generalization of high-level robot learning tasks such as success detection through training with the diffusion-based data augmentation.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Since their introduction, diffusion models have quickly become the prevailing approach to generative modeling in many domains. They can be interpreted as learning the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density functions. This interpretation has motivated classifier-based and classifier-free guidance as methods for post-hoc control of diffusion models. In this work, we build upon these ideas using the score-based interpretation of diffusion models, and explore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models for tasks involving compositional generation and guidance. In particular, we investigate why certain types of composition fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that the sampler (not the model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers, inspired by MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation. Further, we propose an energy-based parameterization of diffusion models which enables the use of new compositional operators and more sophisticated, Metropolis-corrected samplers. Intriguingly we find these samplers lead to notable improvements in compositional generation across a wide set of problems such as classifier-guided ImageNet modeling and compositional text-to-image generation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we consider the problem of disease diagnosis. Unlike the conventional learning paradigm that treats labels independently, we propose a knowledge-enhanced framework, that enables training visual representation with the guidance of medical domain knowledge. In particular, we make the following contributions: First, to explicitly incorporate experts' knowledge, we propose to learn a neural representation for the medical knowledge graph via contrastive learning, implicitly establishing relations between different medical concepts. Second, while training the visual encoder, we keep the parameters of the knowledge encoder frozen and propose to learn a set of prompt vectors for efficient adaptation. Third, we adopt a Transformer-based disease-query module for cross-model fusion, which naturally enables explainable diagnosis results via cross attention. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct thorough experiments on three x-ray imaging datasets across different anatomy structures, showing our model is able to exploit the implicit relations between diseases/findings, thus is beneficial to the commonly encountered problem in the medical domain, namely, long-tailed and zero-shot recognition, which conventional methods either struggle or completely fail to realize. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advancements in GANs and diffusion models have enabled the creation of high-resolution, hyper-realistic images. However, these models may misrepresent certain social groups and present bias. Understanding bias in these models remains an important research question, especially for tasks that support critical decision-making and could affect minorities. The contribution of this work is a novel analysis covering architectures and embedding spaces for fine-grained understanding of bias over three approaches: generators, attribute modifier, and post-processing bias mitigators. This work shows that generators suffer from bias across all social groups with attribute preferences such as between 75%-85% for whiteness and 60%-80% for the female gender (for all trained CelebA models) and low probabilities of generating children and older men. Modifier and mitigators work as post-processor and change the generator performance. For instance, attribute channel perturbation strategies modify the embedding spaces. We quantify the influence of this change on group fairness by measuring the impact on image quality and group features. Specifically, we use the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), the Face Matching Error and the Self-Similarity score. For Interfacegan, we analyze one and two attribute channel perturbations and examine the effect on the fairness distribution and the quality of the image. Finally, we analyzed the post-processing bias mitigators, which are the fastest and most computationally efficient way to mitigate bias. We find that these mitigation techniques show similar results on KL divergence and FID score, however, self-similarity scores show a different feature concentration on the new groups of the data distribution. The weaknesses and ongoing challenges described in this work must be considered in the pursuit of creating fair and unbiased face generation models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Super-resolution plays an essential role in medical imaging because it provides an alternative way to achieve high spatial resolutions and image quality with no extra acquisition costs. In the past few decades, the rapid development of deep neural networks has promoted super-resolution performance with novel network architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics. Specifically, vision transformers dominate a broad range of computer vision tasks, but challenges still exist when applying them to low-level medical image processing tasks. This paper proposes an efficient vision transformer with residual dense connections and local feature fusion, aiming to achieve efficient single-image super-resolution (SISR) of medical modalities. Moreover, we implement a general-purpose perceptual loss with manual control for image quality improvements of desired aspects by incorporating prior knowledge of medical image segmentation. Compared with state-of-the-art methods on four public medical image datasets, the proposed method achieves the best PSNR scores of 6 modalities among seven modalities in total. It leads to an average improvement of $+0.09$ dB PSNR with only 38\% parameters of SwinIR. On the other hand, the segmentation-based perceptual loss increases $+0.14$ dB PSNR on average for SOTA methods, including CNNs and vision transformers. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to discuss potential factors for the superior performance of vision transformers over CNNs and the impacts of network and loss function components. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Gaussianity assumption has been pointed out as the main limitation of the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) in spite of its usefulness in computation. To improve the distributional capacity (i.e., expressive power of distributional family) of the VAE, we propose a new VAE learning method with a nonparametric distributional assumption on its generative model. By estimating an infinite number of conditional quantiles, our proposed VAE model directly estimates the conditional cumulative distribution function, and we call this approach distributional learning of the VAE. Furthermore, by adopting the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) loss, our proposed learning method becomes computationally tractable. To evaluate how well the underlying distribution of the dataset is captured, we apply our model for synthetic data generation based on inverse transform sampling. Numerical results with real tabular datasets corroborate our arguments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
