        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The rapid scaling of language models is motivating research using low-bitwidth quantization. In this work, we propose a novel binarization technique for Transformers applied to machine translation (BMT), the first of its kind. We identify and address the problem of inflated dot-product variance when using one-bit weights and activations. Specifically, BMT leverages additional LayerNorms and residual connections to improve binarization quality. Experiments on the WMT dataset show that a one-bit weight-only Transformer can achieve the same quality as a float one, while being 16x smaller in size. One-bit activations incur varying degrees of quality drop, but mitigated by the proposed architectural changes. We further conduct a scaling law study using production-scale translation datasets, which shows that one-bit weight Transformers scale and generalize well in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Implementation in JAX/Flax will be open sourced. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large pre-training language models (PLMs) have shown promising in-context learning abilities. However, due to the backbone transformer architecture, existing PLMs are bottlenecked by the memory and computational cost when scaling up to a large context size, leaving instruction tuning and in-context learning of many demonstration examples, as well as long-range language modeling under-explored. In this study, we propose a long-range language model EVALM based on an efficient transformer mechanism. EVALM is trained with 8k tokens per batch line and can test up to 256k-lengthed contexts with extrapolation, 128 times to the limit of existing PLMs (e.g. GPT3). Based on EVALM, we scale up the size of examples efficiently in both instruction tuning and in-context learning to explore the boundary of the benefits from more annotated data. Experimental results on a diverse set of tasks show that EVALM achieves 4.1% higher accuracy on average, and the average length of achieving the best accuracy score over tasks is around 12k. We find that in-context learning can achieve higher performance with more demonstrations under many-shot instruction tuning (8k), and further extending the length of instructions (16k) can further improve the upper bound of scaling in-context learning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning methods find a solution to a boundary value problem by defining loss functions of neural networks based on governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Furthermore, the authors show that when it comes to many engineering problems, designing the loss functions based on first-order derivatives results in much better accuracy, especially when there is heterogeneity and variable jumps in the domain \cite{REZAEI2022PINN}. The so-called mixed formulation for PINN is applied to basic engineering problems such as the balance of linear momentum and diffusion problems. In this work, the proposed mixed formulation is further extended to solve multi-physical problems. In particular, we focus on a stationary thermo-mechanically coupled system of equations that can be utilized in designing the microstructure of advanced materials. First, sequential unsupervised training, and second, fully coupled unsupervised learning are discussed. The results of each approach are compared in terms of accuracy and corresponding computational cost. Finally, the idea of transfer learning is employed by combining data and physics to address the capability of the network to predict the response of the system for unseen cases. The outcome of this work will be useful for many other engineering applications where DL is employed on multiple coupled systems of equations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent research using pre-trained transformer models suggests that just 10 minutes of transcribed speech may be enough to fine-tune such a model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) -- at least if we can also leverage vast amounts of text data (803 million tokens). But is that much text data necessary? We study the use of different amounts of text data, both for creating a lexicon that constrains ASR decoding to possible words (e.g. *dogz vs. dogs), and for training larger language models that bias the system toward probable word sequences (e.g. too dogs vs. two dogs). We perform experiments using 10 minutes of transcribed speech from English (for replicating prior work) and two additional pairs of languages differing in the availability of supplemental text data: Gronings and Frisian (~7.5M token corpora available), and Besemah and Nasal (only small lexica available). For all languages, we found that using only a lexicon did not appreciably improve ASR performance. For Gronings and Frisian, we found that lexica and language models derived from 'novel-length' 80k token subcorpora reduced the word error rate (WER) to 39% on average. Our findings suggest that where a text corpus in the upper tens of thousands of tokens or more is available, fine-tuning a transformer model with just tens of minutes of transcribed speech holds some promise towards obtaining human-correctable transcriptions near the 30% WER rule-of-thumb. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Speech-to-text errors made by automatic speech recognition (ASR) system negatively impact downstream models relying on ASR transcriptions. Language error correction models as a post-processing text editing approach have been recently developed for refining the source sentences. However, efficient models for correcting errors in ASR transcriptions that meet the low latency requirements of industrial grade production systems have not been well studied. In this work, we propose a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) error correction approach to improve the transcription quality by reducing word error rate (WER) and achieve robust performance across different upstream ASR systems. Our approach augments the text encoding of the Transformer model with a phoneme encoder that embeds pronunciation information. The representations from phoneme encoder and text encoder are combined via multi-modal fusion before feeding into the length tagging predictor for predicting target sequence lengths. The joint encoders also provide inputs to the attention mechanism in the NAR decoder. We experiment on 3 open-source ASR systems with varying speech-to-text transcription quality and their erroneous transcriptions on 2 public English corpus datasets. Results show that our PATCorrect (Phoneme Augmented Transformer for ASR error Correction) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAR error correction method on English corpus across different upstream ASR systems. For example, PATCorrect achieves 11.62% WER reduction (WERR) averaged on 3 ASR systems compared to 9.46% WERR achieved by other method using text only modality and also achieves an inference latency comparable to other NAR models at tens of millisecond scale, especially on GPU hardware, while still being 4.2 - 6.7x times faster than autoregressive models on Common Voice and LibriSpeech datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we are dedicated to leveraging the BERT pre-training success and modeling the domain-specific statistics to fertilize the sign language recognition~(SLR) model. Considering the dominance of hand and body in sign language expression, we organize them as pose triplet units and feed them into the Transformer backbone in a frame-wise manner. Pre-training is performed via reconstructing the masked triplet unit from the corrupted input sequence, which learns the hierarchical correlation context cues among internal and external triplet units. Notably, different from the highly semantic word token in BERT, the pose unit is a low-level signal originally located in continuous space, which prevents the direct adoption of the BERT cross-entropy objective. To this end, we bridge this semantic gap via coupling tokenization of the triplet unit. It adaptively extracts the discrete pseudo label from the pose triplet unit, which represents the semantic gesture/body state. After pre-training, we fine-tune the pre-trained encoder on the downstream SLR task, jointly with the newly added task-specific layer. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on all four benchmarks with a notable gain. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural operators, which use deep neural networks to approximate the solution mappings of partial differential equation (PDE) systems, are emerging as a new paradigm for PDE simulation. The neural operators could be trained in supervised or unsupervised ways, i.e., by using the generated data or the PDE information. The unsupervised training approach is essential when data generation is costly or the data is less qualified (e.g., insufficient and noisy). However, its performance and efficiency have plenty of room for improvement. To this end, we design a new loss function based on the Feynman-Kac formula and call the developed neural operator Monte-Carlo Neural Operator (MCNO), which can allow larger temporal steps and efficiently handle fractional diffusion operators. Our analyses show that MCNO has advantages in handling complex spatial conditions and larger temporal steps compared with other unsupervised methods. Furthermore, MCNO is more robust with the perturbation raised by the numerical scheme and operator approximation. Numerical experiments on the diffusion equation and Navier-Stokes equation show significant accuracy improvement compared with other unsupervised baselines, especially for the vibrated initial condition and long-time simulation settings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Much effort has been put into developing samplers with specific properties, such as producing blue noise, low-discrepancy, lattice or Poisson disk samples. These samplers can be slow if they rely on optimization processes, may rely on a wide range of numerical methods, are not always differentiable. The success of recent diffusion models for image generation suggests that these models could be appropriate for learning how to generate point sets from examples. However, their convolutional nature makes these methods impractical for dealing with scattered data such as point sets. We propose a generic way to produce 2-d point sets imitating existing samplers from observed point sets using a diffusion model. We address the problem of convolutional layers by leveraging neighborhood information from an optimal transport matching to a uniform grid, that allows us to benefit from fast convolutions on grids, and to support the example-based learning of non-uniform sampling patterns. We demonstrate how the differentiability of our approach can be used to optimize point sets to enforce properties. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to intense excitement about their applicability across various domains. Unfortunately, recent work has also shown that LLMs are unable to perform accurate reasoning nor solve planning problems, which may limit their usefulness for robotics-related tasks. In this work, our central question is whether LLMs are able to translate goals specified in natural language to a structured planning language. If so, LLM can act as a natural interface between the planner and human users; the translated goal can be handed to domain-independent AI planners that are very effective at planning. Our empirical results on GPT 3.5 variants show that LLMs are much better suited towards translation rather than planning. We find that LLMs are able to leverage commonsense knowledge and reasoning to furnish missing details from under-specified goals (as is often the case in natural language). However, our experiments also reveal that LLMs can fail to generate goals in tasks that involve numerical or physical (e.g., spatial) reasoning, and that LLMs are sensitive to the prompts used. As such, these models are promising for translation to structured planning languages, but care should be taken in their use. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning discriminative features for effectively separating abnormal events from normality is crucial for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) tasks. Existing approaches, both video and segment-level label oriented, mainly focus on extracting representations for anomaly data while neglecting the implication of normal data. We observe that such a scheme is sub-optimal, i.e., for better distinguishing anomaly one needs to understand what is a normal state, and may yield a higher false alarm rate. To address this issue, we propose an Uncertainty Regulated Dual Memory Units (UR-DMU) model to learn both the representations of normal data and discriminative features of abnormal data. To be specific, inspired by the traditional global and local structure on graph convolutional networks, we introduce a Global and Local Multi-Head Self Attention (GL-MHSA) module for the Transformer network to obtain more expressive embeddings for capturing associations in videos. Then, we use two memory banks, one additional abnormal memory for tackling hard samples, to store and separate abnormal and normal prototypes and maximize the margins between the two representations. Finally, we propose an uncertainty learning scheme to learn the normal data latent space, that is robust to noise from camera switching, object changing, scene transforming, etc. Extensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a sizable margin. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Traditional semantic image search methods aim to retrieve images that match the meaning of the text query. However, these methods typically search for objects on the whole image, without considering the localization of objects within the image. This paper presents an extension of existing object detection models for semantic image search that considers the semantic alignment between object proposals and text queries, with a focus on searching for objects within images. The proposed model uses a single feature extractor, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network, and a transformer encoder to encode the text query. Proposal-text alignment is performed using contrastive learning, producing a score for each proposal that reflects its semantic alignment with the text query. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) is used to generate object proposals, and the end-to-end training process allows for an efficient and effective solution for semantic image search. The proposed model was trained end-to-end, providing a promising solution for semantic image search that retrieves images that match the meaning of the text query and generates semantically relevant object proposals. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reinforcement learning has seen wide success in finetuning large language models to better align with instructions via human feedback. The so-called algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) demonstrates impressive performance on the GPT series models. However, the underlying Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm is complex and requires an additional training pipeline for reward and value networks. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach: converting feedback to instruction by relabeling the original one and training the model for better alignment in a supervised manner. Such an algorithm doesn't require any additional parameters except for the original language model and maximally reuses the pretraining pipeline. To achieve this, we formulate instruction alignment problem for language models as a goal-reaching problem in decision making. We propose Hindsight Instruction Relabeling (HIR), a novel algorithm for aligning language models with instructions. The resulting two-stage algorithm shed light to a family of reward-free approaches that utilize the hindsightly relabeled instructions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of HIR extensively on 12 challenging BigBench reasoning tasks and show that HIR outperforms the baseline algorithms and is comparable to or even surpasses supervised finetuning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a boundary element method for the accurate solution of the cell-by-cell bidomain model of electrophysiology. The cell-by-cell model, also called Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular (EMI) model, is a system of reaction-diffusion equations describing the evolution of the electric potential within each domain: intra- and extra-cellular space and the cellular membrane. The system is parabolic but degenerate because the time derivative is only in the membrane domain. In this work, we adopt a boundary-integral formulation for removing the degeneracy in the system and recast it to a parabolic equation on the membrane. The formulation is also numerically advantageous since the number of degrees of freedom is sensibly reduced compared to the original model. Specifically, we prove that the boundary-element discretization of the EMI model is equivalent to a system of ordinary differential equations, and we consider a time discretization based on the multirate explicit stabilized Runge-Kutta method. We numerically show that our scheme convergences exponentially in space for the single-cell case. We finally provide several numerical experiments of biological interest. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Solving ill-posed inverse problems requires careful formulation of prior beliefs over the signals of interest and an accurate description of their manifestation into noisy measurements. Handcrafted signal priors based on e.g. sparsity are increasingly replaced by data-driven deep generative models, and several groups have recently shown that state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models yield particularly strong performance and flexibility. In this paper, we show that the powerful paradigm of posterior sampling with diffusion models can be extended to include rich, structured, noise models. To that end, we propose a joint conditional reverse diffusion process with learned scores for the noise and signal-generating distribution. We demonstrate strong performance gains across various inverse problems with structured noise, outperforming competitive baselines that use normalizing flows and adversarial networks. This opens up new opportunities and relevant practical applications of diffusion modeling for inverse problems in the context of non-Gaussian measurements. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The proliferation of demanding applications and edge computing establishes the need for an efficient management of the underlying computing infrastructures, urging the providers to rethink their operational methods. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Proactive Fault Tolerance (IPFT) method that leverages the edge resource usage predictions through Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). More specifically, we focus on the process-faults, which are related with the inability of the infrastructure to provide Quality of Service (QoS) in acceptable ranges due to the lack of processing power. In order to tackle this challenge we propose a composite deep learning architecture that predicts the resource usage metrics of the edge nodes and triggers proactive node replications and task migration. Taking also into consideration that the edge computing infrastructure is also highly dynamic and heterogeneous, we propose an innovative Hybrid Bayesian Evolution Strategy (HBES) algorithm for automated adaptation of the resource usage models. The proposed resource usage prediction mechanism has been experimentally evaluated and compared with other state of the art methods with significant improvements in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, the IPFT mechanism that leverages the resource usage predictions has been evaluated in an extensive simulation in CloudSim Plus and the results show significant improvement compared to the reactive fault tolerance method in terms of reliability and maintainability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently, symbolic music generation with deep learning techniques has witnessed steady improvements. Most works on this topic focus on MIDI representations, but less attention has been paid to symbolic music generation using guitar tablatures (tabs) which can be used to encode multiple instruments. Tabs include information on expressive techniques and fingerings for fretted string instruments in addition to rhythm and pitch. In this work, we use the DadaGP dataset for guitar tab music generation, a corpus of over 26k songs in GuitarPro and token formats. We introduce methods to condition a Transformer-XL deep learning model to generate guitar tabs (GTR-CTRL) based on desired instrumentation (inst-CTRL) and genre (genre-CTRL). Special control tokens are appended at the beginning of each song in the training corpus. We assess the performance of the model with and without conditioning. We propose instrument presence metrics to assess the inst-CTRL model's response to a given instrumentation prompt. We trained a BERT model for downstream genre classification and used it to assess the results obtained with the genre-CTRL model. Statistical analyses evidence significant differences between the conditioned and unconditioned models. Overall, results indicate that the GTR-CTRL methods provide more flexibility and control for guitar-focused symbolic music generation than an unconditioned model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Contextualized or discourse aware commonsense inference is the task of generating coherent commonsense assertions (i.e., facts) from a given story, and a particular sentence from that story. Some problems with the task are: lack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense knowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this work, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to address the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by introducing a new technique we call "hinting". Hinting is a kind of language model prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft prompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to advise the language model "what to talk about". Next, we establish a methodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge bases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise and the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the results "still make sense" for the context. To this end, we align the textual version of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and GLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to train a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs. We show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference. Our final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the contextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility through a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual commonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible commonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple commonsense knowledge bases. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Accurate and comprehensive material databases extracted from research papers are critical for materials science and engineering but require significant human effort to develop. In this paper we present a simple method of extracting materials data from full texts of research papers suitable for quickly developing modest-sized databases. The method requires minimal to no coding, prior knowledge about the extracted property, or model training, and provides high recall and almost perfect precision in the resultant database. The method is fully automated except for one human-assisted step, which typically requires just a few hours of human labor. The method builds on top of natural language processing and large general language models but can work with almost any such model. The language models GPT-3/3.5, bart and DeBERTaV3 are evaluated here for comparison. We provide a detailed detailed analysis of the methods performance in extracting bulk modulus data, obtaining up to 90% precision at 96% recall, depending on the amount of human effort involved. We then demonstrate the methods broader effectiveness by developing a database of critical cooling rates for metallic glasses. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient require novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Methods based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) became a ubiquitous tool in generative modeling. However, they are mostly limited to Gaussian and discrete diffusion processes. We propose Star-Shaped Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (SS-DDPM), a model with a non-Markovian diffusion-like noising process. In the case of Gaussian distributions, this model is equivalent to Markovian DDPMs. However, it can be defined and applied with arbitrary noising distributions, and admits efficient training and sampling algorithms for a wide range of distributions that lie in the exponential family. We provide a simple recipe for designing diffusion-like models with distributions like Beta, von Mises--Fisher, Dirichlet, Wishart and others, which can be especially useful when data lies on a constrained manifold such as the unit sphere, the space of positive semi-definite matrices, the probabilistic simplex, etc. We evaluate the model in different settings and find it competitive even on image data, where Beta SS-DDPM achieves results comparable to a Gaussian DDPM. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
