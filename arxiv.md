        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In rectangular-target pointing, movement angles towards targets are known to affect error rates. When designers determine target sizes, however, they would not know the frequencies of cursor-approaching directions for each target. Thus, assuming that there are unbiasedly various angles, we derived models to predict error rates depending only on the target width and height. We conducted two crowdsourced experiments: a cyclic pointing task with a predefined movement angle and a multi-directional pointing task. The shuffle-split cross-validation with 60% training data showed R^2 &gt; 0.81, MAE &lt; 1.3%, and RMSE &lt; 2.1%, suggesting good prediction accuracy even for predicting untested target sizes when designers newly set UI elements. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Arabic language lacks semantic datasets and sense inventories. The most common semantically-labeled dataset for Arabic is the ArabGlossBERT, a relatively small dataset that consists of 167K context-gloss pairs (about 60K positive and 107K negative pairs), collected from Arabic dictionaries. This paper presents an enrichment to the ArabGlossBERT dataset, by augmenting it using (Arabic-English-Arabic) machine back-translation. Augmentation increased the dataset size to 352K pairs (149K positive and 203K negative pairs). We measure the impact of augmentation using different data configurations to fine-tune BERT on target sense verification (TSV) task. Overall, the accuracy ranges between 78% to 84% for different data configurations. Although our approach performed at par with the baseline, we did observe some improvements for some POS tags in some experiments. Furthermore, our fine-tuned models are trained on a larger dataset covering larger vocabulary and contexts. We provide an in-depth analysis of the accuracy for each part-of-speech (POS). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural fields, also known as implicit neural representations, have emerged as a powerful means to represent complex signals of various modalities. Based on this Dupont et al. (2022) introduce a framework that views neural fields as data, termed *functa*, and proposes to do deep learning directly on this dataset of neural fields. In this work, we show that the proposed framework faces limitations when scaling up to even moderately complex datasets such as CIFAR-10. We then propose *spatial functa*, which overcome these limitations by using spatially arranged latent representations of neural fields, thereby allowing us to scale up the approach to ImageNet-1k at 256x256 resolution. We demonstrate competitive performance to Vision Transformers (Steiner et al., 2022) on classification and Latent Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) on image generation respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many studies have attempted to solve the problem of missing data using various approaches. Among them, Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN) was first used to impute data with Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) and good results were obtained. Subsequent studies have attempted to combine various approaches to address some of its limitations. ClueGAIN is first proposed in this study, which introduces transfer learning into GAIN to solve the problem of poor imputation performance in high missing rate data sets. ClueGAIN can also be used to measure the similarity between data sets to explore their potential connections. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 can carry fluent, multi-turn conversations out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for chatbot design. Further, designers can improve LLM chatbot utterances by prepending textual prompts -- instructions and examples of desired interactions -- to its inputs. However, prompt-based improvements can be brittle; designers face challenges systematically understanding how a prompt strategy might impact the unfolding of subsequent conversations across users. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Conversation Regression Testing. Based on sample conversations with a baseline chatbot, Conversation Regression Testing tracks how conversational errors persist or are resolved by applying different prompt strategies. We embody this technique in an interactive design tool, BotDesigner, that lets designers identify archetypal errors across multiple conversations; shows common threads of conversation using a graph visualization; and highlights the effects of prompt changes across bot design iterations. A pilot evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of both the concept of regression testing and the functionalities of BotDesigner for chatbot designers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Selecting a suitable training dataset is crucial for both general-domain (e.g., GPT-3) and domain-specific (e.g., Codex) language models (LMs). We formalize this data selection problem as selecting a subset of a large raw unlabeled dataset to match a desired target distribution, given some unlabeled target samples. Due to the large scale and dimensionality of the raw text data, existing methods use simple heuristics to select data that are similar to a high-quality reference corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), or leverage experts to manually curate data. Instead, we extend the classic importance resampling approach used in low-dimensions for LM data selection. Crucially, we work in a reduced feature space to make importance weight estimation tractable over the space of text. To determine an appropriate feature space, we first show that KL reduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between selected data and the target in a feature space, has high correlation with average accuracy on 8 downstream tasks (r=0.89) when computed with simple n-gram features. From this observation, we present Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an efficient and scalable algorithm that estimates importance weights in a reduced feature space (e.g., n-gram features in our instantiation) and selects data with importance resampling according to these weights. When training general-domain models (target is Wikipedia + books), DSIR improves over random selection and heuristic filtering baselines by 2--2.5% on the GLUE benchmark. When performing continued pretraining towards a specific domain, DSIR performs comparably to expert curated data across 8 target distributions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have attracted attention in recent years as innovative generative models. In this paper, we investigate whether a diffusion model is resistant to a membership inference attack, which evaluates the privacy leakage of a machine learning model. We primarily discuss the diffusion model from the standpoints of comparison with a generative adversarial network (GAN) as conventional models and hyperparameters unique to the diffusion model, i.e., time steps, sampling steps, and sampling variances. We conduct extensive experiments with DDIM as a diffusion model and DCGAN as a GAN on the CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets in both white-box and black-box settings and then confirm if the diffusion model is comparably resistant to a membership inference attack as GAN. Next, we demonstrate that the impact of time steps is significant and intermediate steps in a noise schedule are the most vulnerable to the attack. We also found two key insights through further analysis. First, we identify that DDIM is vulnerable to the attack for small sample sizes instead of achieving a lower FID. Second, sampling steps in hyperparameters are important for resistance to the attack, whereas the impact of sampling variances is quite limited. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, a novel framework is established for uncertainty quantification via information bottleneck (IB-UQ) for scientific machine learning tasks, including deep neural network (DNN) regression and neural operator learning (DeepONet). Specifically, we first employ the General Incompressible-Flow Networks (GIN) model to learn a "wide" distribution fromnoisy observation data. Then, following the information bottleneck objective, we learn a stochastic map from input to some latent representation that can be used to predict the output. A tractable variational bound on the IB objective is constructed with a normalizing flow reparameterization. Hence, we can optimize the objective using the stochastic gradient descent method. IB-UQ can provide both mean and variance in the label prediction by explicitly modeling the representation variables. Compared to most DNN regression methods and the deterministic DeepONet, the proposed model can be trained on noisy data and provide accurate predictions with reliable uncertainty estimates on unseen noisy data. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed IB-UQ framework via several representative examples, including discontinuous function regression, real-world dataset regression and learning nonlinear operators for diffusion-reaction partial differential equation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Over the past decade, predictive language modeling for code has proven to be a valuable tool for enabling new forms of automation for developers. More recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose "large language models", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text spanning code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end-users. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent research has shown it is possible to perform zero-shot classification tasks by training a classifier with synthetic data generated by a diffusion model. However, the performance of this approach is still inferior to that of recent vision-language models. It has been suggested that the reason for this is a domain gap between the synthetic and real data. In our work, we show that this domain gap is not the main issue, and that diversity in the synthetic dataset is more important. We propose a \textit{bag of tricks} to improve diversity and are able to achieve performance on par with one of the vision-language models, CLIP. More importantly, this insight allows us to endow zero-shot classification capabilities on any classification model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Language Models are the core for almost any Natural Language Processing system nowadays. One of their particularities is their contextualized representations, a game changer feature when a disambiguation between word senses is necessary. In this paper we aim to explore to what extent language models are capable of discerning among senses at inference time. We performed this analysis by prompting commonly used Languages Models such as BERT or RoBERTa to perform the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We leverage the relation between word senses and domains, and cast WSD as a textual entailment problem, where the different hypothesis refer to the domains of the word senses. Our results show that this approach is indeed effective, close to supervised systems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data for electrochemical systems often consists of defining an Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) using expert knowledge and then optimizing the model parameters to deconvolute various resistance, capacitive, inductive, or diffusion responses. For small data sets, this procedure can be conducted manually; however, it is not feasible to manually define a proper ECM for extensive data sets with a wide range of EIS responses. Automatic identification of an ECM would substantially accelerate the analysis of large sets of EIS data. Here, we showcase machine learning methods developed during the BatteryDEV hackathon to classify the ECMs of 9,300 EIS measurements provided by QuantumScape. The best-performing approach is a gradient-boosted tree model utilizing a library to automatically generate features, followed by a random forest model using the raw spectral data. A convolutional neural network using boolean images of Nyquist representations is presented as an alternative, although it achieves a lower accuracy. We publish the data and open source the associated code. The approaches described in this article can serve as benchmarks for further studies. A key remaining challenge is that the labels contain uncertainty and human bias, underlined by the performance of the trained models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Artificial intelligence has great potential for accelerating the design and engineering of chemical processes. Recently, we have shown that transformer-based language models can learn to auto-complete chemical process flowsheets using the SFILES 2.0 string notation. Also, we showed that language translation models can be used to translate Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) into Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs). However, artificial intelligence methods require big data and flowsheet data is currently limited. To mitigate this challenge of limited data, we propose a new data augmentation methodology for flowsheet data that is represented in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We show that the proposed data augmentation improves the performance of artificial intelligence-based process design models. In our case study flowsheet data augmentation improved the prediction uncertainty of the flowsheet autocompletion model by 14.7%. In the future, our flowsheet data augmentation can be used for other machine learning algorithms on chemical process flowsheets that are based on SFILES notation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The last decades are marked by massive and diverse image data, which shows increasingly high resolution and quality. However, some images we obtained may be corrupted, affecting the perception and the application of downstream tasks. A generic method for generating a high-quality image from the degraded one is in demand. In this paper, we present a novel GAN inversion framework that utilizes the powerful generative ability of StyleGAN-XL for this problem. To ease the inversion challenge with StyleGAN-XL, Clustering \&amp; Regularize Inversion (CRI) is proposed. Specifically, the latent space is firstly divided into finer-grained sub-spaces by clustering. Instead of initializing the inversion with the average latent vector, we approximate a centroid latent vector from the clusters, which generates an image close to the input image. Then, an offset with a regularization term is introduced to keep the inverted latent vector within a certain range. We validate our CRI scheme on multiple restoration tasks (i.e., inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution) of complex natural images, and show preferable quantitative and qualitative results. We further demonstrate our technique is robust in terms of data and different GAN models. To our best knowledge, we are the first to adopt StyleGAN-XL for generating high-quality natural images from diverse degraded inputs. Code is available at https://github.com/Booooooooooo/CRI. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Systematic reviews are comprehensive reviews of the literature for a highly focused research question. These reviews are often treated as the highest form of evidence in evidence-based medicine, and are the key strategy to answer research questions in the medical field. To create a high-quality systematic review, complex Boolean queries are often constructed to retrieve studies for the review topic. However, it often takes a long time for systematic review researchers to construct a high quality systematic review Boolean query, and often the resulting queries are far from effective. Poor queries may lead to biased or invalid reviews, because they missed to retrieve key evidence, or to extensive increase in review costs, because they retrieved too many irrelevant studies. Recent advances in Transformer-based generative models have shown great potential to effectively follow instructions from users and generate answers based on the instructions being made. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the latest of such models, ChatGPT, in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. Through a number of extensive experiments on standard test collections for the task, we find that ChatGPT is capable of generating queries that lead to high search precision, although trading-off this for recall. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. The ability of ChatGPT to follow complex instructions and generate queries with high precision makes it a valuable tool for researchers conducting systematic reviews, particularly for rapid reviews where time is a constraint and often trading-off higher precision for lower recall is acceptable. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities and physiological signals from facial video without any contact, has great potential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare and affective computing). Recent deep learning approaches focus on mining subtle rPPG clues using convolutional neural networks with limited spatio-temporal receptive fields, which neglect the long-range spatio-temporal perception and interaction for rPPG modeling. In this paper, we propose two end-to-end video transformer based architectures, namely PhysFormer and PhysFormer++, to adaptively aggregate both local and global spatio-temporal features for rPPG representation enhancement. As key modules in PhysFormer, the temporal difference transformers first enhance the quasi-periodic rPPG features with temporal difference guided global attention, and then refine the local spatio-temporal representation against interference. To better exploit the temporal contextual and periodic rPPG clues, we also extend the PhysFormer to the two-pathway SlowFast based PhysFormer++ with temporal difference periodic and cross-attention transformers. Furthermore, we propose the label distribution learning and a curriculum learning inspired dynamic constraint in frequency domain, which provide elaborate supervisions for PhysFormer and PhysFormer++ and alleviate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. Unlike most transformer networks needed pretraining from large-scale datasets, the proposed PhysFormer family can be easily trained from scratch on rPPG datasets, which makes it promising as a novel transformer baseline for the rPPG community. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generation of graphs is a major challenge for real-world tasks that require understanding the complex nature of their non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have achieved notable success in graph generation recently, they are ill-suited for modeling the structural information of graphs since learning to denoise the noisy samples does not explicitly capture the graph topology. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel generative process that models the topology of graphs by predicting the destination of the process. Specifically, we design the generative process as a mixture of diffusion processes conditioned on the endpoint in the data distribution, which drives the process toward the probable destination. Further, we introduce new training objectives for learning to predict the destination, and discuss the advantages of our generative framework that can explicitly model the graph topology and exploit the inductive bias of the data. Through extensive experimental validation on general graph and 2D/3D molecular graph generation tasks, we show that our method outperforms previous generative models, generating graphs with correct topology with both continuous and discrete features. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human motion prediction is a classical problem in computer vision and computer graphics, which has a wide range of practical applications. Previous effects achieve great empirical performance based on an encoding-decoding fashion. The methods of this fashion work by first encoding previous motions to latent representations and then decoding the latent representations into predicted motions. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including complicated loss constraints, cumbersome training processes, and scarce switch of different categories of motions in prediction. In this paper, to address the above issues, we jump out of the foregoing fashion and propose a novel framework from a new perspective. Specifically, our framework works in a denoising diffusion style. In the training stage, we learn a motion diffusion model that generates motions from random noise. In the inference stage, with a denoising procedure, we make motion prediction conditioning on observed motions to output more continuous and controllable predictions. The proposed framework enjoys promising algorithmic properties, which only needs one loss in optimization and is trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, it accomplishes the switch of different categories of motions effectively, which is significant in realistic tasks, \textit{e.g.}, the animation task. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed framework.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-to-image models, which can generate high-quality images based on textual input, have recently enabled various content-creation tools. Despite significantly affecting a wide range of downstream applications, the distributions of these generated images are still not fully understood, especially when it comes to the potential stereotypical attributes of different genders. In this work, we propose a paradigm (Gender Presentation Differences) that utilizes fine-grained self-presentation attributes to study how gender is presented differently in text-to-image models. By probing gender indicators in the input text (e.g., "a woman" or "a man"), we quantify the frequency differences of presentation-centric attributes (e.g., "a shirt" and "a dress") through human annotation and introduce a novel metric: GEP. Furthermore, we propose an automatic method to estimate such differences. The automatic GEP metric based on our approach yields a higher correlation with human annotations than that based on existing CLIP scores, consistently across three state-of-the-art text-to-image models. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our metrics in the context of gender stereotypes related to occupations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Temperature scaling is a popular technique for tuning the sharpness of a model distribution. It is used extensively for sampling likely generations and calibrating model uncertainty, and even features as a controllable parameter to many large language models in deployment. However, autoregressive models rely on myopic temperature scaling that greedily optimizes the next token. To address this, we propose Long Horizon Temperature Scaling (LHTS), a novel approach for sampling from temperature-scaled joint distributions. LHTS is compatible with all likelihood-based models, and optimizes for the long-horizon likelihood of samples. We derive a temperature-dependent LHTS objective, and show that fine-tuning a model on a range of temperatures produces a single model capable of generation with a controllable long-horizon temperature parameter. We experiment with LHTS on image diffusion models and character/language autoregressive models, demonstrating advantages over myopic temperature scaling in likelihood and sample quality, and showing improvements in accuracy on a multiple choice analogy task by $10\%$. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: VAEs, or variational autoencoders, are autoencoders that explicitly learn the distribution of the input image space rather than assuming no prior information about the distribution. This allows it to classify similar samples close to each other in the latent space's distribution. VAEs classically assume the latent space is normally distributed, though many distribution priors work, and they encode this assumption through a K-L divergence term in the loss function. While VAEs learn the distribution of the latent space and naturally make each dimension in the latent space as disjoint from the others as possible, they do not group together similar features -- the image space feature represented by one unit of the representation layer does not necessarily have high correlation with the feature represented by a neighboring unit of the representation layer. This makes it difficult to interpret VAEs since the representation layer is not structured in a way that is easy for humans to parse. We aim to make a more interpretable VAE by partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets of units. Partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets of interconnected units yields a prior that features of the input space to this new VAE, which we call a partition VAE or PVAE, are grouped together by correlation -- for example, if our image space were the space of all ping ping game images (a somewhat complex image space we use to test our architecture) then we would hope the partitions in the representation layer each learned some large feature of the image like the characteristics of the ping pong table or the characteristics and position of the players or the ball. We also add to the PVAE a cost-saving measure: subresolution. Because we do not have access to GPU training environments for long periods of time and Google Colab Pro costs money, we attempt to decrease the complexity of the PVAE by outputting an image with dimensions scaled down from the input image by a constant factor, thus forcing the model to output a smaller version of the image. We then increase the resolution to calculate loss and train by interpolating through neighboring pixels. We train a tuned PVAE on MNIST and Sports10 to test its effectiveness. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Spatially resolved transcriptomics brings exciting breakthroughs to single-cell analysis by providing physical locations along with gene expression. However, as a cost of the extremely high spatial resolution, the cellular level spatial transcriptomic data suffer significantly from missing values. While a standard solution is to perform imputation on the missing values, most existing methods either overlook spatial information or only incorporate localized spatial context without the ability to capture long-range spatial information. Using multi-head self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding, transformer models can readily grasp the relationship between tokens and encode location information. In this paper, by treating single cells as spatial tokens, we study how to leverage transformers to facilitate spatial tanscriptomics imputation. In particular, investigate the following two key questions: (1) $\textit{how to encode spatial information of cells in transformers}$, and (2) $\textit{ how to train a transformer for transcriptomic imputation}$. By answering these two questions, we present a transformer-based imputation framework, SpaFormer, for cellular-level spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms on three large-scale datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Medical Image Segmentation is a useful application for medical image analysis including detecting diseases and abnormalities in imaging modalities such as MRI, CT etc. Deep learning has proven to be promising for this task but usually has a low accuracy because of the lack of appropriate publicly available annotated or segmented medical datasets. In addition, the datasets that are available may have a different texture because of different dosage values or scanner properties than the images that need to be segmented. This paper presents a StyleGAN-driven approach for segmenting publicly available large medical datasets by using readily available extremely small annotated datasets in similar modalities. The approach involves augmenting the small segmented dataset and eliminating texture differences between the two datasets. The dataset is augmented by being passed through six different StyleGANs that are trained on six different style images taken from the large non-annotated dataset we want to segment. Specifically, style transfer is used to augment the training dataset. The annotations of the training dataset are hence combined with the textures of the non-annotated dataset to generate new anatomically sound images. The augmented dataset is then used to train a U-Net segmentation network which displays a significant improvement in the segmentation accuracy in segmenting the large non-annotated dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) have obtained lots of research interest for immersive experiences. Although ODIs require extremely high resolution to capture details of the entire scene, the resolutions of most ODIs are insufficient. Previous methods attempt to solve this issue by image super-resolution (SR) on equirectangular projection (ERP) images. However, they omit geometric properties of ERP in the degradation process, and their models can hardly generalize to real ERP images. In this paper, we propose Fisheye downsampling, which mimics the real-world imaging process and synthesizes more realistic low-resolution samples. Then we design a distortion-aware Transformer (OSRT) to modulate ERP distortions continuously and self-adaptively. Without a cumbersome process, OSRT outperforms previous methods by about 0.2dB on PSNR. Moreover, we propose a convenient data augmentation strategy, which synthesizes pseudo ERP images from plain images. This simple strategy can alleviate the over-fitting problem of large networks and significantly boost the performance of ODISR. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our OSRT.
