### [Transformers for End-to-End InfoSec Tasks: A Feasibility Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02666)
In this paper, we assess the viability of transformer models in end-to-end InfoSec settings, in which no intermediate feature representations or processing steps occur outside the model. We implement transformer models for two distinct InfoSec data formats - specifically URLs and PE files - in a novel end-to-end approach, and explore a variety of architectural designs, training regimes, and experimental settings to determine the ingredients necessary for performant detection models. We show that in contrast to conventional transformers trained on more standard NLP-related tasks, our URL transformer model requires a different training approach to reach high performance levels. Specifically, we show that 1) pre-training on a massive corpus of unlabeled URL data for an auto-regressive task does not readily transfer to binary classification of malicious or benign URLs, but 2) that using an auxiliary auto-regressive loss improves performance when training from scratch. We introduce a method for mixed objective optimization, which dynamically balances contributions from both loss terms so that neither one of them dominates. We show that this method yields quantitative evaluation metrics comparable to that of several top-performing benchmark classifiers. Unlike URLs, binary executables contain longer and more distributed sequences of information-rich bytes. To accommodate such lengthy byte sequences, we introduce additional context length into the transformer by providing its self-attention layers with an adaptive span similar to Sukhbaatar et al. We demonstrate that this approach performs comparably to well-established malware detection models on benchmark PE file datasets, but also point out the need for further exploration into model improvements in scalability and compute efficiency. 

### [Enabling and Accelerating Dynamic Vision Transformer Inference for  Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02687)
Many state-of-the-art deep learning models for computer vision tasks are based on the transformer architecture. Such models can be computationally expensive and are typically statically set to meet the deployment scenario. However, in real-time applications, the resources available for every inference can vary considerably and be smaller than what state-of-the-art models use. We can use dynamic models to adapt the model execution to meet real-time application resource constraints. While prior dynamic work has primarily minimized resource utilization for less complex input images while maintaining accuracy and focused on CNNs and early transformer models such as BERT, we adapt vision transformers to meet system dynamic resource constraints, independent of the input image. We find that unlike early transformer models, recent state-of-the-art vision transformers heavily rely on convolution layers. We show that pretrained models are fairly resilient to skipping computation in the convolution and self-attention layers, enabling us to create a low-overhead system for dynamic real-time inference without additional training. Finally, we create a optimized accelerator for these dynamic vision transformers in a 5nm technology. The PE array occupies 2.26mm$^2$ and is 17 times faster than a NVIDIA TITAN V GPU for state-of-the-art transformer-based models for semantic segmentation. 

### [LUNA: Language Understanding with Number Augmentations on Transformers  via Number Plugins and Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02691)
Transformers are widely used in NLP tasks. However, current approaches to leveraging transformers to understand language expose one weak spot: Number understanding. In some scenarios, numbers frequently occur, especially in semi-structured data like tables. But current approaches to rich-number tasks with transformer-based language models abandon or lose some of the numeracy information - e.g., breaking numbers into sub-word tokens - which leads to many number-related errors. In this paper, we propose the LUNA framework which improves the numerical reasoning and calculation capabilities of transformer-based language models. With the number plugin of NumTok and NumBed, LUNA represents each number as a whole to model input. With number pre-training, including regression loss and model distillation, LUNA bridges the gap between number and vocabulary embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly injects numeracy capability into language models using Number Plugins. Besides evaluating toy models on toy tasks, we evaluate LUNA on three large-scale transformer models (RoBERTa, BERT, TabBERT) over three different downstream tasks (TATQA, TabFact, CrediTrans), and observe the performances of language models are constantly improved by LUNA. The augmented models also improve the official baseline of TAT-QA (EM: 50.15 -> 59.58) and achieve SOTA performance on CrediTrans (F1 = 86.17). 

### [Semantic-aware Message Broadcasting for Efficient Unsupervised Domain  Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02739)
Vision transformer has demonstrated great potential in abundant vision tasks. However, it also inevitably suffers from poor generalization capability when the distribution shift occurs in testing (i.e., out-of-distribution data). To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel method, Semantic-aware Message Broadcasting (SAMB), which enables more informative and flexible feature alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Particularly, we study the attention module in the vision transformer and notice that the alignment space using one global class token lacks enough flexibility, where it interacts information with all image tokens in the same manner but ignores the rich semantics of different regions. In this paper, we aim to improve the richness of the alignment features by enabling semantic-aware adaptive message broadcasting. Particularly, we introduce a group of learned group tokens as nodes to aggregate the global information from all image tokens, but encourage different group tokens to adaptively focus on the message broadcasting to different semantic regions. In this way, our message broadcasting encourages the group tokens to learn more informative and diverse information for effective domain alignment. Moreover, we systematically study the effects of adversarial-based feature alignment (ADA) and pseudo-label based self-training (PST) on UDA. We find that one simple two-stage training strategy with the cooperation of ADA and PST can further improve the adaptation capability of the vision transformer. Extensive experiments on DomainNet, OfficeHome, and VisDA-2017 demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for UDA. 

### [UniGeo: Unifying Geometry Logical Reasoning via Reformulating  Mathematical Expression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02746)
Geometry problem solving is a well-recognized testbed for evaluating the high-level multi-modal reasoning capability of deep models. In most existing works, two main geometry problems: calculation and proving, are usually treated as two specific tasks, hindering a deep model to unify its reasoning capability on multiple math tasks. However, in essence, these two tasks have similar problem representations and overlapped math knowledge which can improve the understanding and reasoning ability of a deep model on both two tasks. Therefore, we construct a large-scale Unified Geometry problem benchmark, UniGeo, which contains 4,998 calculation problems and 9,543 proving problems. Each proving problem is annotated with a multi-step proof with reasons and mathematical expressions. The proof can be easily reformulated as a proving sequence that shares the same formats with the annotated program sequence for calculation problems. Naturally, we also present a unified multi-task Geometric Transformer framework, Geoformer, to tackle calculation and proving problems simultaneously in the form of sequence generation, which finally shows the reasoning ability can be improved on both two tasks by unifying formulation. Furthermore, we propose a Mathematical Expression Pretraining (MEP) method that aims to predict the mathematical expressions in the problem solution, thus improving the Geoformer model. Experiments on the UniGeo demonstrate that our proposed Geoformer obtains state-of-the-art performance by outperforming task-specific model NGS with over 5.6% and 3.2% accuracies on calculation and proving problems, respectively. 

### [DiffusionInst: Diffusion Model for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02773)
Recently, diffusion frameworks have achieved comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art image generation models. Researchers are curious about its variants in discriminative tasks because of its powerful noise-to-image denoising pipeline. This paper proposes DiffusionInst, a novel framework that represents instances as instance-aware filters and formulates instance segmentation as a noise-to-filter denoising process. The model is trained to reverse the noisy groundtruth without any inductive bias from RPN. During inference, it takes a randomly generated filter as input and outputs mask in one-step or multi-step denoising. Extensive experimental results on COCO and LVIS show that DiffusionInst achieves competitive performance compared to existing instance segmentation models. We hope our work could serve as a simple yet effective baseline, which could inspire designing more efficient diffusion frameworks for challenging discriminative tasks. Our code is available in https://github.com/chenhaoxing/DiffusionInst. 

### [A K-variate Time Series Is Worth K Words: Evolution of the Vanilla  Transformer Architecture for Long-term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02789)
Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a fundamental problem in numerous real-world applications. Recently, Transformer has become the de facto solution for MTSF, especially for the long-term cases. However, except for the one forward operation, the basic configurations in existing MTSF Transformer architectures were barely carefully verified. In this study, we point out that the current tokenization strategy in MTSF Transformer architectures ignores the token uniformity inductive bias of Transformers. Therefore, the vanilla MTSF transformer struggles to capture details in time series and presents inferior performance. Based on this observation, we make a series of evolution on the basic architecture of the vanilla MTSF transformer. We vary the flawed tokenization strategy, along with the decoder structure and embeddings. Surprisingly, the evolved simple transformer architecture is highly effective, which successfully avoids the over-smoothing phenomena in the vanilla MTSF transformer, achieves a more detailed and accurate prediction, and even substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformers that are well-designed for MTSF. 

### [Event-based Monocular Dense Depth Estimation with Recurrent Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02791)
Event cameras, offering high temporal resolutions and high dynamic ranges, have brought a new perspective to address common challenges (e.g., motion blur and low light) in monocular depth estimation. However, how to effectively exploit the sparse spatial information and rich temporal cues from asynchronous events remains a challenging endeavor. To this end, we propose a novel event-based monocular depth estimator with recurrent transformers, namely EReFormer, which is the first pure transformer with a recursive mechanism to process continuous event streams. Technically, for spatial modeling, a novel transformer-based encoder-decoder with a spatial transformer fusion module is presented, having better global context information modeling capabilities than CNN-based methods. For temporal modeling, we design a gate recurrent vision transformer unit that introduces a recursive mechanism into transformers, improving temporal modeling capabilities while alleviating the expensive GPU memory cost. The experimental results show that our EReFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a margin on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We hope that our work will attract further research to develop stunning transformers in the event-based vision community. Our open-source code can be found in the supplemental material. 

### [DiffuPose: Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation via Denoising Diffusion  Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02796)
Thanks to the development of 2D keypoint detectors, monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) via 2D-to-3D uplifting approaches have achieved remarkable improvements. Still, monocular 3D HPE is a challenging problem due to the inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. To handle this problem, many previous works exploit temporal information to mitigate such difficulties. However, there are many real-world applications where frame sequences are not accessible. This paper focuses on reconstructing a 3D pose from a single 2D keypoint detection. Rather than exploiting temporal information, we alleviate the depth ambiguity by generating multiple 3D pose candidates which can be mapped to an identical 2D keypoint. We build a novel diffusion-based framework to effectively sample diverse 3D poses from an off-the-shelf 2D detector. By considering the correlation between human joints by replacing the conventional denoising U-Net with graph convolutional network, our approach accomplishes further performance improvements. We evaluate our method on the widely adopted Human3.6M and HumanEva-I datasets. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to prove the efficacy of the proposed method, and they confirm that our model outperforms state-of-the-art multi-hypothesis 3D HPE methods. 

### [Diffusion Video Autoencoders: Toward Temporally Consistent Face Video  Editing via Disentangled Video Encoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02802)
Inspired by the impressive performance of recent face image editing methods, several studies have been naturally proposed to extend these methods to the face video editing task. One of the main challenges here is temporal consistency among edited frames, which is still unresolved. To this end, we propose a novel face video editing framework based on diffusion autoencoders that can successfully extract the decomposed features - for the first time as a face video editing model - of identity and motion from a given video. This modeling allows us to edit the video by simply manipulating the temporally invariant feature to the desired direction for the consistency. Another unique strength of our model is that, since our model is based on diffusion models, it can satisfy both reconstruction and edit capabilities at the same time, and is robust to corner cases in wild face videos (e.g. occluded faces) unlike the existing GAN-based methods. 

### [Pretrained Diffusion Models for Unified Human Motion Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02837)
Generative modeling of human motion has broad applications in computer animation, virtual reality, and robotics. Conventional approaches develop separate models for different motion synthesis tasks, and typically use a model of a small size to avoid overfitting the scarce data available in each setting. It remains an open question whether developing a single unified model is feasible, which may 1) benefit the acquirement of novel skills by combining skills learned from multiple tasks, and 2) help in increasing the model capacity without overfitting by combining multiple data sources. Unification is challenging because 1) it involves diverse control signals as well as targets of varying granularity, and 2) motion datasets may use different skeletons and default poses. In this paper, we present MoFusion, a framework for unified motion synthesis. MoFusion employs a Transformer backbone to ease the inclusion of diverse control signals via cross attention, and pretrains the backbone as a diffusion model to support multi-granularity synthesis ranging from motion completion of a body part to whole-body motion generation. It uses a learnable adapter to accommodate the differences between the default skeletons used by the pretraining and the fine-tuning data. Empirical results show that pretraining is vital for scaling the model size without overfitting, and demonstrate MoFusion's potential in various tasks, e.g., text-to-motion, motion completion, and zero-shot mixing of multiple control signals.

### [Video Object of Interest Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02871)
In this work, we present a new computer vision task named video object of interest segmentation (VOIS). Given a video and a target image of interest, our objective is to simultaneously segment and track all objects in the video that are relevant to the target image. This problem combines the traditional video object segmentation task with an additional image indicating the content that users are concerned with. Since no existing dataset is perfectly suitable for this new task, we specifically construct a large-scale dataset called LiveVideos, which contains 2418 pairs of target images and live videos with instance-level annotations. In addition, we propose a transformer-based method for this task. We revisit Swin Transformer and design a dual-path structure to fuse video and image features. Then, a transformer decoder is employed to generate object proposals for segmentation and tracking from the fused features. Extensive experiments on LiveVideos dataset show the superiority of our proposed method. 

### [M-VADER: A Model for Diffusion with Multimodal Context](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02936)
We introduce M-VADER: a diffusion model (DM) for image generation where the output can be specified using arbitrary combinations of images and text. We show how M-VADER enables the generation of images specified using combinations of image and text, and combinations of multiple images. Previously, a number of successful DM image generation algorithms have been introduced that make it possible to specify the output image using a text prompt. Inspired by the success of those models, and led by the notion that language was already developed to describe the elements of visual contexts that humans find most important, we introduce an embedding model closely related to a vision-language model. Specifically, we introduce the embedding model S-MAGMA: a 13 billion parameter multimodal decoder combining components from an autoregressive vision-language model MAGMA and biases finetuned for semantic search. 

### [Simple Baseline for Weather Forecasting Using Spatiotemporal Context  Aggregation Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02952)
Traditional weather forecasting relies on domain expertise and computationally intensive numerical simulation systems. Recently, with the development of a data-driven approach, weather forecasting based on deep learning has been receiving attention. Deep learning-based weather forecasting has made stunning progress, from various backbone studies using CNN, RNN, and Transformer to training strategies using weather observations datasets with auxiliary inputs. All of this progress has contributed to the field of weather forecasting; however, many elements and complex structures of deep learning models prevent us from reaching physical interpretations. This paper proposes a SImple baseline with a spatiotemporal context Aggregation Network (SIANet) that achieved state-of-the-art in 4 parts of 5 benchmarks of W4C22. This simple but efficient structure uses only satellite images and CNNs in an end-to-end fashion without using a multi-model ensemble or fine-tuning. This simplicity of SIANet can be used as a solid baseline that can be easily applied in weather forecasting using deep learning. 

### [SDM: Spatial Diffusion Model for Large Hole Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02963)
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made great success in image inpainting yet still have difficulties tackling large missing regions. In contrast, iterative algorithms, such as autoregressive and denoising diffusion models, have to be deployed with massive computing resources for decent effect. To overcome the respective limitations, we present a novel spatial diffusion model (SDM) that uses a few iterations to gradually deliver informative pixels to the entire image, largely enhancing the inference efficiency. Also, thanks to the proposed decoupled probabilistic modeling and spatial diffusion scheme, our method achieves high-quality large-hole completion. On multiple benchmarks, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance. Code is released at https://github.com/fenglinglwb/SDM. 

### [Open World DETR: Transformer based Open World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02969)
Open world object detection aims at detecting objects that are absent in the object classes of the training data as unknown objects without explicit supervision. Furthermore, the exact classes of the unknown objects must be identified without catastrophic forgetting of the previous known classes when the corresponding annotations of unknown objects are given incrementally. In this paper, we propose a two-stage training approach named Open World DETR for open world object detection based on Deformable DETR. In the first stage, we pre-train a model on the current annotated data to detect objects from the current known classes, and concurrently train an additional binary classifier to classify predictions into foreground or background classes. This helps the model to build an unbiased feature representations that can facilitate the detection of unknown classes in subsequent process. In the second stage, we fine-tune the class-specific components of the model with a multi-view self-labeling strategy and a consistency constraint. Furthermore, we alleviate catastrophic forgetting when the annotations of the unknown classes becomes available incrementally by using knowledge distillation and exemplar replay. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art open world object detection methods by a large margin. 

### [Denoising diffusion probabilistic models for probabilistic energy  forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02977)
Scenario-based probabilistic forecasts have become a vital tool to equip decision-makers to address the uncertain nature of renewable energies. This paper presents a recent promising deep learning generative approach: denoising diffusion probabilistic models. It is a class of latent variable models that have recently demonstrated impressive results in the computer vision community. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be a demonstration that they can generate high-quality samples of load, PV, or wind power time series that are crucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. Thus, we propose the first implementation of this model for energy forecasting using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. The results demonstrate that this approach is competitive with other state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and normalizing flows. 

### [Muscles in Action](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02978)
Small differences in a person's motion can engage drastically different muscles. While most visual representations of human activity are trained from video, people learn from multimodal experiences, including from the proprioception of their own muscles. We present a new visual perception task and dataset to model muscle activation in human activities from monocular video. Our Muscles in Action (MIA) dataset consists of 2 hours of synchronized video and surface electromyography (sEMG) data of subjects performing various exercises. Using this dataset, we learn visual representations that are predictive of muscle activation from monocular video. We present several models, including a transformer model, and measure their ability to generalize to new exercises and subjects. Putting muscles into computer vision systems will enable richer models of virtual humans, with applications in sports, fitness, and AR/VR. 

### [PRISM: Probabilistic Real-Time Inference in Spatial World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02988)
We introduce PRISM, a method for real-time filtering in a probabilistic generative model of agent motion and visual perception. Previous approaches either lack uncertainty estimates for the map and agent state, do not run in real-time, do not have a dense scene representation or do not model agent dynamics. Our solution reconciles all of these aspects. We start from a predefined state-space model which combines differentiable rendering and 6-DoF dynamics. Probabilistic inference in this model amounts to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and is intractable. We use a series of approximations to Bayesian inference to arrive at probabilistic map and state estimates. We take advantage of well-established methods and closed-form updates, preserving accuracy and enabling real-time capability. The proposed solution runs at 10Hz real-time and is similarly accurate to state-of-the-art SLAM in small to medium-sized indoor environments, with high-speed UAV and handheld camera agents (Blackbird, EuRoC and TUM-RGBD). 

### [SODA: A Natural Language Processing Package to Extract Social  Determinants of Health for Cancer Studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03000)
Objective: We aim to develop an open-source natural language processing (NLP) package, SODA (i.e., SOcial DeterminAnts), with pre-trained transformer models to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) for cancer patients, examine the generalizability of SODA to a new disease domain (i.e., opioid use), and evaluate the extraction rate of SDoH using cancer populations. 

### [GD-MAE: Generative Decoder for MAE Pre-training on LiDAR Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03010)
Despite the tremendous progress of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) in developing vision tasks such as image and video, exploring MAE in large-scale 3D point clouds remains challenging due to the inherent irregularity. In contrast to previous 3D MAE frameworks, which either design a complex decoder to infer masked information from maintained regions or adopt sophisticated masking strategies, we instead propose a much simpler paradigm. The core idea is to apply a \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{D}ecoder for MAE (GD-MAE) to automatically merges the surrounding context to restore the masked geometric knowledge in a hierarchical fusion manner. In doing so, our approach is free from introducing the heuristic design of decoders and enjoys the flexibility of exploring various masking strategies. The corresponding part costs less than \textbf{12\%} latency compared with conventional methods, while achieving better performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on several large-scale benchmarks: Waymo, KITTI, and ONCE. Consistent improvement on downstream detection tasks illustrates strong robustness and generalization capability. Not only our method reveals state-of-the-art results, but remarkably, we achieve comparable accuracy even with \textbf{20\%} of the labeled data on the Waymo dataset. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/Nightmare-n/GD-MAE}. 

### [Document-Level Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03013)
The task of automatic text summarization produces a concise and fluent text summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. Recent approaches to document-level summarization have seen significant improvements in recent years by using models based on the Transformer architecture. However, the quadratic memory and time complexities with respect to the sequence length make them very expensive to use, especially with long sequences, as required by document-level summarization. Our work addresses the problem of document-level summarization by studying how efficient Transformer techniques can be used to improve the automatic summarization of very long texts. In particular, we will use the arXiv dataset, consisting of several scientific papers and the corresponding abstracts, as baselines for this work. Then, we propose a novel retrieval-enhanced approach based on the architecture which reduces the cost of generating a summary of the entire document by processing smaller chunks. The results were below the baselines but suggest a more efficient memory a consumption and truthfulness. 

### [AbHE: All Attention-based Homography Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03029)
Homography estimation is a basic computer vision task, which aims to obtain the transformation from multi-view images for image alignment. Unsupervised learning homography estimation trains a convolution neural network for feature extraction and transformation matrix regression. While the state-of-the-art homography method is based on convolution neural networks, few work focuses on transformer which shows superiority in high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a strong-baseline model based on the Swin Transformer, which combines convolution neural network for local features and transformer module for global features. Moreover, a cross non-local layer is introduced to search the matched features within the feature maps coarsely.In the homography regression stage, we adopts an attention layer for the channels of correlation volume, which can drop out some weak correlation feature points. The experiment shows that in 8 Degree-of-Freedoms(DOFs) homography estimation our methods overperform the state-of-the-art method. 

### [IncepFormer: Efficient Inception Transformer with Pyramid Pooling for  Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03035)
Semantic segmentation usually benefits from global contexts, fine localisation information, multi-scale features, etc. To advance Transformer-based segmenters with these aspects, we present a simple yet powerful semantic segmentation architecture, termed as IncepFormer. IncepFormer has two critical contributions as following. First, it introduces a novel pyramid structured Transformer encoder which harvests global context and fine localisation features simultaneously. These features are concatenated and fed into a convolution layer for final per-pixel prediction. Second, IncepFormer integrates an Inception-like architecture with depth-wise convolutions, and a light-weight feed-forward module in each self-attention layer, efficiently obtaining rich local multi-scale object features. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our IncepFormer is superior to state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed, e.g., 1) our IncepFormer-S achieves 47.7% mIoU on ADE20K which outperforms the existing best method by 1% while only costs half parameters and fewer FLOPs. 2) Our IncepFormer-B finally achieves 82.0% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset with 39.6M parameters. Code is available:github.com/shendu0321/IncepFormer. 

### [Exploring the Critical Success Factors for Data Democratization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03059)
With the advent of the Data Age, organisations are constantly under pressure to pay attention to the diffusion of data skills, data responsibilities, and management of accessibility to data analysis tools for the technical as well as non-technical employees. As such, in recent times, organisations are focusing on data governance and management strategies such as data democratization. Data democratization is an ongoing process of broadening data access to employees to find, access, self-analyse, and share data by removing data silos. By democratizing organisational data, organisations attempt to ensure that employees can speak the language of data and empower them to use data efficiently to improve their business functionalities. This paper aims to identify the critical success factors for data democratization through an in-depth review of the literature. Based on the findings of the analysis, nine critical success factors were identified as successors of the data democratization strategy. 

### [Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03099)
Recent advances on text-to-image generation have witnessed the rise of diffusion models which act as powerful generative models. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit such latent variable models to capture the dependency among discrete words and meanwhile pursue complex visual-language alignment in image captioning. In this paper, we break the deeply rooted conventions in learning Transformer-based encoder-decoder, and propose a new diffusion model based paradigm tailored for image captioning, namely Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks (SCD-Net). Technically, for each input image, we first search the semantically relevant sentences via cross-modal retrieval model to convey the comprehensive semantic information. The rich semantics are further regarded as semantic prior to trigger the learning of Diffusion Transformer, which produces the output sentence in a diffusion process. In SCD-Net, multiple Diffusion Transformer structures are stacked to progressively strengthen the output sentence with better visional-language alignment and linguistical coherence in a cascaded manner. Furthermore, to stabilize the diffusion process, a new self-critical sequence training strategy is designed to guide the learning of SCD-Net with the knowledge of a standard autoregressive Transformer model. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate the promising potential of using diffusion models in the challenging image captioning task. Source code is available at \url{https://github.com/YehLi/xmodaler/tree/master/configs/image_caption/scdnet}. 

### [FacT: Factor-Tuning for Lightweight Adaptation on Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03145)
Recent work has explored the potential to adapt a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) by updating only a few parameters so as to improve storage efficiency, called parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL). Current PETL methods have shown that by tuning only 0.5% of the parameters, ViT can be adapted to downstream tasks with even better performance than full fine-tuning. In this paper, we aim to further promote the efficiency of PETL to meet the extreme storage constraint in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a tensorization-decomposition framework to store the weight increments, in which the weights of each ViT are tensorized into a single 3D tensor, and their increments are then decomposed into lightweight factors. In the fine-tuning process, only the factors need to be updated and stored, termed Factor-Tuning (FacT). On VTAB-1K benchmark, our method performs on par with NOAH, the state-of-the-art PETL method, while being 5x more parameter-efficient. We also present a tiny version that only uses 8K (0.01% of ViT's parameters) trainable parameters but outperforms full fine-tuning and many other PETL methods such as VPT and BitFit. In few-shot settings, FacT also beats all PETL baselines using the fewest parameters, demonstrating its strong capability in the low-data regime. 

### [Rethinking the Objectives of Vector-Quantized Tokenizers for Image  Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03185)
Vector-Quantized (VQ-based) generative models usually consist of two basic components, i.e., VQ tokenizers and generative transformers. Prior research focuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely examines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability of generative transformers. In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the generation. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ tokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation. Different from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance the two objectives. In the first phase, we propose a semantic-enhanced perceptual loss for better semantic compression. In the second phase, we fix the encoder and codebook, but enhance and finetune the decoder to achieve better details preservation. The proposed SeQ-GAN greatly improves VQ-based generative models and surpasses the GAN and Diffusion Models on both unconditional and conditional image generation. Our SeQ-GAN (364M) achieves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.25 and Inception Score (IS) of 140.9 on 256x256 ImageNet generation, a remarkable improvement over VIT-VQGAN (714M), which obtains 11.2 FID and 97.2 IS. 

### [ADIR: Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03221)
In recent years, denoising diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding image generation performance. The information on natural images captured by these models is useful for many image reconstruction applications, where the task is to restore a clean image from its degraded observations. In this work, we propose a conditional sampling scheme that exploits the prior learned by diffusion models while retaining agreement with the observations. We then combine it with a novel approach for adapting pretrained diffusion denoising networks to their input. We examine two adaption strategies: the first uses only the degraded image, while the second, which we advocate, is performed using images that are ``nearest neighbors'' of the degraded image, retrieved from a diverse dataset using an off-the-shelf visual-language model. To evaluate our method, we test it on two state-of-the-art publicly available diffusion models, Stable Diffusion and Guided Diffusion. We show that our proposed `adaptive diffusion for image reconstruction' (ADIR) approach achieves a significant improvement in the super-resolution, deblurring, and text-based editing tasks.
