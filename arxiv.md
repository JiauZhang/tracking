        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have many application areas including image editing, domain translation, missing data imputation, and support for creative work. However, GANs are considered 'black boxes'. Specifically, the end-users have little control over how to improve editing directions through disentanglement. Prior work focused on new GAN architectures to disentangle editing directions. Alternatively, we propose GANravel a user-driven direction disentanglement tool that complements the existing GAN architectures and allows users to improve editing directions iteratively. In two user studies with 16 participants each, GANravel users were able to disentangle directions and outperformed the state-of-the-art direction discovery baselines in disentanglement performance. In the second user study, GANravel was used in a creative task of creating dog memes and was able to create high-quality edited images and GIFs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Adversarial nets have proved to be powerful in various domains including generative modeling (GANs), transfer learning, and fairness. However, successfully training adversarial nets using first-order methods remains a major challenge. Typically, careful choices of the learning rates are needed to maintain the delicate balance between the competing networks. In this paper, we design a novel learning rate scheduler that dynamically adapts the learning rate of the adversary to maintain the right balance. The scheduler is driven by the fact that the loss of an ideal adversarial net is a constant known a priori. The scheduler is thus designed to keep the loss of the optimized adversarial net close to that of an ideal network. We run large-scale experiments to study the effectiveness of the scheduler on two popular applications: GANs for image generation and adversarial nets for domain adaptation. Our experiments indicate that adversarial nets trained with the scheduler are less likely to diverge and require significantly less tuning. For example, on CelebA, a GAN with the scheduler requires only one-tenth of the tuning budget needed without a scheduler. Moreover, the scheduler leads to statistically significant improvements in model quality, reaching up to $27\%$ in Frechet Inception Distance for image generation and $3\%$ in test accuracy for domain adaptation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Forecasting future weather and climate is inherently difficult. Machine learning offers new approaches to increase the accuracy and computational efficiency of forecasts, but current methods are unable to accurately model uncertainty in high-dimensional predictions. Score-based diffusion models offer a new approach to modeling probability distributions over many dependent variables, and in this work, we demonstrate how they provide probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate variables at unprecedented resolution, speed, and accuracy. We apply the technique to day-ahead solar irradiance forecasts by generating many samples from a diffusion model trained to super-resolve coarse-resolution numerical weather predictions to high-resolution weather satellite observations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Few-shot image generation aims to generate data of an unseen category based on only a few samples. Apart from basic content generation, a bunch of downstream applications hopefully benefit from this task, such as low-data detection and few-shot classification. To achieve this goal, the generated images should guarantee category retention for classification beyond the visual quality and diversity. In our preliminary work, we present an ``editing-based'' framework Attribute Group Editing (AGE) for reliable few-shot image generation, which largely improves the generation performance. Nevertheless, AGE's performance on downstream classification is not as satisfactory as expected. This paper investigates the class inconsistency problem and proposes Stable Attribute Group Editing (SAGE) for more stable class-relevant image generation. SAGE takes use of all given few-shot images and estimates a class center embedding based on the category-relevant attribute dictionary. Meanwhile, according to the projection weights on the category-relevant attribute dictionary, we can select category-irrelevant attributes from the similar seen categories. Consequently, SAGE injects the whole distribution of the novel class into StyleGAN's latent space, thus largely remains the category retention and stability of the generated images. Going one step further, we find that class inconsistency is a common problem in GAN-generated images for downstream classification. Even though the generated images look photo-realistic and requires no category-relevant editing, they are usually of limited help for downstream classification. We systematically discuss this issue from both the generative model and classification model perspectives, and propose to boost the downstream classification performance of SAGE by enhancing the pixel and frequency components. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new approach for 3D shape generation, inversion, and manipulation, through a direct generative modeling on a continuous implicit representation in wavelet domain. Specifically, we propose a compact wavelet representation with a pair of coarse and detail coefficient volumes to implicitly represent 3D shapes via truncated signed distance functions and multi-scale biorthogonal wavelets. Then, we design a pair of neural networks: a diffusion-based generator to produce diverse shapes in the form of the coarse coefficient volumes and a detail predictor to produce compatible detail coefficient volumes for introducing fine structures and details. Further, we may jointly train an encoder network to learn a latent space for inverting shapes, allowing us to enable a rich variety of whole-shape and region-aware shape manipulations. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results manifest the compelling shape generation, inversion, and manipulation capabilities of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the rising demand for wireless services and increased awareness of the need for data protection, existing network traffic analysis and management architectures are facing unprecedented challenges in classifying and synthesizing the increasingly diverse services and applications. This paper proposes FS-GAN, a federated self-supervised learning framework to support automatic traffic analysis and synthesis over a large number of heterogeneous datasets. FS-GAN is composed of multiple distributed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a set of generators, each being designed to generate synthesized data samples following the distribution of an individual service traffic, and each discriminator being trained to differentiate the synthesized data samples and the real data samples of a local dataset. A federated learning-based framework is adopted to coordinate local model training processes of different GANs across different datasets. FS-GAN can classify data of unknown types of service and create synthetic samples that capture the traffic distribution of the unknown types. We prove that FS-GAN can minimize the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the distribution of real data across all the datasets and that of the synthesized data samples. FS-GAN also maximizes the JSD among the distributions of data samples created by different generators, resulting in each generator producing synthetic data samples that follow the same distribution as one particular service type. Extensive simulation results show that the classification accuracy of FS-GAN achieves over 20% improvement in average compared to the state-of-the-art clustering-based traffic analysis algorithms. FS-GAN also has the capability to synthesize highly complex mixtures of traffic types without requiring any human-labeled data samples. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image geolocalization is the challenging task of predicting the geographic coordinates of origin for a given photo. It is an unsolved problem relying on the ability to combine visual clues with general knowledge about the world to make accurate predictions across geographies. We present $\href{https://huggingface.co/geolocal/StreetCLIP}{\text{StreetCLIP}}$, a robust, publicly available foundation model not only achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-domain image geolocalization benchmarks but also doing so in a zero-shot setting, outperforming supervised models trained on more than 4 million images. Our method introduces a meta-learning approach for generalized zero-shot learning by pretraining CLIP from synthetic captions, grounding CLIP in a domain of choice. We show that our method effectively transfers CLIP's generalized zero-shot capabilities to the domain of image geolocalization, improving in-domain generalized zero-shot performance without finetuning StreetCLIP on a fixed set of classes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multispectral pedestrian detection is an important task for many around-the-clock applications, since the visible and thermal modalities can provide complementary information especially under low light conditions. To reduce the influence of hand-designed components in available multispectral pedestrian detectors, we propose a MultiSpectral pedestrian DEtection TRansformer (MS-DETR), which extends deformable DETR to multi-modal paradigm. In order to facilitate the multi-modal learning process, a Reference box Constrained Cross-Attention (RCCA) module is firstly introduced to the multi-modal Transformer decoder, which takes fusion branch together with the reference boxes as intermediaries to enable the interaction of visible and thermal modalities. To further balance the contribution of different modalities, we design a modality-balanced optimization strategy, which aligns the slots of decoders by adaptively adjusting the instance-level weight of three branches. Our end-to-end MS-DETR shows superior performance on the challenging KAIST and CVC-14 benchmark datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large transformers are powerful architectures for self-supervised analysis of data of various nature, ranging from protein sequences to text to images. In these models, the data representation in the hidden layers live in the same space, and the semantic structure of the dataset emerges by a sequence of functionally identical transformations between one representation and the next. We here characterize the geometric and statistical properties of these representations, focusing on the evolution of such proprieties across the layers. By analyzing geometric properties such as the intrinsic dimension (ID) and the neighbor composition we find that the representations evolve in a strikingly similar manner in transformers trained on protein language tasks and image reconstruction tasks. In the first layers, the data manifold expands, becoming high-dimensional, and then it contracts significantly in the intermediate layers. In the last part of the model, the ID remains approximately constant or forms a second shallow peak. We show that the semantic complexity of the dataset emerges at the end of the first peak. This phenomenon can be observed across many models trained on diverse datasets. Based on these observations, we suggest using the ID profile as an unsupervised proxy to identify the layers which are more suitable for downstream learning tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Nowadays, many researchers are focusing their attention on the subject of machine translation (MT). However, Persian machine translation has remained unexplored despite a vast amount of research being conducted in languages with high resources, such as English. Moreover, while a substantial amount of research has been undertaken in statistical machine translation for some datasets in Persian, there is currently no standard baseline for transformer-based text2text models on each corpus. This study collected and analysed the most popular and valuable parallel corpora, which were used for Persian-English translation. Furthermore, we fine-tuned and evaluated two state-of-the-art attention-based seq2seq models on each dataset separately (48 results). We hope this paper will assist researchers in comparing their Persian to English and vice versa machine translation results to a standard baseline. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers have achieved great success in machine translation, but transformer-based NMT models often require millions of bilingual parallel corpus for training. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named as attention link (AL) to help improve transformer models' performance, especially in low training resources. We theoretically demonstrate the superiority of our attention link architecture in low training resources. Besides, we have done a large number of experiments, including en-de, de-en, en-fr, en-it, it-en, en-ro translation tasks on the IWSLT14 dataset as well as real low resources scene on bn-gu and gu-ta translation tasks on the CVIT PIB dataset.

In addition, we achieve a 37.9 BLEU score, a new sota, on the IWSLT14 de-en task by combining our attention link and other advanced methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches have recently garnered a lot of attention. Having considerably lower number of trainable weights, these methods can bring about scalability and computational effectiveness. In this paper, we look for optimal sub-networks and investigate the capability of different transformer modules in transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a downstream task. Our empirical results suggest that every transformer module in BERT can act as a winning ticket: fine-tuning each specific module while keeping the rest of the network frozen can lead to comparable performance to the full fine-tuning. Among different modules, LayerNorms exhibit the best capacity for knowledge transfer with limited trainable weights, to the extent that, with only 0.003% of all parameters in the layer-wise analysis, they show acceptable performance on various target tasks. On the reasons behind their effectiveness, we argue that their notable performance could be attributed to their high-magnitude weights compared to that of the other modules in the pre-trained BERT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Among these applications, cross-modal interaction and complementary information from different modalities are crucial for advanced models to perform any multimodal task, e.g., understand, recognize, retrieve, or generate optimally. Researchers have proposed diverse methods to address these tasks. The different variants of transformer-based architectures performed extraordinarily on multiple modalities. This survey presents the comprehensive literature on the evolution and enhancement of deep learning multimodal architectures to deal with textual, visual and audio features for diverse cross-modal and modern multimodal tasks. This study summarizes the (i) recent task-specific deep learning methodologies, (ii) the pretraining types and multimodal pretraining objectives, (iii) from state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal approaches to unifying architectures, and (iv) multimodal task categories and possible future improvements that can be devised for better multimodal learning. Moreover, we prepare a dataset section for new researchers that covers most of the benchmarks for pretraining and finetuning. Finally, major challenges, gaps, and potential research topics are explored.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Understanding the inner workings of neural network models is a crucial step for rationalizing their output and refining their architecture. Transformer-based models are the core of recent natural language processing and have been analyzed typically with attention patterns as their epoch-making feature is contextualizing surrounding input words via attention mechanisms. In this study, we analyze their inner contextualization by considering all the components, including the feed-forward block (i.e., a feed-forward layer and its surrounding residual and normalization layers) as well as the attention. Our experiments with masked language models show that each of the previously overlooked components did modify the degree of the contextualization in case of processing special word-word pairs (e.g., consisting of named entities). Furthermore, we find that some components cancel each other's effects. Our results could update the typical view about each component's roles (e.g., attention performs contextualization, and the other components serve different roles) in the Transformer layer. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are an attractive generative modeling technique, but they have thus far been held back by limitations in their simulation-based maximum likelihood training. In this paper, we introduce a new technique called conditional flow matching (CFM), a simulation-free training objective for CNFs. CFM features a stable regression objective like that used to train the stochastic flow in diffusion models but enjoys the efficient inference of deterministic flow models. In contrast to both diffusion models and prior CNF training algorithms, our CFM objective does not require the source distribution to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. Based on this new objective, we also introduce optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler flows that are more stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our experiments. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety of conditional and unconditional generation tasks such as inferring single cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr\"odinger bridge inference.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We develop a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)-FEM algorithm for linear, elliptic diffusion problems in polytopal domain $\mathcal D\subset \mathbb R^d$, with Besov-tree random coefficients. This is to say that the logarithms of the diffusion coefficients are sampled from so-called Besov-tree priors, which have recently been proposed to model data for fractal phenomena in science and engineering. Numerical analysis of the fully discrete FEM for the elliptic PDE includes quadrature approximation and must account for a) nonuniform pathwise upper and lower coefficient bounds, and for b) low path-regularity of the Besov-tree coefficients. Admissible non-parametric random coefficients correspond to random functions exhibiting singularities on random fractals with tunable fractal dimension, but involve no a-priori specification of the fractal geometry of singular supports of sample paths. Optimal complexity and convergence rate estimates for quantities of interest and for their second moments are proved. A convergence analysis for MLMC-FEM is performed which yields choices of the algorithmic steering parameters for efficient implementation. A complexity (``error vs work'') analysis of the MLMC-FEM approximations is provided. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Language Models (LMs) have been shown to leak information about training data through sentence-level membership inference and reconstruction attacks. Understanding the risk of LMs leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has received less attention, which can be attributed to the false assumption that dataset curation techniques such as scrubbing are sufficient to prevent PII leakage. Scrubbing techniques reduce but do not prevent the risk of PII leakage: in practice scrubbing is imperfect and must balance the trade-off between minimizing disclosure and preserving the utility of the dataset. On the other hand, it is unclear to which extent algorithmic defenses such as differential privacy, designed to guarantee sentence- or user-level privacy, prevent PII disclosure. In this work, we propose (i) a taxonomy of PII leakage in LMs, (ii) metrics to quantify PII leakage, and (iii) attacks showing that PII leakage is a threat in practice. Our taxonomy provides rigorous game-based definitions for PII leakage via black-box extraction, inference, and reconstruction attacks with only API access to an LM. We empirically evaluate attacks against GPT-2 models fine-tuned on three domains: case law, health care, and e-mails. Our main contributions are (i) novel attacks that can extract up to 10 times more PII sequences as existing attacks, (ii) showing that sentence-level differential privacy reduces the risk of PII disclosure but still leaks about 3% of PII sequences, and (iii) a subtle connection between record-level membership inference and PII reconstruction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: If large language models like GPT-3 preferably produce a particular point of view, they may influence people's opinions on an unknown scale. This study investigates whether a language-model-powered writing assistant that generates some opinions more often than others impacts what users write - and what they think. In an online experiment, we asked participants (N=1,506) to write a post discussing whether social media is good for society. Treatment group participants used a language-model-powered writing assistant configured to argue that social media is good or bad for society. Participants then completed a social media attitude survey, and independent judges (N=500) evaluated the opinions expressed in their writing. Using the opinionated language model affected the opinions expressed in participants' writing and shifted their opinions in the subsequent attitude survey. We discuss the wider implications of our results and argue that the opinions built into AI language technologies need to be monitored and engineered more carefully. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-to-image generative models have recently exploded in popularity and accessibility. Yet so far, use of these models in creative tasks that bridge the 2D digital world and the creation of physical artefacts has been understudied. We conduct a pilot study to investigate if and how text-to-image models can be used to assist in upstream tasks within the creative process, such as ideation and visualization, prior to a sculpture-making activity. Thirty participants selected sculpture-making materials and generated three images using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator, each with text prompts of their choice, with the aim of informing and then creating a physical sculpture. The majority of participants (23/30) reported that the generated images informed their sculptures, and 28/30 reported interest in using text-to-image models to help them in a creative task in the future. We identify several prompt engineering strategies and find that a participant's prompting strategy relates to their stage in the creative process. We discuss how our findings can inform support for users at different stages of the design process and for using text-to-image models for physical artefact design. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics enables the study of biological processes at temporal and spatial scales that would be intractable at an atomistic resolution. However, accurately learning a CG force field remains a challenge. In this work, we leverage connections between score-based generative models, force fields and molecular dynamics to learn a CG force field without requiring any force inputs during training. Specifically, we train a diffusion generative model on protein structures from molecular dynamics simulations, and we show that its score function approximates a force field that can directly be used to simulate CG molecular dynamics. While having a vastly simplified training setup compared to previous work, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved performance across several small- to medium-sized protein simulations, reproducing the CG equilibrium distribution, and preserving dynamics of all-atom simulations such as protein folding events. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With recent achievements in tasks requiring context awareness, foundation models have been adopted to treat large-scale data from electronic health record (EHR) systems. However, previous clinical recommender systems based on foundation models have a limited purpose of imitating clinicians' behavior and do not directly consider a problem of missing values. In this paper, we propose Clinical Decision Transformer (CDT), a recommender system that generates a sequence of medications to reach a desired range of clinical states given as goal prompts. For this, we conducted goal-conditioned sequencing, which generated a subsequence of treatment history with prepended future goal state, and trained the CDT to model sequential medications required to reach that goal state. For contextual embedding over intra-admission and inter-admissions, we adopted a GPT-based architecture with an admission-wise attention mask and column embedding. In an experiment, we extracted a diabetes dataset from an EHR system, which contained treatment histories of 4788 patients. We observed that the CDT achieved the intended treatment effect according to goal prompt ranges (e.g., NormalA1c, LowerA1c, and HigherA1c), contrary to the case with behavior cloning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore clinical recommendations from the perspective of goal prompting.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot learning abilities for image understanding, yet limited effort has been made to investigate CLIP for zero-shot video recognition. We introduce Open-VCLIP, a simple yet effective approach that transforms CLIP into strong zero-shot video classifiers that can recognize unseen actions and events at test time. Our framework extends CLIP with minimal modifications to model spatial-temporal relationships in videos, making it a specialized video classifier, while striving for generalization. We formally show that training an Open-VCLIP is equivalent to continual learning with zero historical data. To address this problem, we propose Interpolated Weight Optimization, which utilizes the benefit of weight interpolation in both training and test time. We evaluate our method on three popular and challenging action recognition datasets following various zero-shot evaluation protocols and we demonstrate our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by clear margins. In particular, we achieve 87.9%, 58.3%, 81.1% zero-shot accuracy on UCF, HMDB and Kinetics-600 respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.3%, 7.8% and 12.2%. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models generate samples by reversing a fixed forward diffusion process. Despite already providing impressive empirical results, these diffusion models algorithms can be further improved by reducing the variance of the training targets in their denoising score-matching objective. We argue that the source of such variance lies in the handling of intermediate noise-variance scales, where multiple modes in the data affect the direction of reverse paths. We propose to remedy the problem by incorporating a reference batch which we use to calculate weighted conditional scores as more stable training targets. We show that the procedure indeed helps in the challenging intermediate regime by reducing (the trace of) the covariance of training targets. The new stable targets can be seen as trading bias for reduced variance, where the bias vanishes with increasing reference batch size. Empirically, we show that the new objective improves the image quality, stability, and training speed of various popular diffusion models across datasets with both general ODE and SDE solvers. When used in combination with EDM, our method yields a current SOTA FID of 1.90 with 35 network evaluations on the unconditional CIFAR-10 generation task.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: End-to-end autonomous driving has great potential in the transportation industry. However, the lack of transparency and interpretability of the automatic decision-making process hinders its industrial adoption in practice. There have been some early attempts to use attention maps or cost volume for better model explainability which is difficult for ordinary passengers to understand. To bridge the gap, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based architecture, ADAPT (Action-aware Driving cAPtion Transformer), which provides user-friendly natural language narrations and reasoning for each decision making step of autonomous vehicular control and action. ADAPT jointly trains both the driving caption task and the vehicular control prediction task, through a shared video representation. Experiments on BDD-X (Berkeley DeepDrive eXplanation) dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the ADAPT framework on both automatic metrics and human evaluation. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework in real-world applications, we build a novel deployable system that takes raw car videos as input and outputs the action narrations and reasoning in real time.

In existing works, autoregressive (AR) models are either replaced or combined with feed-forward neural networks(NNs) or, alternatively, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This paper explores the possibility of using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) and transformer neural network (TNN) models for channel state information (CSI) prediction. Simulation results show that both, Seq2Seq and TNNs, represent an appealing alternative to RNNs and feed-forward NNs in the context of CSI prediction. Additionally, the TNN with a few adaptations can extrapolate better than other models to CSI sequences that are either shorter or longer than the ones the model saw during training. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
