        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications have sparked extraordinary interest in recent years. This achievement can be ascribed in part to advances in AI subfields including Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Deep learning, a sub-field of machine learning that employs artificial neural network concepts, has enabled the most rapid growth in these domains. The integration of vision and language has sparked a lot of attention as a result of this. The tasks have been created in such a way that they properly exemplify the concepts of deep learning. In this review paper, we provide a thorough and an extensive review of the state of the arts approaches, key models design principles and discuss existing datasets, methods, their problem formulation and evaluation measures for VQA and Visual reasoning tasks to understand vision and language representation learning. We also present some potential future paths in this field of research, with the hope that our study may generate new ideas and novel approaches to handle existing difficulties and develop new applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based face swapping framework for the first time, called DiffFace, composed of training ID conditional DDPM, sampling with facial guidance, and a target-preserving blending. In specific, in the training process, the ID conditional DDPM is trained to generate face images with the desired identity. In the sampling process, we use the off-the-shelf facial expert models to make the model transfer source identity while preserving target attributes faithfully. During this process, to preserve the background of the target image and obtain the desired face swapping result, we additionally propose a target-preserving blending strategy. It helps our model to keep the attributes of the target face from noise while transferring the source facial identity. In addition, without any re-training, our model can flexibly apply additional facial guidance and adaptively control the ID-attributes trade-off to achieve the desired results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that applies the diffusion model in face swapping task. Compared with previous GAN-based approaches, by taking advantage of the diffusion model for the face swapping task, DiffFace achieves better benefits such as training stability, high fidelity, diversity of the samples, and controllability. Extensive experiments show that our DiffFace is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art methods on several standard face swapping benchmarks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph representation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple layers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and poor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but significantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural limitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph MLP-Mixer, that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on the Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) and the TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges, surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on all of them. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As language models have grown in parameters and layers, it has become much harder to train and infer with them on single GPUs. This is severely restricting the availability of large language models such as GPT-3, BERT-Large, and many others. A common technique to solve this problem is pruning the network architecture by removing transformer heads, fully-connected weights, and other modules. The main challenge is to discern the important parameters from the less important ones. Our goal is to find strong metrics for identifying such parameters. We thus propose two strategies: Cam-Cut based on the GradCAM interpretations, and Smooth-Cut based on the SmoothGrad, for calculating the importance scores. Through this work, we show that our scoring functions are able to assign more relevant task-based scores to the network parameters, and thus both our pruning approaches significantly outperform the standard weight and gradient-based strategies, especially at higher compression ratios in BERT-based models. We also analyze our pruning masks and find them to be significantly different from the ones obtained using standard metrics. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Mitosis nuclei count is one of the important indicators for the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer. The manual annotation needs experienced pathologists, which is very time-consuming and inefficient. With the development of deep learning methods, some models with good performance have emerged, but the generalization ability should be further strengthened. In this paper, we propose a two-stage mitosis segmentation and classification method, named SCMitosis. Firstly, the segmentation performance with a high recall rate is achieved by the proposed depthwise separable convolution residual block and channel-spatial attention gate. Then, a classification network is cascaded to further improve the detection performance of mitosis nuclei. The proposed model is verified on the ICPR 2012 dataset, and the highest F-score value of 0.8687 is obtained compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, the model also achieves good performance on GZMH dataset, which is prepared by our group and will be firstly released with the publication of this paper.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the development of natural language processing techniques(NLP), automatic diagnosis of eye diseases using ophthalmology electronic medical records (OEMR) has become possible. It aims to evaluate the condition of both eyes of a patient respectively, and we formulate it as a particular multi-label classification task in this paper. Although there are a few related studies in other diseases, automatic diagnosis of eye diseases exhibits unique characteristics. First, descriptions of both eyes are mixed up in OEMR documents, with both free text and templated asymptomatic descriptions, resulting in sparsity and clutter of information. Second, OEMR documents contain multiple parts of descriptions and have long document lengths. Third, it is critical to provide explainability to the disease diagnosis model. To overcome those challenges, we present an effective automatic eye disease diagnosis framework, NEEDED. In this framework, a preprocessing module is integrated to improve the density and quality of information. Then, we design a hierarchical transformer structure for learning the contextualized representations of each sentence in the OEMR document. For the diagnosis part, we propose an attention-based predictor that enables traceable diagnosis by obtaining disease-specific information. Experiments on the real dataset and comparison with several baseline models show the advantage and explainability of our framework. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Creating an essay based on a few given topics is a challenging NLP task. Although several effective methods for this problem, topic-to-essay generation, have appeared recently, there is still much room for improvement, especially in terms of the coverage of the given topics and the coherence of the generated text. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called TegFormer which utilizes the Transformer architecture where the encoder is enriched with domain-specific contexts while the decoder is enhanced by a large-scale pre-trained language model. Specifically, a \emph{Topic-Extension} layer capturing the interaction between the given topics and their domain-specific contexts is plugged into the encoder. Since the given topics are usually concise and sparse, such an additional layer can bring more topic-related semantics in to facilitate the subsequent natural language generation. Moreover, an \emph{Embedding-Fusion} module that combines the domain-specific word embeddings learnt from the given corpus and the general-purpose word embeddings provided by a GPT-2 model pre-trained on massive text data is integrated into the decoder. Since GPT-2 is at a much larger scale, it contains a lot more implicit linguistic knowledge which would help the decoder to produce more grammatical and readable text. Extensive experiments have shown that the pieces of text generated by TegFormer have better topic coverage and higher text coherence than those from SOTA topic-to-essay techniques, according to automatic and human evaluations. As revealed by ablation studies, both the Topic-Extension layer and the Embedding-Fusion module contribute substantially to TegFormer's performance advantage. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we investigate improving the generalizability of GAN-generated image detectors by performing data augmentation in the fingerprint domain. Specifically, we first separate the fingerprints and contents of the GAN-generated images using an autoencoder based GAN fingerprint extractor, followed by random perturbations of the fingerprints. Then the original fingerprints are substituted with the perturbed fingerprints and added to the original contents, to produce images that are visually invariant but with distinct fingerprints. The perturbed images can successfully imitate images generated by different GANs to improve the generalization of the detectors, which is demonstrated by the spectra visualization. To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct data augmentation in the fingerprint domain. Our work explores a novel prospect that is distinct from previous works on spatial and frequency domain augmentation. Extensive cross-GAN experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods in detecting fake images generated by unknown GANs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: People with diabetes are more likely to develop diabetic retinopathy (DR) than healthy people. However, DR is the leading cause of blindness. At present, the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy mainly relies on the experienced clinician to recognize the fine features in color fundus images. This is a time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, to promote the development of UW-OCTA DR automatic detection, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation method for UW-OCTA DR image grade assessment. This method, first, uses the MAE algorithm to perform semi-supervised pre-training on the UW-OCTA DR grade assessment dataset to mine the supervised information in the UW-OCTA images, thereby alleviating the need for labeled data. Secondly, to more fully mine the lesion features of each region in the UW-OCTA image, this paper constructs a cross-algorithm ensemble DR tissue segmentation algorithm by deploying three algorithms with different visual feature processing strategies. The algorithm contains three sub-algorithms, namely pre-trained MAE, ConvNeXt, and SegFormer. Based on the initials of these three sub-algorithms, the algorithm can be named MCS-DRNet. Finally, we use the MCS-DRNet algorithm as an inspector to check and revise the results of the preliminary evaluation of the DR grade evaluation algorithm. The experimental results show that the mean dice similarity coefficient of MCS-DRNet v1 and v2 are 0.5161 and 0.5544, respectively. The quadratic weighted kappa of the DR grading evaluation is 0.7559. Our code will be released soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers have recently gained attention in the computer vision domain due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention mechanism, which is the core part of the Transformer model, usually suffers from quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of tokens. Many architectures attempt to reduce model complexity by limiting the self-attention mechanism to local regions or by redesigning the tokenization process. In this paper, we propose DAE-Former, a novel method that seeks to provide an alternative perspective by efficiently designing the self-attention mechanism. More specifically, we reformulate the self-attention mechanism to capture both spatial and channel relations across the whole feature dimension while staying computationally efficient. Furthermore, we redesign the skip connection path by including the cross-attention module to ensure the feature reusability and enhance the localization power. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multi-organ cardiac and skin lesion segmentation datasets without requiring pre-training weights. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mindflow-institue/DAEFormer. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Classification using supervised learning requires annotating a large amount of classes-balanced data for model training and testing. This has practically limited the scope of applications with supervised learning, in particular deep learning. To address the issues associated with limited and imbalanced data, this paper introduces a sample-efficient co-supervised learning paradigm (SEC-CGAN), in which a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is trained alongside the classifier and supplements semantics-conditioned, confidence-aware synthesized examples to the annotated data during the training process. In this setting, the CGAN not only serves as a co-supervisor but also provides complementary quality examples to aid the classifier training in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SEC-CGAN outperforms the external classifier GAN (EC-GAN) and a baseline ResNet-18 classifier. For the comparison, all classifiers in above methods adopt the ResNet-18 architecture as the backbone. Particularly, for the Street View House Numbers dataset, using the 5% of training data, a test accuracy of 90.26% is achieved by SEC-CGAN as opposed to 88.59% by EC-GAN and 87.17% by the baseline classifier; for the highway image dataset, using the 10% of training data, a test accuracy of 98.27% is achieved by SEC-CGAN, compared to 97.84% by EC-GAN and 95.52% by the baseline classifier. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in multiscale information encoding, we introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) based semi-supervised method for detection of faulty traffic data, which is cast as a classification problem. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to the time series of traffic volume data to obtain rich features embodied in time-frequency representation, followed by a twin of VAE models to separately encode normal data and faulty data. The resulting multiscale dual encodings are concatenated and fed to an attention-based classifier, consisting of a self-attention module and a multilayer perceptron. For comparison, the proposed architecture is evaluated against five different encoding schemes, including (1) VAE with only normal data encoding, (2) VAE with only faulty data encoding, (3) VAE with both normal and faulty data encodings, but without attention module in the classifier, (4) siamese encoding, and (5) cross-vision transformer (CViT) encoding. The first four encoding schemes adopted the same convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture while the fifth encoding scheme follows the transformer architecture of CViT. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture with the dual encoding scheme, coupled with attention module, outperforms other encoding schemes and results in classification accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 95.5%, and recall of 97.7%. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fine-grained visual recognition is to classify objects with visually similar appearances into subcategories, which has made great progress with the development of deep CNNs. However, handling subtle differences between different subcategories still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose to solve this issue in one unified framework from two aspects, i.e., constructing feature-level interrelationships, and capturing part-level discriminative features. This framework, namely PArt-guided Relational Transformers (PART), is proposed to learn the discriminative part features with an automatic part discovery module, and to explore the intrinsic correlations with a feature transformation module by adapting the Transformer models from the field of natural language processing. The part discovery module efficiently discovers the discriminative regions which are highly-corresponded to the gradient descent procedure. Then the second feature transformation module builds correlations within the global embedding and multiple part embedding, enhancing spatial interactions among semantic pixels. Moreover, our proposed approach does not rely on additional part branches in the inference time and reaches state-of-the-art performance on 3 widely-used fine-grained object recognition benchmarks. Experimental results and explainable visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fine-grained visual parsing, including fine-grained part segmentation and fine-grained object recognition, has attracted considerable critical attention due to its importance in many real-world applications, e.g., agriculture, remote sensing, and space technologies. Predominant research efforts tackle these fine-grained sub-tasks following different paradigms, while the inherent relations between these tasks are neglected. Moreover, given most of the research remains fragmented, we conduct an in-depth study of the advanced work from a new perspective of learning the part relationship. In this perspective, we first consolidate recent research and benchmark syntheses with new taxonomies. Based on this consolidation, we revisit the universal challenges in fine-grained part segmentation and recognition tasks and propose new solutions by part relationship learning for these important challenges. Furthermore, we conclude several promising lines of research in fine-grained visual parsing for future research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fine-grained classification and counting of bone marrow erythroid cells are vital for evaluating the health status and formulating therapeutic schedules for leukemia or hematopathy. Due to the subtle visual differences between different types of erythroid cells, it is challenging to apply existing image-based deep learning models for fine-grained erythroid cell classification. Moreover, there is no large open-source datasets on erythroid cells to support the model training. In this paper, we introduce BMEC (Bone Morrow Erythroid Cells), the first large fine-grained image dataset of erythroid cells, to facilitate more deep learning research on erythroid cells. BMEC contains 5,666 images of individual erythroid cells, each of which is extracted from the bone marrow erythroid cell smears and professionally annotated to one of the four types of erythroid cells. To distinguish the erythroid cells, one key indicator is the cell shape which is closely related to the cell growth and maturation. Therefore, we design a novel shape-aware image classification network for fine-grained erythroid cell classification. The shape feature is extracted from the shape mask image and aggregated to the raw image feature with a shape attention module. With the shape-attended image feature, our network achieved superior classification performance (81.12\% top-1 accuracy) on the BMEC dataset comparing to the baseline methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the shape information for the fine-grained cell classification. To further verify the generalizability of our method, we tested our network on two additional public white blood cells (WBC) datasets and the results show our shape-aware method can generally outperform recent state-of-the-art works on classifying the WBC. The code and BMEC dataset can be found on https://github.com/wangye8899/BMEC. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical structure is pervasive in real-world applications, demanding not only predicting each level of the hierarchy, but also reconciling all forecasts to ensure coherency, i.e., the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Currently, the development of IoT firmware heavily depends on third-party components (TPCs) to improve development efficiency. Nevertheless, TPCs are not secure, and the vulnerabilities in TPCs will influence the security of IoT firmware. Existing works pay less attention to the vulnerabilities caused by TPCs, and we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the security impact of TPC vulnerability against firmware. To fill in the knowledge gap, we design and implement FirmSec, which leverages syntactical features and control-flow graph features to detect the TPCs in firmware, and then recognizes the corresponding vulnerabilities. Based on FirmSec, we present the first large-scale analysis of the security risks raised by TPCs on $34,136$ firmware images. We successfully detect 584 TPCs and identify 128,757 vulnerabilities caused by 429 CVEs. Our in-depth analysis reveals the diversity of security risks in firmware and discovers some well-known vulnerabilities are still rooted in firmware. Besides, we explore the geographical distribution of vulnerable devices and confirm that the security situation of devices in different regions varies. Our analysis also indicates that vulnerabilities caused by TPCs in firmware keep growing with the boom of the IoT ecosystem. Further analysis shows 2,478 commercial firmware images have potentially violated GPL/AGPL licensing terms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pure transformers have shown great potential for vision tasks recently. However, their accuracy in small or medium datasets is not satisfactory. Although some existing methods introduce a CNN as a teacher to guide the training process by distillation, the gap between teacher and student networks would lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a new One-shot Vision transformer search framework with Online distillation, namely OVO. OVO samples sub-nets for both teacher and student networks for better distillation results. Benefiting from the online distillation, thousands of subnets in the supernet are well-trained without extra finetuning or retraining. In experiments, OVO-Ti achieves 73.32% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 75.2% on CIFAR-100, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Score-based diffusion models have captured widespread attention and funded fast progress of recent vision generative tasks. In this paper, we focus on diffusion model backbone which has been much neglected before. We systematically explore vision Transformers as diffusion learners for various generative tasks. With our improvements the performance of vanilla ViT-based backbone (IU-ViT) is boosted to be on par with traditional U-Net-based methods. We further provide a hypothesis on the implication of disentangling the generative backbone as an encoder-decoder structure and show proof-of-concept experiments verifying the effectiveness of a stronger encoder for generative tasks with ASymmetriC ENcoder Decoder (ASCEND). Our improvements achieve competitive results on CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN, CUB Bird and large-resolution text-to-image tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully train a single diffusion model on text-to-image task beyond 64x64 resolution. We hope this will motivate people to rethink the modeling choices and the training pipelines for diffusion-based generative models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Debugging takes up a significant portion of developer time. As a result, automated debugging techniques including Fault Localization (FL) and Automated Program Repair (APR) have garnered significant attention due to their potential to aid developers in debugging tasks. Despite intensive research on these subjects, we are unaware of a theoretic framework that highlights the principles behind automated debugging and allows abstract analysis of techniques. Such a framework would heighten our understanding of the endeavor and provide a way to formally analyze techniques and approaches. To this end, we first propose a Bayesian framework of understanding automated repair and find that in conjunction with a concrete statement of the objective of automated debugging, we can recover maximal fault localization formulae from prior work, as well as analyze existing APR techniques and their underlying assumptions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Periocular refers to the region of the face that surrounds the eye socket. This is a feature-rich area that can be used by itself to determine the identity of an individual. It is especially useful when the iris or the face cannot be reliably acquired. This can be the case of unconstrained or uncooperative scenarios, where the face may appear partially occluded, or the subject-to-camera distance may be high. However, it has received revived attention during the pandemic due to masked faces, leaving the ocular region as the only visible facial area, even in controlled scenarios. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art of periocular biometrics, giving an overall framework of its most significant research aspects. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The development of deep learning models in medical image analysis is majorly limited by the lack of large-sized and well-annotated datasets. Unsupervised learning does not require labels and is more suitable for solving medical image analysis problems. However, most of the current unsupervised learning methods need to be applied to large datasets. To make unsupervised learning applicable to small datasets, we proposed Swin MAE, which is a masked autoencoder with Swin Transformer as its backbone. Even on a dataset of only a few thousand medical images and without using any pre-trained models, Swin MAE is still able to learn useful semantic features purely from images. It can equal or even slightly outperform the supervised model obtained by Swin Transformer trained on ImageNet in terms of the transfer learning results of downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Heterogeneous graph contrastive learning has received wide attention recently. Some existing methods use meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects, to construct contrastive views. However, most of them ignore the rich meta-path context information that describes how two objects are connected by meta-paths. On the other hand, they fail to distinguish hard negatives from false negatives, which could adversely affect the model performance. To address the problems, we propose MEOW, a heterogeneous graph contrastive learning model that considers both meta-path contexts and weighted negative samples. Specifically, MEOW constructs a coarse view and a fine-grained view for contrast. The former reflects which objects are connected by meta-paths, while the latter uses meta-path contexts and characterizes the details on how the objects are connected. We take node embeddings in the coarse view as anchors, and construct positive and negative samples from the fine-grained view. Further, to distinguish hard negatives from false negatives, we learn weights of negative samples based on node clustering. We also use prototypical contrastive learning to pull close embeddings of nodes in the same cluster. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of MEOW against other state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With over 500 million tweets posted per day, in Twitter, it is difficult for Twitter users to discover interesting content from the deluge of uninteresting posts. In this work, we present a novel, explainable, topical recommendation system, that utilizes social annotations, to help Twitter users discover tweets, on topics of their interest. A major challenge in using traditional rating dependent recommendation systems, like collaborative filtering and content based systems, in high volume social networks is that, due to attention scarcity most items do not get any ratings. Additionally, the fact that most Twitter users are passive consumers, with 44% users never tweeting, makes it very difficult to use user ratings for generating recommendations. Further, a key challenge in developing recommendation systems is that in many cases users reject relevant recommendations if they are totally unfamiliar with the recommended item. Providing a suitable explanation, for why the item is recommended, significantly improves the acceptability of recommendation. By virtue of being a topical recommendation system our method is able to present simple topical explanations for the generated recommendations. Comparisons with state-of-the-art matrix factorization based collaborative filtering, content based and social recommendations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Legal text retrieval serves as a key component in a wide range of legal text processing tasks such as legal question answering, legal case entailment, and statute law retrieval. The performance of legal text retrieval depends, to a large extent, on the representation of text, both query and legal documents. Based on good representations, a legal text retrieval model can effectively match the query to its relevant documents. Because legal documents often contain long articles and only some parts are relevant to queries, it is quite a challenge for existing models to represent such documents. In this paper, we study the use of attentive neural network-based text representation for statute law document retrieval. We propose a general approach using deep neural networks with attention mechanisms. Based on it, we develop two hierarchical architectures with sparse attention to represent long sentences and articles, and we name them Attentive CNN and Paraformer. The methods are evaluated on datasets of different sizes and characteristics in English, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Experimental results show that: i) Attentive neural methods substantially outperform non-neural methods in terms of retrieval performance across datasets and languages; ii) Pretrained transformer-based models achieve better accuracy on small datasets at the cost of high computational complexity while lighter weight Attentive CNN achieves better accuracy on large datasets; and iii) Our proposed Paraformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COLIEE dataset, achieving the highest recall and F2 scores in the top-N retrieval task. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Tour itinerary planning and recommendation are challenging problems for tourists visiting unfamiliar cities. Many tour recommendation algorithms only consider factors such as the location and popularity of Points of Interest (POIs) but their solutions may not align well with the user's own preferences and other location constraints. Additionally, these solutions do not take into consideration of the users' preference based on their past POIs selection. In this paper, we propose POIBERT, an algorithm for recommending personalized itineraries using the BERT language model on POIs. POIBERT builds upon the highly successful BERT language model with the novel adaptation of a language model to our itinerary recommendation task, alongside an iterative approach to generate consecutive POIs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The C and C++ programming languages are widely used for the implementation of software in critical systems. They are complex languages with subtle features and peculiarities that might baffle even the more expert programmers. Hence, the general prescription of language subsetting, which occurs in most functional safety standards and amounts to only using a "safer" subset of the language, is particularly applicable to them. Coding guidelines are the preferred way of expressing language subsets. Some guidelines are formulated in terms of the programming language and its implementation only: in this case they are amenable to automatic checking. However, due to fundamental limitations of computing, some guidelines are undecidable, that is, they are based on program properties that no current and future algorithm can capture in all cases. The most mature and widespread coding standards, the MISRA ones, explicitly tag guidelines with undecidable or decidable. It turns out that this information is not of secondary nature and must be taken into account for a full understanding of what the guideline is asking for. As a matter of fact, undecidability is a common source of confusion affecting many users of coding standards and of the associated checking tools. In this paper, we recall the notions of decidability and undecidability in terms that are understandable to any C/C++ programmer. The paper includes a systematic study of all the undecidable MISRA C:2012 guidelines, discussing the reasons for the undecidability and its consequences. We pay particular attention to undecidable guidelines that have decidable approximations whose enforcement would not overly constrain the source code. We also discuss some coding guidelines for which compliance is hard, if not impossible, to prove, even beyond the issue of decidability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) studies the problem of mitigating various biases from implicit user feedback data such as clicks, and has been receiving considerable attention recently. A popular ULTR approach for real-world applications uses a two-tower architecture, where click modeling is factorized into a relevance tower with regular input features, and a bias tower with bias-relevant inputs such as the position of a document. A successful factorization will allow the relevance tower to be exempt from biases. In this work, we identify a critical issue that existing ULTR methods ignored - the bias tower can be confounded with the relevance tower via the underlying true relevance. In particular, the positions were determined by the logging policy, i.e., the previous production model, which would possess relevance information. We give both theoretical analysis and empirical results to show the negative effects on relevance tower due to such a correlation. We then propose three methods to mitigate the negative confounding effects by better disentangling relevance and bias. Empirical results on both controlled public datasets and a large-scale industry dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning models are highly dependent on data to work effectively, and they give a better performance upon training on big datasets. Massive research exists in the literature to address the dataset adequacy issue. One promising approach for solving dataset adequacy issues is the data augmentation (DA) approach. In DA, the amount of training data instances is increased by making different transformations on the available data instances to generate new correct and representative data instances. DA increases the dataset size and its variability, which enhances the model performance and its prediction accuracy. DA also solves the class imbalance problem in the classification learning techniques. Few studies have recently considered DA in the Arabic language. These studies rely on traditional augmentation approaches, such as paraphrasing by using rules or noising-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a new Arabic DA method that employs the recent powerful modeling technique, namely the AraGPT-2, for the augmentation process. The generated sentences are evaluated in terms of context, semantics, diversity, and novelty using the Euclidean, cosine, Jaccard, and BLEU distances. Finally, the AraBERT transformer is used on sentiment classification tasks to evaluate the classification performance of the augmented Arabic dataset. The experiments were conducted on four sentiment Arabic datasets, namely AraSarcasm, ASTD, ATT, and MOVIE. The selected datasets vary in size, label number, and unbalanced classes. The results show that the proposed methodology enhanced the Arabic sentiment text classification on all datasets with an increase in F1 score by 4% in AraSarcasm, 6% in ASTD, 9% in ATT, and 13% in MOVIE. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we aim at constructing numerical schemes, that are as efficient as possible in terms of cost and conservation of invariants, for the Vlasov--Fokker--Planck system coupled with Poisson or Amp\`ere equation. Splitting methods are used where the linear terms in space are treated by spectral or semi-Lagrangian methods and the nonlinear diffusion in velocity in the collision operator is treated using a stabilized Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev (RKC) integrator, a powerful alternative of implicit schemes. The new schemes are shown to exactly preserve mass and momentum. The conservation of total energy is obtained using a suitable approximation of the electric field. An H-theorem is proved in the semi-discrete case, while the entropy decay is illustrated numerically for the fully discretized problem. Numerical experiments that include investigation of Landau damping phenomenon and bump-on-tail instability are performed to illustrate the efficiency of the new schemes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Covid-19 pandemic induced a vast increase in adolescents diagnosed with eating disorders and hospitalized due to eating disorders. This immense growth stemmed partially from the stress of the pandemic but also from increased exposure to content that promotes eating disorders via social media, which, within the last decade, has become plagued by pro-eating disorder content. This study aimed to create a deep learning model capable of determining whether a given social media post promotes eating disorders based solely on image data. Tweets from hashtags that have been documented to promote eating disorders along with tweets from unrelated hashtags were collected. After prepossessing, these images were labeled as either pro-eating disorder or not based on which Twitter hashtag they were scraped from. Several deep-learning models were trained on the scraped dataset and were evaluated based on their accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. Ultimately, the vision transformer model was determined to be the most accurate, attaining an F1 score of 0.877 and an accuracy of 86.7% on the test set. The model, which was applied to unlabeled Twitter image data scraped from "#selfie", uncovered seasonal fluctuations in the relative abundance of pro-eating disorder content, which reached its peak in the summertime. These fluctuations correspond not only to the seasons, but also to stressors, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, the Twitter image data indicated that the relative amount of pro-eating disorder content has been steadily rising over the last five years and is likely to continue increasing in the future. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the proliferation of deep generative models, deepfakes are improving in quality and quantity everyday. However, there are subtle authenticity signals in pristine videos, not replicated by SOTA GANs. We contrast the movement in deepfakes and authentic videos by motion magnification towards building a generalized deepfake source detector. The sub-muscular motion in faces has different interpretations per different generative models which is reflected in their generative residue. Our approach exploits the difference between real motion and the amplified GAN fingerprints, by combining deep and traditional motion magnification, to detect whether a video is fake and its source generator if so. Evaluating our approach on two multi-source datasets, we obtain 97.17% and 94.03% for video source detection. We compare against the prior deepfake source detector and other complex architectures. We also analyze the importance of magnification amount, phase extraction window, backbone network architecture, sample counts, and sample lengths. Finally, we report our results for different skin tones to assess the bias. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Research into multi-modal perception, human cognition, behavior, and attention can benefit from high-fidelity content that may recreate real-life-like scenes when rendered on head-mounted displays. Moreover, aspects of audiovisual perception, cognitive processes, and behavior may complement questionnaire-based Quality of Experience (QoE) evaluation of interactive virtual environments. Currently, there is a lack of high-quality open-source audiovisual databases that can be used to evaluate such aspects or systems capable of reproducing high-quality content. With this paper, we provide a publicly available audiovisual database consisting of twelve scenes capturing real-life nature and urban environments with a video resolution of 7680x3840 at 60 frames-per-second and with 4th-order Ambisonics audio. These 360 video sequences, with an average duration of 60 seconds, represent real-life settings for systematically evaluating various dimensions of uni-/multi-modal perception, cognition, behavior, and QoE. The paper provides details of the scene requirements, recording approach, and scene descriptions. The database provides high-quality reference material with a balanced focus on auditory and visual sensory information. The database will be continuously updated with additional scenes and further metadata such as human ratings and saliency information. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Benefiting from its single-photon sensitivity, single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array has been widely applied in various fields such as fluorescence lifetime imaging and quantum computing. However, large-scale high-fidelity single-photon imaging remains a big challenge, due to the complex hardware manufacture craft and heavy noise disturbance of SPAD arrays. In this work, we introduce deep learning into SPAD, enabling super-resolution single-photon imaging over an order of magnitude, with significant enhancement of bit depth and imaging quality. We first studied the complex photon flow model of SPAD electronics to accurately characterize multiple physical noise sources, and collected a real SPAD image dataset (64 $\times$ 32 pixels, 90 scenes, 10 different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2790 images in total) to calibrate noise model parameters. With this real-world physical noise model, we for the first time synthesized a large-scale realistic single-photon image dataset (image pairs of 5 different resolutions with maximum megapixels, 17250 scenes, 10 different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2.6 million images in total) for subsequent network training. To tackle the severe super-resolution challenge of SPAD inputs with low bit depth, low resolution, and heavy noise, we further built a deep transformer network with a content-adaptive self-attention mechanism and gated fusion modules, which can dig global contextual features to remove multi-source noise and extract full-frequency details. We applied the technique on a series of experiments including macroscopic and microscopic imaging, microfluidic inspection, and Fourier ptychography. The experiments validate the technique's state-of-the-art super-resolution SPAD imaging performance, with more than 5 dB superiority on PSNR compared to the existing methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper proposes a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with a musical note position-aware attention mechanism for singing voice synthesis (SVS). A seq2seq modeling approach that can simultaneously perform acoustic and temporal modeling is attractive. However, due to the difficulty of the temporal modeling of singing voices, many recent SVS systems with an encoder-decoder-based model still rely on explicitly on duration information generated by additional modules. Although some studies perform simultaneous modeling using seq2seq models with an attention mechanism, they have insufficient robustness against temporal modeling. The proposed attention mechanism is designed to estimate the attention weights by considering the rhythm given by the musical score. Furthermore, several techniques are also introduced to improve the modeling performance of the singing voice. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model is effective in terms of both naturalness and robustness of timing. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning (DL) analysis of Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed tomography (CT) images has garnered a lot of attention in recent times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well suited for the image analysis tasks when trained on humongous amounts of data. Applications developed for medical image analysis require high sensitivity and precision compared to any other fields. Most of the tools proposed for detection of COVID-19 claims to have high sensitivity and recalls but have failed to generalize and perform when tested on unseen datasets. This encouraged us to develop a CNN model, analyze and understand the performance of it by visualizing the predictions of the model using class activation maps generated using (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) Grad-CAM technique. This study provides a detailed discussion of the success and failure of the proposed model at an image level. Performance of the model is compared with state-of-the-art DL models and shown to be comparable.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose a Siamese sleep transformer (SST) that effectively extracts features from single-channel raw electroencephalogram signals for robust sleep stage scoring. Despite the significant advances in sleep stage scoring in the last few years, most of them mainly focused on the increment of model performance. However, other problems still exist: the bias of labels in datasets and the instability of model performance by repetitive training. To alleviate these problems, we propose the SST, a novel sleep stage scoring model with a selective batch sampling strategy and self-knowledge distillation. To evaluate how robust the model was to the bias of labels, we used different datasets for training and testing: the sleep heart health study and the Sleep-EDF datasets. In this condition, the SST showed competitive performance in sleep stage scoring. In addition, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the selective batch sampling strategy with a reduction of the standard deviation of performance by repetitive training. These results could show that SST extracted effective learning features against the bias of labels in datasets, and the selective batch sampling strategy worked for the model robustness in training. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a ubiquitous diagnostic modality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied towards ECG analysis require large sample sizes, and transfer learning approaches result in suboptimal performance when pre-training is done on natural images. We leveraged masked image modeling to create the first vision-based transformer model, HeartBEiT, for electrocardiogram waveform analysis. We pre-trained this model on 8.5 million ECGs and then compared performance vs. standard CNN architectures for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, low left ventricular ejection fraction and ST elevation myocardial infarction using differing training sample sizes and independent validation datasets. We show that HeartBEiT has significantly higher performance at lower sample sizes compared to other models. Finally, we also show that HeartBEiT improves explainability of diagnosis by highlighting biologically relevant regions of the EKG vs. standard CNNs. Thus, we present the first vision-based waveform transformer that can be used to develop specialized models for ECG analysis especially at low sample sizes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
