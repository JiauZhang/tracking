        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Advances in computational methods and big data availability have recently translated into breakthroughs in AI applications. With successes in bottom-up challenges partially overshadowing shortcomings, the 'human-like' performance of Large Language Models has raised the question of how linguistic performance is achieved by algorithms. Given systematic shortcomings in generalization across many AI systems, in this work we ask whether linguistic performance is indeed guided by language knowledge in Large Language Models. To this end, we prompt GPT-3 with a grammaticality judgement task and comprehension questions on less frequent constructions that are thus unlikely to form part of Large Language Models' training data. These included grammatical 'illusions', semantic anomalies, complex nested hierarchies and self-embeddings. GPT-3 failed for every prompt but one, often offering answers that show a critical lack of understanding even of high-frequency words used in these less frequent grammatical constructions. The present work sheds light on the boundaries of the alleged AI human-like linguistic competence and argues that, far from human-like, the next-word prediction abilities of LLMs may face issues of robustness, when pushed beyond training data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Since its introduction in 2017, physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) has garnered growing popularity in understanding the evolution of systems governed by physical laws in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, empirical evidence points to the limitations of PIDL for learning certain types of PDEs. In this paper, we (a) present the challenges in training PIDL architecture, (b) contrast the performance of PIDL architecture in learning a first order scalar hyperbolic conservation law and its parabolic counterpart, (c) investigate the effect of training data sampling, which corresponds to various sensing scenarios in traffic networks, (d) comment on the implications of PIDL limitations for traffic flow estimation and prediction in practice. Detailed in the case study, we present the contradistinction in PIDL results between learning the traffic flow model (LWR PDE) and its variation with diffusion. The outcome indicates that PIDL experiences significant challenges in learning the hyperbolic LWR equation due to the non-smoothness of its solution. On the other hand, the architecture with parabolic PDE, augmented with the diffusion term, leads to the successful reassembly of the density data even with the shockwaves present. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Traffic prediction is a flourishing research field due to its importance in human mobility in the urban space. Despite this, existing studies only focus on short-term prediction of up to few hours in advance, with most being up to one hour only. Long-term traffic prediction can enable more comprehensive, informed, and proactive measures against traffic congestion and is therefore an important task to explore. In this paper, we explore the task of long-term traffic prediction; where we predict traffic up to 24 hours in advance. We note the weaknesses of existing models--which are based on recurrent structures--for long-term traffic prediction and propose a modified Transformer model ``TrafFormer". Experiments comparing our model with existing hybrid neural network models show the superiority of our model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Distinguishing among different marine benthic habitat characteristics is of key importance in a wide set of seabed operations ranging from installations of oil rigs to laying networks of cables and monitoring the impact of humans on marine ecosystems. The Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) is a widely used imaging sensor in this regard. It produces high-resolution seafloor maps by logging the intensities of sound waves reflected back from the seafloor. In this work, we leverage these acoustic intensity maps to produce pixel-wise categorization of different seafloor types. We propose a novel architecture adapted from the Vision Transformer (ViT) in an encoder-decoder framework. Further, in doing so, the applicability of ViTs is evaluated on smaller datasets. To overcome the lack of CNN-like inductive biases, thereby making ViTs more conducive to applications in low data regimes, we propose a novel feature extraction module to replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) block within transformer layers and a novel module to extract multiscale patch embeddings. A lightweight decoder is also proposed to complement this design in order to further boost multiscale feature extraction. With the modified architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art results and also meet real-time computational requirements.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Data multiplexing is a recently proposed method for improving a model's inference efficiency by processing multiple instances simultaneously using an ordered representation mixture. Prior work on data multiplexing only used task-specific Transformers without any pre-training, which limited their accuracy and generality. In this paper, we develop pre-trained multiplexed language models (MUX-PLMs) that can be widely finetuned on any downstream task. Our approach includes a three-stage training procedure and novel multiplexing and demultiplexing modules for improving throughput and downstream task accuracy. We demonstrate our method on BERT and ELECTRA pre-training objectives, with our MUX-BERT and MUX-ELECTRA models achieving 2x/5x inference speedup with a 2-4 \% drop in absolute performance on GLUE and 1-2 \% drop on token-level tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advancements in interpretability research made transformer language models more transparent. This progress led to a better understanding of their inner workings for toy and naturally occurring models. However, how these models internally process sentiment changes has yet to be sufficiently answered. In this work, we introduce a new interpretability tool called PCP ablation, where we replace modules with low-rank matrices based on the principal components of their activations, reducing model parameters and their behavior to essentials. We demonstrate PCP ablations on MLP and attention layers in backdoored toy, backdoored large, and naturally occurring models. We determine MLPs as most important for the backdoor mechanism and use this knowledge to remove, insert, and modify backdoor mechanisms with engineered replacements via PCP ablation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs), trained on a large-scale image dataset, can be a good approximator of the natural image manifold. GAN-inversion, using a pre-trained generator as a deep generative prior, is a promising tool for image restoration under corruptions. However, the performance of GAN-inversion can be limited by a lack of robustness to unknown gross corruptions, i.e., the restored image might easily deviate from the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a Robust GAN-inversion (RGI) method with a provable robustness guarantee to achieve image restoration under unknown \textit{gross} corruptions, where a small fraction of pixels are completely corrupted. Under mild assumptions, we show that the restored image and the identified corrupted region mask converge asymptotically to the ground truth. Moreover, we extend RGI to Relaxed-RGI (R-RGI) for generator fine-tuning to mitigate the gap between the GAN learned manifold and the true image manifold while avoiding trivial overfitting to the corrupted input image, which further improves the image restoration and corrupted region mask identification performance. The proposed RGI/R-RGI method unifies two important applications with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance: (i) mask-free semantic inpainting, where the corruptions are unknown missing regions, the restored background can be used to restore the missing content; (ii) unsupervised pixel-wise anomaly detection, where the corruptions are unknown anomalous regions, the retrieved mask can be used as the anomalous region's segmentation mask. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Despite the success of diffusion models (DMs), we still lack a thorough understanding of their latent space. While image editing with GANs builds upon latent space, DMs rely on editing the conditions such as text prompts. We present an unsupervised method to discover interpretable editing directions for the latent variables $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathcal{X}$ of DMs. Our method adopts Riemannian geometry between $\mathcal{X}$ and the intermediate feature maps $\mathcal{H}$ of the U-Nets to provide a deep understanding over the geometrical structure of $\mathcal{X}$. The discovered semantic latent directions mostly yield disentangled attribute changes, and they are globally consistent across different samples. Furthermore, editing in earlier timesteps edits coarse attributes, while ones in later timesteps focus on high-frequency details. We define the curvedness of a line segment between samples to show that $\mathcal{X}$ is a curved manifold. Experiments on different baselines and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even on Stable Diffusion. Our source code will be publicly available for the future researchers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer-based pre-trained models have achieved great improvements in semantic matching. However, existing models still suffer from insufficient ability to capture subtle differences. The modification, addition and deletion of words in sentence pairs may make it difficult for the model to predict their relationship. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Dual Path Modeling Framework to enhance the model's ability to perceive subtle differences in sentence pairs by separately modeling affinity and difference semantics. Based on dual-path modeling framework we design the Dual Path Modeling Network (DPM-Net) to recognize semantic relations. And we conduct extensive experiments on 10 well-studied semantic matching and robustness test datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed method achieves consistent improvements over baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Leveraging contextual knowledge has become standard practice in automated claim verification, yet the impact of temporal reasoning has been largely overlooked. Our study demonstrates that time positively influences the claim verification process of evidence-based fact-checking. The temporal aspects and relations between claims and evidence are first established through grounding on shared timelines, which are constructed using publication dates and time expressions extracted from their text. Temporal information is then provided to RNN-based and Transformer-based classifiers before or after claim and evidence encoding. Our time-aware fact-checking models surpass base models by up to 9% Micro F1 (64.17%) and 15% Macro F1 (47.43%) on the MultiFC dataset. They also outperform prior methods that explicitly model temporal relations between evidence. Our findings show that the presence of temporal information and the manner in which timelines are constructed greatly influence how fact-checking models determine the relevance and supporting or refuting character of evidence documents. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work presents a rigorous mathematical formulation for topology optimization of a macrostructure undergoing ductile failure. The prediction of ductile solid materials which exhibit dominant plastic deformation is an intriguingly challenging task and plays an extremely important role in various engineering applications. Here, we rely on the phase-field approach to fracture which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture failure phenomena in solids. The first objective is to optimize the topology of the structure in order to minimize its mass, while accounting for structural damage. To do so, the topological phase transition function (between solid and void phases) is introduced, thus resulting in an extension of all the governing equations. Our second objective is to additionally enhance the fracture resistance of the structure. Accordingly, two different formulations are proposed. One requires only the residual force vector of the deformation field as a constraint, while in the second formulation, the residual force vector of the deformation and phase-field fracture simultaneously have been imposed. An incremental minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to derive the governing equations. Here, the level-set-based topology optimization is employed to seek an optimal layout with smooth and clear boundaries. Sensitivities are derived using the analytical gradient-based adjoint method to update the level-set surface for both formulations. Here, the evolution of the level-set surface is realized by the reaction-diffusion equation to maximize the strain energy of the structure while a certain volume of design domain is prescribed. Several three-dimensional numerical examples are presented to substantiate our algorithmic developments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Past studies on the ICD coding problem focus on predicting clinical codes primarily based on the discharge summary. This covers only a small fraction of the notes generated during each hospital stay and leaves potential for improving performance by analysing all the available clinical notes. We propose a hierarchical transformer architecture that uses text across the entire sequence of clinical notes in each hospital stay for ICD coding, and incorporates embeddings for text metadata such as their position, time, and type of note. While using all clinical notes increases the quantity of data substantially, superconvergence can be used to reduce training costs. We evaluate the model on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our model exceeds the prior state-of-the-art when using only discharge summaries as input, and achieves further performance improvements when all clinical notes are used as input. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present multimodal conditioning modules (MCM) for enabling conditional image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. Previous multimodal synthesis works rely on training networks from scratch or fine-tuning pretrained networks, both of which are computationally expensive for large, state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our method uses pretrained networks but does not require any updates to the diffusion network's parameters. MCM is a small module trained to modulate the diffusion network's predictions during sampling using 2D modalities (e.g., semantic segmentation maps, sketches) that were unseen during the original training of the diffusion model. We show that MCM enables user control over the spatial layout of the image and leads to increased control over the image generation process. Training MCM is cheap as it does not require gradients from the original diffusion net, consists of only $\sim$1$\%$ of the number of parameters of the base diffusion model, and is trained using only a limited number of training examples. We evaluate our method on unconditional and text-conditional models to demonstrate the improved control over the generated images and their alignment with respect to the conditioning inputs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are able to generate human-like, fluent responses for many downstream tasks, e.g., task-oriented dialog and question answering. However, applying LLMs to real-world, mission-critical applications remains challenging mainly due to their tendency to generate hallucinations and inability to use external knowledge.This paper proposes a LLM-Augmenter system, which augments a black-box LLM with a set of plug-and-play modules. Our system makes the LLM generate responses grounded in consolidated external knowledge, e.g., stored in task-specific databases. It also iteratively revises LLM prompts to improve model responses using feedback generated by utility functions, e.g., the factuality score of a LLM-generated response. The effectiveness of LLM-Augmenter is empirically validated on two types of mission-critical scenarios, task-oriented dialog and open-domain question answering. LLM-Augmenter significantly reduces ChatGPT's hallucinations without sacrificing the fluency and informativeness of its responses. We make the source code and models publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Since its foundations, more than one hundred years ago, the field of structural biology has strived to understand and analyze the properties of molecules and their interactions by studying the structure that they take in 3D space. However, a fundamental challenge with this approach has been the dynamic nature of these particles, which forces us to model not a single but a whole distribution of structures for every molecular system. This thesis proposes Intrinsic Diffusion Modeling, a novel approach to this problem based on combining diffusion generative models with scientific knowledge about the flexibility of biological complexes. The knowledge of these degrees of freedom is translated into the definition of a manifold over which the diffusion process is defined. This manifold significantly reduces the dimensionality and increases the smoothness of the generation space allowing for significantly faster and more accurate generative processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two fundamental tasks at the basis of computational chemistry and biology: molecular conformer generation and molecular docking. In both tasks, we construct the first deep learning method to outperform traditional computational approaches achieving an unprecedented level of accuracy for scalable programs. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Disease severity regression by a convolutional neural network (CNN) for medical images requires a sufficient number of image samples labeled with severity levels. Conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based data augmentation (DA) is a possible solution, but it encounters two issues. The first issue is that existing cGANs cannot deal with real-valued severity levels as their conditions, and the second is that the severity of the generated images is not fully reliable. We propose continuous DA as a solution to the two issues. Our method uses continuous severity GAN to generate images at real-valued severity levels and dataset-disjoint multi-objective optimization to deal with the second issue. Our method was evaluated for estimating ulcerative colitis (UC) severity of endoscopic images and achieved higher classification performance than conventional DA methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Protein language models have excelled in a variety of tasks, ranging from structure prediction to protein engineering. However, proteins are highly diverse in functions and structures, and current state-of-the-art models including the latest version of AlphaFold rely on Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) to feed in the evolutionary knowledge. Despite their success, heavy computational overheads, as well as the de novo and orphan proteins remain great challenges in protein representation learning. In this work, we show that MSAaugmented models inherently belong to retrievalaugmented methods. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Retrieved Sequence Augmentation(RSA) for protein representation learning without additional alignment or pre-processing. RSA links query protein sequences to a set of sequences with similar structures or properties in the database and combines these sequences for downstream prediction. We show that protein language models benefit from the retrieval enhancement on both structure prediction and property prediction tasks, with a 5% improvement on MSA Transformer on average while being 373 times faster. In addition, we show that our model can transfer to new protein domains better and outperforms MSA Transformer on de novo protein prediction. Our study fills a much-encountered gap in protein prediction and brings us a step closer to demystifying the domain knowledge needed to understand protein sequences.
