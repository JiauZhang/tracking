        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large multilingual models have inspired a new class of word alignment methods, which work well for the model's pretraining languages. However, the languages most in need of automatic alignment are low-resource and, thus, not typically included in the pretraining data. In this work, we ask: How do modern aligners perform on unseen languages, and are they better than traditional methods? We contribute gold-standard alignments for Bribri--Spanish, Guarani--Spanish, Quechua--Spanish, and Shipibo-Konibo--Spanish. With these, we evaluate state-of-the-art aligners with and without model adaptation to the target language. Finally, we also evaluate the resulting alignments extrinsically through two downstream tasks: named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. We find that although transformer-based methods generally outperform traditional models, the two classes of approach remain competitive with each other. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large, transformer-based pretrained language models like BERT, GPT, and T5 have demonstrated a deep understanding of contextual semantics and language syntax. Their success has enabled significant advances in conversational AI, including the development of open-dialogue systems capable of coherent, salient conversations which can answer questions, chat casually, and complete tasks. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle with tasks that involve higher levels of reasoning - including commonsense reasoning that humans find trivial. This paper presents a survey of recent conversational AI research focused on commonsense reasoning. The paper lists relevant training datasets and describes the primary approaches to include commonsense in conversational AI. The paper also discusses benchmarks used for evaluating commonsense in conversational AI problems. Finally, the paper presents preliminary observations of the limited commonsense capabilities of two state-of-the-art open dialogue models, BlenderBot3 and LaMDA, and its negative effect on natural interactions. These observations further motivate research on commonsense reasoning in conversational AI. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Consider the task of recognizing different animals. Current augmentations fail to produce diversity in task-relevant high-level semantic attributes like the species of the animal. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on image classification tasks in a few-shot setting, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Mathematical language in scientific communications and educational scenarios is important yet relatively understudied compared to natural languages. Recent works on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone mathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or mathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works on jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply treat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid structural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical expression generation tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high quality and creative images conditioned on text. An interesting application of such models is structure preserving text guided image editing. Existing approaches rely on text conditioned diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion or Imagen and require compute intensive optimization of text embeddings or fine-tuning the model weights for text guided image editing. We explore text guided image editing with a Hybrid Diffusion Model (HDM) architecture similar to DALLE-2. Our architecture consists of a diffusion prior model that generates CLIP image embedding conditioned on a text prompt and a custom Latent Diffusion Model trained to generate images conditioned on CLIP image embedding. We discover that the diffusion prior model can be used to perform text guided conceptual edits on the CLIP image embedding space without any finetuning or optimization. We combine this with structure preserving edits on the image decoder using existing approaches such as reverse DDIM to perform text guided image editing. Our approach, PRedItOR does not require additional inputs, fine-tuning, optimization or objectives and shows on par or better results than baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. We provide further analysis and understanding of the diffusion prior model and believe this opens up new possibilities in diffusion models research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a comprehensive study on applying machine learning to detect distributed Denial of service (DDoS) attacks using large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems. While prior works and existing DDoS attacks have largely focused on individual nodes transmitting packets at a high volume, we investigate more sophisticated futuristic attacks that use large numbers of IoT devices and camouflage their attack by having each node transmit at a volume typical of benign traffic. We introduce new correlation-aware architectures that take into account the correlation of traffic across IoT nodes, and we also compare the effectiveness of centralized and distributed detection models. We extensively analyze the proposed architectures by evaluating five different neural network models trained on a dataset derived from a 4060-node real-world IoT system. We observe that long short-term memory (LSTM) and a transformer-based model, in conjunction with the architectures that use correlation information of the IoT nodes, provide higher performance (in terms of F1 score and binary accuracy) than the other models and architectures, especially when the attacker camouflages itself by following benign traffic distribution on each transmitting node. For instance, by using the LSTM model, the distributed correlation-aware architecture gives 81% F1 score for the attacker that camouflages their attack with benign traffic as compared to 35% for the architecture that does not use correlation information. We also investigate the performance of heuristics for selecting a subset of nodes to share their data for correlation-aware architectures to meet resource constraints. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce \`A-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT), a transformer-based scheme to tune prompts on distinct data so that they can be arbitrarily composed at inference time. The individual prompts can be trained in isolation, possibly on different devices, at different times, and on different distributions or domains. Furthermore each prompt only contains information about the subset of data it was exposed to during training. During inference, models can be assembled based on arbitrary selections of data sources, which we call "\`a-la-carte learning". \`A-la-carte learning enables constructing bespoke models specific to each user's individual access rights and preferences. We can add or remove information from the model by simply adding or removing the corresponding prompts without retraining from scratch. We demonstrate that \`a-la-carte built models achieve accuracy within $5\%$ of models trained on the union of the respective sources, with comparable cost in terms of training and inference time. For the continual learning benchmarks Split CIFAR-100 and CORe50, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human activity recognition is a core technology for applications such as rehabilitation, ambient health monitoring, and human-computer interactions. Wearable devices, particularly IMU sensors, can help us collect rich features of human movements that can be leveraged in activity recognition. Developing a robust classifier for activity recognition has always been of interest to researchers. One major problem is that there is usually a deficit of training data for some activities, making it difficult and sometimes impossible to develop a classifier. In this work, a novel GAN network called TheraGAN was developed to generate realistic IMU signals associated with a particular activity. The generated signal is of a 6-channel IMU. i.e., angular velocities and linear accelerations. Also, by introducing simple activities, which are meaningful subparts of a complex full-length activity, the generation process was facilitated for any activity with arbitrary length. To evaluate the generated signals, besides perceptual similarity metrics, they were applied along with real data to improve the accuracy of classifiers. The results show that the maximum increase in the f1-score belongs to the LSTM classifier by a 13.27% rise when generated data were added. This shows the validity of the generated data as well as TheraGAN as a tool to build more robust classifiers in case of imbalanced data problem. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Operator splitting is a popular divide-and-conquer strategy for solving differential equations. Typically, the right-hand side of the differential equation is split into a number of parts that can then be integrated separately. Many methods are known that split the right-hand side into two parts. This approach is limiting, however, and there are situations when 3-splitting is more natural and ultimately more advantageous. The second-order Strang operator-splitting method readily generalizes to a right-hand side splitting into any number of operators. It is arguably the most popular method for 3-splitting because of its efficiency, ease of implementation, and intuitive nature. Other 3-splitting methods exist, but they are less well-known, and evaluations of their performance in practice are scarce. We demonstrate the effectiveness of some alternative 3-split, second-order methods to Strang splitting on two problems: the reaction-diffusion Brusselator, which can be split into three parts that each have closed-form solutions, and the kinetic Vlasov--Poisson equations that is used in semi-Lagrangian plasma simulations. We find alternative second-order 3-operator-splitting methods that realize efficiency gains of 10\%--20\% over traditional Strang splitting. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: One-shot image generation (OSG) with generative adversarial networks that learn from the internal patches of a given image has attracted world wide attention. In recent studies, scholars have primarily focused on extracting features of images from probabilistically distributed inputs with pure convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it is quite difficult for CNNs with limited receptive domain to extract and maintain the global structural information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel structure-preserved method TcGAN with individual vision transformer to overcome the shortcomings of the existing one-shot image generation methods. Specifically, TcGAN preserves global structure of an image during training to be compatible with local details while maintaining the integrity of semantic-aware information by exploiting the powerful long-range dependencies modeling capability of the transformer. We also propose a new scaling formula having scale-invariance during the calculation period, which effectively improves the generated image quality of the OSG model on image super-resolution tasks. We present the design of the TcGAN converter framework, comprehensive experimental as well as ablation studies demonstrating the ability of TcGAN to achieve arbitrary image generation with the fastest running time. Lastly, TcGAN achieves the most excellent performance in terms of applying it to other image processing tasks, e.g., super-resolution as well as image harmonization, the results further prove its superiority. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most of existing RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) methods follow the CNN-based paradigm, which is unable to model long-range dependencies across space and modalities due to the natural locality of CNNs. Here we propose the Hierarchical Cross-modal Transformer (HCT), a new multi-modal transformer, to tackle this problem. Unlike previous multi-modal transformers that directly connecting all patches from two modalities, we explore the cross-modal complementarity hierarchically to respect the modality gap and spatial discrepancy in unaligned regions. Specifically, we propose to use intra-modal self-attention to explore complementary global contexts, and measure spatial-aligned inter-modal attention locally to capture cross-modal correlations. In addition, we present a Feature Pyramid module for Transformer (FPT) to boost informative cross-scale integration as well as a consistency-complementarity module to disentangle the multi-modal integration path and improve the fusion adaptivity. Comprehensive experiments on a large variety of public datasets verify the efficacy of our designs and the consistent improvement over state-of-the-art models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Exploiting spatial-angular correlation is crucial to light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR), but is highly challenging due to its non-local property caused by the disparities among LF images. Although many deep neural networks (DNNs) have been developed for LF image SR and achieved continuously improved performance, existing methods cannot well leverage the long-range spatial-angular correlation and thus suffer a significant performance drop when handling scenes with large disparity variations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to learn the non-local spatial-angular correlation for LF image SR. In our method, we adopt the epipolar plane image (EPI) representation to project the 4D spatial-angular correlation onto multiple 2D EPI planes, and then develop a Transformer network with repetitive self-attention operations to learn the spatial-angular correlation by modeling the dependencies between each pair of EPI pixels. Our method can fully incorporate the information from all angular views while achieving a global receptive field along the epipolar line. We conduct extensive experiments with insightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method. Comparative results on five public datasets show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art SR performance, but also performs robust to disparity variations.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Existing work in document-level neural machine translation commonly concatenates several consecutive sentences as a pseudo-document, and then learns inter-sentential dependencies. This strategy limits the model's ability to leverage information from distant context. We overcome this limitation with a novel Document Flattening (DocFlat) technique that integrates Flat-Batch Attention (FBA) and Neural Context Gate (NCG) into Transformer model to utilize information beyond the pseudo-document boundaries. FBA allows the model to attend to all the positions in the batch and learns the relationships between positions explicitly and NCG identifies the useful information from the distant context. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analyses on three benchmark datasets for English-German translation, and validate the effectiveness of two variants of DocFlat. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms strong baselines with statistical significance on BLEU, COMET and accuracy on the contrastive test set. The analyses highlight that DocFlat is highly effective in capturing the long-range information. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text summarization has been a crucial problem in natural language processing (NLP) for several decades. It aims to condense lengthy documents into shorter versions while retaining the most critical information. Various methods have been proposed for text summarization, including extractive and abstractive summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and ChatGPT has recently created significant interest in using these models for text summarization tasks. Recent studies \cite{goyal2022news, zhang2023benchmarking} have shown that LLMs-generated news summaries are already on par with humans. However, the performance of LLMs for more practical applications like aspect or query-based summaries is underexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on four widely used benchmark datasets, encompassing diverse summaries from Reddit posts, news articles, dialogue meetings, and stories. Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT's performance is comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods in terms of Rouge scores. Moreover, we highlight some unique differences between ChatGPT-generated summaries and human references, providing valuable insights into the superpower of ChatGPT for diverse text summarization tasks. Our findings call for new directions in this area, and we plan to conduct further research to systematically examine the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated summaries through extensive human evaluation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a general and unified computational framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various inference tasks (e.g., computing marginal probabilities). Towards enabling such reasoning capabilities in complex real-world tasks, Liu et al. (2022) propose to distill knowledge (through latent variable assignments) from less tractable but more expressive deep generative models. However, it is still unclear what factors make this distillation work well. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically discover that the performance of a PC can exceed that of its teacher model. Therefore, instead of performing distillation from the most expressive deep generative model, we study what properties the teacher model and the PC should have in order to achieve good distillation performance. This leads to a generic algorithmic improvement as well as other data-type-specific ones over the existing latent variable distillation pipeline. Empirically, we outperform SoTA TPMs by a large margin on challenging image modeling benchmarks. In particular, on ImageNet32, PCs achieve 4.06 bits-per-dimension, which is only 0.34 behind variational diffusion models (Kingma et al., 2021). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) aims to infer speech into text depending on lip movements alone. As it focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements, and this makes the VSR models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen speakers. In this paper, to remedy the performance degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically, motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover, by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is an emerging research spot aimed at inexpensively adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Recent advances have achieved great success in saving storage costs for various vision tasks by updating or injecting a small number of parameters instead of full fine-tuning. However, we notice that most existing PETL methods still incur non-negligible latency during inference. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient and computationally friendly adapter for giant vision models, called RepAdapter. Specifically, we prove that the adaption modules, even with a complex structure, can be seamlessly integrated into most giant vision models via structural re-parameterization. This property makes RepAdapter zero-cost during inference. In addition to computation efficiency, RepAdapter is more effective and lightweight than existing PETL methods due to its sparse structure and our careful deployment. To validate RepAdapter, we conduct extensive experiments on 27 benchmark datasets of three vision tasks, i.e., image and video classifications and semantic segmentation. Experimental results show the superior performance and efficiency of RepAdapter than the state-of-the-art PETL methods. For instance, by updating only 0.6% parameters, we can improve the performance of ViT from 38.8 to 55.1 on Sun397. Its generalizability is also well validated by a bunch of vision models, i.e., ViT, CLIP, Swin-Transformer and ConvNeXt.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in text-to-image generation with diffusion models present transformative capabilities in image quality. However, user controllability of the generated image, and fast adaptation to new tasks still remains an open challenge, currently mostly addressed by costly and long re-training and fine-tuning or ad-hoc adaptations to specific image generation tasks. In this work, we present MultiDiffusion, a unified framework that enables versatile and controllable image generation, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, without any further training or finetuning. At the center of our approach is a new generation process, based on an optimization task that binds together multiple diffusion generation processes with a shared set of parameters or constraints. We show that MultiDiffusion can be readily applied to generate high quality and diverse images that adhere to user-provided controls, such as desired aspect ratio (e.g., panorama), and spatial guiding signals, ranging from tight segmentation masks to bounding boxes.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper studies a mechanism design problem over a network, where agents can only participate by referrals. The Bulow-Klemberer theorem proposes that expanding the number of participants is a more effective approach to increase revenue than modifying the auction format. However, agents lack the motivation to invite others because doing so intensifies competition among them. On the other hand, misreporting social networks is also a common problem that can reduce revenue. Examples of misreporting include Sybil attacks (an agent pretending to be multiple bidders) and coalition groups (multiple agents pretending to be an agent). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel mechanism called the Truthful Referral Diffusion Mechanism (TRDM). TRDM incentivizes agents to report their social networks truthfully, and some of them are rewarded by the seller for improving revenue. In spite of the fact that some agents overbid in TRDM, the revenue is fixed, and it is higher than the revenue of any mechanism without referrals. TRDM is budget-balanced (non-negative revenue) and generates an efficient outcome (maximized social welfare), making it attractive for both the seller and the buyers as it improves revenue and reward. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work aims to estimate a high-quality depth map from a single RGB image. Due to the lack of depth clues, making full use of the long-range correlation and the local information is critical for accurate depth estimation. Towards this end, we introduce an uncertainty rectified cross-distillation between Transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a unified depth estimator. Specifically, we use the depth estimates derived from the Transformer branch and the CNN branch as pseudo labels to teach each other. Meanwhile, we model the pixel-wise depth uncertainty to rectify the loss weights of noisy depth labels. To avoid the large performance gap induced by the strong Transformer branch deteriorating the cross-distillation, we transfer the feature maps from Transformer to CNN and design coupling units to assist the weak CNN branch to utilize the transferred features. Furthermore, we propose a surprisingly simple yet highly effective data augmentation technique CutFlip, which enforces the model to exploit more valuable clues apart from the clue of vertical image position for depth estimation. Extensive experiments indicate that our model, termed~\textbf{URCDC-Depth}, exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI and NYU-Depth-v2 datasets, even with no additional computational burden at inference time.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural network-based Combinatorial Optimization (CO) methods have shown promising results in solving various NP-complete (NPC) problems without relying on hand-crafted domain knowledge. This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions. We investigate two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively, and devise an effective inference schedule to enhance the solution quality. We evaluate our methods on two well-studied NPC combinatorial optimization problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS). Experimental results show that DIFUSCO strongly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers, improving the performance gap between ground-truth and neural solvers from 1.76% to 0.46% on TSP-500, from 2.46% to 1.17% on TSP-1000, and from 3.19% to 2.58% on TSP10000. For the MIS problem, DIFUSCO outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solver on the challenging SATLIB benchmark.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Inspired by retrieval-augmented language generation and pretrained Vision and Language (V&amp;L) encoders, we present a new approach to image captioning that generates sentences given the input image and a set of captions retrieved from a datastore, as opposed to the image alone. The encoder in our model jointly processes the image and retrieved captions using a pretrained V&amp;L BERT, while the decoder attends to the multimodal encoder representations, benefiting from the extra textual evidence from the retrieved captions. Experimental results on the COCO dataset show that image captioning can be effectively formulated from this new perspective. Our model, named EXTRA, benefits from using captions retrieved from the training dataset, and it can also benefit from using an external dataset without the need for retraining. Ablation studies show that retrieving a sufficient number of captions (e.g., k=5) can improve captioning quality. Our work contributes towards using pretrained V&amp;L encoders for generative tasks, instead of standard classification tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Comprehending human motion is a fundamental challenge for developing Human-Robot Collaborative applications. Computer vision researchers have addressed this field by only focusing on reducing error in predictions, but not taking into account the requirements to facilitate its implementation in robots. In this paper, we propose a new model based on Transformer that simultaneously deals with the real time 3D human motion forecasting in the short and long term. Our 2-Channel Transformer (2CH-TR) is able to efficiently exploit the spatio-temporal information of a shortly observed sequence (400ms) and generates a competitive accuracy against the current state-of-the-art. 2CH-TR stands out for the efficient performance of the Transformer, being lighter and faster than its competitors. In addition, our model is tested in conditions where the human motion is severely occluded, demonstrating its robustness in reconstructing and predicting 3D human motion in a highly noisy environment. Our experiment results show that the proposed 2CH-TR outperforms the ST-Transformer, which is another state-of-the-art model based on the Transformer, in terms of reconstruction and prediction under the same conditions of input prefix. Our model reduces in 8.89% the mean squared error of ST-Transformer in short-term prediction, and 2.57% in long-term prediction in Human3.6M dataset with 400ms input prefix. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Applying powerful generative denoising diffusion models (DDMs) for downstream tasks such as image semantic editing usually requires either fine-tuning pre-trained DDMs or learning auxiliary editing networks. In this work, we achieve SOTA semantic control performance on various application settings by optimizing the denoising trajectory solely via frozen DDMs. As one of the first optimization-based diffusion editing work, we start by seeking a more comprehensive understanding of the intermediate high-dimensional latent spaces by theoretically and empirically analyzing their probabilistic and geometric behaviors in the Markov chain. We then propose to further explore the critical step in the denoising trajectory that characterizes the convergence of a pre-trained DDM. Last but not least, we further present our method to search for the semantic subspaces boundaries for controllable manipulation, by guiding the denoising trajectory towards the targeted boundary at the critical convergent step. We conduct extensive experiments on various DPMs architectures (DDPM, iDDPM) and datasets (CelebA, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-church, LSUN-bedroom, AFHQ-dog) with different resolutions (64, 256) as empirical demonstrations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Data-hunger and data-imbalance are two major pitfalls in many deep learning approaches. For example, on highly optimized production lines, defective samples are hardly acquired while non-defective samples come almost for free. The defects however often seem to resemble each other, e.g., scratches on different products may only differ in a few characteristics. In this work, we introduce a framework, Defect Transfer GAN (DT-GAN), which learns to represent defect types independent of and across various background products and yet can apply defect-specific styles to generate realistic defective images. An empirical study on the MVTec AD and two additional datasets showcase DT-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image synthesis methods w.r.t. sample fidelity and diversity in defect generation. We further demonstrate benefits for a critical downstream task in manufacturing -- defect classification. Results show that the augmented data from DT-GAN provides consistent gains even in the few samples regime and reduces the error rate up to 51% compared to both traditional and advanced data augmentation methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

We mainly discuss the vision transformer for the image classification task. Our contribution is to introduce an efficient 360 framework, which includes various aspects of the vision transformer, to make it more efficient for industrial applications. By considering those applications, we categorize them into multiple dimensions such as privacy, robustness, transparency, fairness, inclusiveness, continual learning, probabilistic models, approximation, computational complexity, and spectral complexity. We compare various vision transformer models based on their performance, the number of parameters, and the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) on multiple datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work we tackle the problem of estimating the density $f_X$ of a random variable $X$ by successive smoothing, such that the smoothed random variable $Y$ fulfills $(\partial_t - \Delta_1)f_Y(\,\cdot\,, t) = 0$, $f_Y(\,\cdot\,, 0) = f_X$. With a focus on image processing, we propose a product/fields of experts model with Gaussian mixture experts that admits an analytic expression for $f_Y (\,\cdot\,, t)$ under an orthogonality constraint on the filters. This construction naturally allows the model to be trained simultaneously over the entire diffusion horizon using empirical Bayes. We show preliminary results on image denoising where our model leads to competitive results while being tractable, interpretable, and having only a small number of learnable parameters. As a byproduct, our model can be used for reliable noise estimation, allowing blind denoising of images corrupted by heteroscedastic noise. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The incredible generative ability of large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has demonstrated strong power of learning complex structures and meaningful semantics. However, relying solely on text prompts cannot fully take advantage of the knowledge learned by the model, especially when flexible and accurate structure control is needed. In this paper, we aim to ``dig out" the capabilities that T2I models have implicitly learned, and then explicitly use them to control the generation more granularly. Specifically, we propose to learn simple and small T2I-Adapters to align internal knowledge in T2I models with external control signals, while freezing the original large T2I models. In this way, we can train various adapters according to different conditions, and achieve rich control and editing effects. Further, the proposed T2I-Adapters have attractive properties of practical value, such as composability and generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T2I-Adapter has promising generation quality and a wide range of applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study black-box model stealing attacks where the attacker can query a machine learning model only through publicly available APIs. Specifically, our aim is to design a black-box model extraction attack that uses minimal number of queries to create an informative and distributionally equivalent replica of the target model. First, we define distributionally equivalent and max-information model extraction attacks. Then, we reduce both the attacks into a variational optimisation problem. The attacker solves this problem to select the most informative queries that simultaneously maximise the entropy and reduce the mismatch between the target and the stolen models. This leads us to an active sampling-based query selection algorithm, Marich. We evaluate Marich on different text and image data sets, and different models, including BERT and ResNet18. Marich is able to extract models that achieve $69-96\%$ of true model's accuracy and uses $1,070 - 6,950$ samples from the publicly available query datasets, which are different from the private training datasets. Models extracted by Marich yield prediction distributions, which are $\sim2-4\times$ closer to the target's distribution in comparison to the existing active sampling-based algorithms. The extracted models also lead to $85-95\%$ accuracy under membership inference attacks. Experimental results validate that Marich is query-efficient, and also capable of performing task-accurate, high-fidelity, and informative model extraction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reconstructing a 3D object from a 2D image is a well-researched vision problem, with many kinds of deep learning techniques having been tried. Most commonly, 3D convolutional approaches are used, though previous work has shown state-of-the-art methods using 2D convolutions that are also significantly more efficient to train. With the recent rise of transformers for vision tasks, often outperforming convolutional methods, along with some earlier attempts to use transformers for 3D object reconstruction, we set out to use visual transformers in place of convolutions in existing efficient, high-performing techniques for 3D object reconstruction in order to achieve superior results on the task. Using a transformer-based encoder and decoder to predict 3D structure from 2D images, we achieve accuracy similar or superior to the baseline approach. This study serves as evidence for the potential of visual transformers in the task of 3D object reconstruction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: There has been tremendous progress in large-scale text-to-image synthesis driven by diffusion models enabling versatile downstream applications such as 3D object synthesis from texts, image editing, and customized generation. We present a generic approach using latent diffusion models as powerful image priors for various visual synthesis tasks. Existing methods that utilize such priors fail to use these models' full capabilities. To improve this, our core ideas are 1) a feature matching loss between features from different layers of the decoder to provide detailed guidance and 2) a KL divergence loss to regularize the predicted latent features and stabilize the training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on three different applications, text-to-3D, StyleGAN adaptation, and layered image editing. Extensive results show our method compares favorably against baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we extend the unified kinetic particle (UGKP) method to the frequency-dependent radiative transfer equation with both absorption-emission and scattering processes. The extended UGKP method could not only capture the diffusion and free transport limit, but also provide a smooth transition in the physical and frequency space in the regime between the above two limits. The proposed scheme has the properties of asymptotic-preserving, regime-adaptive, and entropy-preserving, which make it an accurate and efficient scheme in the simulation of multiscale photon transport problems. The methodology of scheme construction is a coupled evolution of macroscopic energy equation and the microscopic radiant intensity equation, where the numerical flux in macroscopic energy equation and the closure in microscopic radiant intensity equation are constructed based on the integral solution. Both numerical dissipation and computational complexity are well controlled especially in the optical thick regime. A 2D multi-thread code on a general unstructured mesh has been developed. Several numerical tests have been simulated to verify the numerical scheme and code, covering a wide range of flow regimes. The numerical scheme and code that we developed are highly demanded and widely applicable in the high energy density engineering applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
