### [MTMD: Multi-Scale Temporal Memory Learning and Efficient Debiasing  Framework for Stock Trend Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08656)
Recently, machine learning methods have shown the prospects of stock trend forecasting. However, the volatile and dynamic nature of the stock market makes it difficult to directly apply machine learning techniques. Previous methods usually use the temporal information of historical stock price patterns to predict future stock trends, but the multi-scale temporal dependence of financial data and stable trading opportunities are still difficult to capture. The main problem can be ascribed to the challenge of recognizing the patterns of real profit signals from noisy information. In this paper, we propose a framework called Multiscale Temporal Memory Learning and Efficient Debiasing (MTMD). Specifically, through self-similarity, we design a learnable embedding with external attention as memory block, in order to reduce the noise issues and enhance the temporal consistency of the model. This framework not only aggregates comprehensive local information in each timestamp, but also concentrates the global important historical patterns in the whole time stream. Meanwhile, we also design the graph network based on global and local information to adaptively fuse the heterogeneous multi-scale information. Extensive ablation studies and experiments demonstrate that MTMD outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin on the benchmark datasets. The source code of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/MingjieWang0606/MDMT-Public. 

### [Hard Sample Aware Network for Contrastive Deep Graph Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08665)
Contrastive deep graph clustering, which aims to divide nodes into disjoint groups via contrastive mechanisms, is a challenging research spot. Among the recent works, hard sample mining-based algorithms have achieved great attention for their promising performance. However, we find that the existing hard sample mining methods have two problems as follows. 1) In the hardness measurement, the important structural information is overlooked for similarity calculation, degrading the representativeness of the selected hard negative samples. 2) Previous works merely focus on the hard negative sample pairs while neglecting the hard positive sample pairs. Nevertheless, samples within the same cluster but with low similarity should also be carefully learned. To solve the problems, we propose a novel contrastive deep graph clustering method dubbed Hard Sample Aware Network (HSAN) by introducing a comprehensive similarity measure criterion and a general dynamic sample weighing strategy. Concretely, in our algorithm, the similarities between samples are calculated by considering both the attribute embeddings and the structure embeddings, better revealing sample relationships and assisting hardness measurement. Moreover, under the guidance of the carefully collected high-confidence clustering information, our proposed weight modulating function will first recognize the positive and negative samples and then dynamically up-weight the hard sample pairs while down-weighting the easy ones. In this way, our method can mine not only the hard negative samples but also the hard positive sample, thus improving the discriminative capability of the samples further. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method. 

### [Plansformer: Generating Symbolic Plans using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08681)
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the subject of active research, significantly advancing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). From BERT to BLOOM, LLMs have surpassed state-of-the-art results in various natural language tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation. Many ongoing efforts focus on understanding LLMs' capabilities, including their knowledge of the world, syntax, and semantics. However, extending the textual prowess of LLMs to symbolic reasoning has been slow and predominantly focused on tackling problems related to the mathematical field. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automated planning - a branch of AI concerned with the realization of action sequences (plans) to achieve a goal, typically executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles. We introduce Plansformer; an LLM fine-tuned on planning problems and capable of generating plans with favorable behavior in terms of correctness and length with reduced knowledge-engineering efforts. We also demonstrate the adaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varying complexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For one configuration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95% are optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain. 

### [Uncovering the Disentanglement Capability in Text-to-Image Diffusion  Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08698)
Generative models have been widely studied in computer vision. Recently, diffusion models have drawn substantial attention due to the high quality of their generated images. A key desired property of image generative models is the ability to disentangle different attributes, which should enable modification towards a style without changing the semantic content, and the modification parameters should generalize to different images. Previous studies have found that generative adversarial networks (GANs) are inherently endowed with such disentanglement capability, so they can perform disentangled image editing without re-training or fine-tuning the network. In this work, we explore whether diffusion models are also inherently equipped with such a capability. Our finding is that for stable diffusion models, by partially changing the input text embedding from a neutral description (e.g., "a photo of person") to one with style (e.g., "a photo of person with smile") while fixing all the Gaussian random noises introduced during the denoising process, the generated images can be modified towards the target style without changing the semantic content. Based on this finding, we further propose a simple, light-weight image editing algorithm where the mixing weights of the two text embeddings are optimized for style matching and content preservation. This entire process only involves optimizing over around 50 parameters and does not fine-tune the diffusion model itself. Experiments show that the proposed method can modify a wide range of attributes, with the performance outperforming diffusion-model-based image-editing algorithms that require fine-tuning. The optimized weights generalize well to different images. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/DiffusionDisentanglement. 

### ['Rarely' a problem? Language models exhibit inverse scaling in their  predictions following 'few'-type quantifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08700)
Language Models appear to perform poorly on quantification. We ask how badly. 'Few'-type quantifiers, as in 'few children like vegetables' might pose a particular challenge for Language Models, since the sentence components without the quantifier are likely to co-occur, and because 'few'-type quantifiers are rare. We present 960 sentences stimuli from two human neurolinguistic experiments to 22 autoregressive transformer models of differing sizes. Not only do the models perform poorly on 'few'-type quantifiers, but overall the larger the model, the worse its performance. We interpret this inverse scaling as suggesting that larger models increasingly reflect online rather than offline human processing, and argue that decreasing performance of larger models may challenge uses of Language Models as the basis for Natural Language Systems. 

### [Attentiveness Map Estimation for Haptic Teleoperation of Mobile Robot  Obstacle Avoidance and Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08742)
Haptic feedback can improve safety of teleoperated robots when situational awareness is limited or operators are inattentive. Standard potential field approaches increase haptic resistance as an obstacle is approached, which is desirable when the operator is unaware of the obstacle but undesirable when the movement is intentional, such as when the operator wishes to inspect or manipulate an object. This paper presents a novel haptic teleoperation framework that estimates the operator's attentiveness to dampen haptic feedback for intentional movement. A biologically-inspired attention model is developed based on computational working memory theories to integrate visual saliency estimation with spatial mapping. This model generates an attentiveness map in real-time, and the haptic rendering system generates lower haptic forces for obstacles that the operator is estimated to be aware of. Experimental results in simulation show that the proposed framework outperforms haptic teleoperation without attentiveness estimation in terms of task performance, robot safety, and user experience. 

### [Point-E: A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08751)
While recent work on text-conditional 3D object generation has shown promising results, the state-of-the-art methods typically require multiple GPU-hours to produce a single sample. This is in stark contrast to state-of-the-art generative image models, which produce samples in a number of seconds or minutes. In this paper, we explore an alternative method for 3D object generation which produces 3D models in only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU. Our method first generates a single synthetic view using a text-to-image diffusion model, and then produces a 3D point cloud using a second diffusion model which conditions on the generated image. While our method still falls short of the state-of-the-art in terms of sample quality, it is one to two orders of magnitude faster to sample from, offering a practical trade-off for some use cases. We release our pre-trained point cloud diffusion models, as well as evaluation code and models, at https://github.com/openai/point-e. 

### [A Survey on Password Guessing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08796)
Text password has served as the most popular method for user authentication so far, and is not likely to be totally replaced in foreseeable future. Password authentication offers several desirable properties (e.g., low-cost, highly available, easy-to-implement, reusable). However, it suffers from a critical security issue mainly caused by the inability to memorize complicated strings of human. Users tend to choose easy-to-remember passwords which are not uniformly distributed in the key space, and are susceptible to guessing attack. In order to encourage and support users to use strong passwords, it is necessary to simulate automate password guessing methods to determine the passwords' strength and identify weak passwords. A large number of password guessing models have been proposed in the literature. However, little attention was paid on the task of providing a systematic survey which is necessary to review the state-of-the-art approaches, identify gaps, and avoid duplicate study. Motivated from that, we conduct a comprehensive survey on all password guessing studies presented in the literature from 1979 to 2022. We propose a generic methodology map of existing models to present an overview of this field, then, subsequently explain each approach in detail. The experimental procedures and available datasets used for evaluating password guessing models are summarized, along with the reported performances of representative studies. Finally, the current limitations and the open problems as future research directions are discussed. We believe that this survey is helpful to both the experts and newcomers who are interested in password security. 

### [Leveraging Wastewater Monitoring for COVID-19 Forecasting in the US: a  Deep Learning study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08798)
The outburst of COVID-19 in late 2019 was the start of a health crisis that shook the world and took millions of lives in the ensuing years. Many governments and health officials failed to arrest the rapid circulation of infection in their communities. The long incubation period and the large proportion of asymptomatic cases made COVID-19 particularly elusive to track. However, wastewater monitoring soon became a promising data source in addition to conventional indicators such as confirmed daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Despite the consensus on the effectiveness of wastewater viral load data, there is a lack of methodological approaches that leverage viral load to improve COVID-19 forecasting. This paper proposes using deep learning to automatically discover the relationship between daily confirmed cases and viral load data. We trained one Deep Temporal Convolutional Networks (DeepTCN) and one Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to build a global forecasting model. We supplement the daily confirmed cases with viral loads and other socio-economic factors as covariates to the models. Our results suggest that TFT outperforms DeepTCN and learns a better association between viral load and daily cases. We demonstrated that equipping the models with the viral load improves their forecasting performance significantly. Moreover, viral load is shown to be the second most predictive input, following the containment and health index. Our results reveal the feasibility of training a location-agnostic deep-learning model to capture the dynamics of infection diffusion when wastewater viral load data is provided. 

### [Inductive Attention for Video Action Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08830)
Anticipating future actions based on video observations is an important task in video understanding, which would be useful for some precautionary systems that require response time to react before an event occurs. Since the input in action anticipation is only pre-action frames, models do not have enough information about the target action; moreover, similar pre-action frames may lead to different futures. Consequently, any solution using existing action recognition models can only be suboptimal. Recently, researchers have proposed using a longer video context to remedy the insufficient information in pre-action intervals, as well as the self-attention to query past relevant moments to address the anticipation problem. However, the indirect use of video input features as the query might be inefficient, as it only serves as the proxy to the anticipation goal. To this end, we propose an inductive attention model, which transparently uses prior prediction as the query to derive the anticipation result by induction from past experience. Our method naturally considers the uncertainty of multiple futures via the many-to-many association. On the large-scale egocentric video datasets, our model not only shows consistently better performance than state of the art using the same backbone, and is competitive to the methods that employ a stronger backbone, but also superior efficiency in less model parameters. 

### [DAG: Depth-Aware Guidance with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08861)
In recent years, generative models have undergone significant advancement due to the success of diffusion models. The success of these models is often attributed to their use of guidance techniques, such as classifier and classifier-free methods, which provides effective mechanisms to trade-off between fidelity and diversity. However, these methods are not capable of guiding a generated image to be aware of its geometric configuration, e.g., depth, which hinders the application of diffusion models to areas that require a certain level of depth awareness. To address this limitation, we propose a novel guidance approach for diffusion models that uses estimated depth information derived from the rich intermediate representations of diffusion models. To do this, we first present a label-efficient depth estimation framework using the internal representations of diffusion models. At the sampling phase, we utilize two guidance techniques to self-condition the generated image using the estimated depth map, the first of which uses pseudo-labeling, and the subsequent one uses a depth-domain diffusion prior. Experiments and extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in guiding the diffusion models toward geometrically plausible image generation.

### [Controlling Styles in Neural Machine Translation with Activation Prompt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08909)
Neural machine translation(NMT) has aroused wide attention due to its impressive quality. Beyond quality, controlling translation styles is also an important demand for many languages. Previous related studies mainly focus on controlling formality and gain some improvements. However, they still face two challenges. The first is the evaluation limitation. Style contains abundant information including lexis, syntax, etc. But only formality is well studied. The second is the heavy reliance on iterative fine-tuning when new styles are required. Correspondingly, this paper contributes in terms of the benchmark and approach. First, we re-visit this task and propose a multiway stylized machine translation (MSMT) benchmark, which includes multiple categories of styles in four language directions to push the boundary of this task. Second, we propose a method named style activation prompt (StyleAP) by retrieving prompts from stylized monolingual corpus, which needs no extra fine-tuning. Experiments show that StyleAP could effectively control the style of translation and achieve remarkable performance. All of our data and code are released at https://github.com/IvanWang0730/StyleAP. 

### [Analyzing the Traffic of MANETs using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08923)
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been taking role in many areas, thanks to their expressive power on graph-structured data. On the other hand, Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) are gaining attention as network technologies have been taken to the 5G level. However, there is no study that evaluates the efficiency of GNNs on MANETs. In this study, we aim to fill this absence by implementing a MANET dataset in a popular GNN framework, i.e., PyTorch Geometric; and show how GNNs can be utilized to analyze the traffic of MANETs. We operate an edge prediction task on the dataset with GraphSAGE (SAG) model, where SAG model tries to predict whether there is a link between two nodes. We construe several evaluation metrics to measure the performance and efficiency of GNNs on MANETs. SAG model showed 82.1 accuracy on average in the experiments. 

### [Graph Learning: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08966)
Graph learning aims to learn complex relationships among nodes and the topological structure of graphs, such as social networks, academic networks and e-commerce networks, which are common in the real world. Those relationships make graphs special compared with traditional tabular data in which nodes are dependent on non-Euclidean space and contain rich information to explore. Graph learning developed from graph theory to graph data mining and now is empowered with representation learning, making it achieve great performances in various scenarios, even including text, image, chemistry, and biology. Due to the broad application prospects in the real world, graph learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Thousands of works have been proposed to solve various kinds of problems in graph learning and is appealing more and more attention in academic community, which makes it pivotal to survey previous valuable works. Although some of the researchers have noticed this phenomenon and finished impressive surveys on graph learning. However, they failed to link related objectives, methods and applications in a more logical way and cover current ample scenarios as well as challenging problems due to the rapid expansion of the graph learning. 

### [Efficient Image Captioning for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08985)
Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress of image captioning. However, the demands for large memory storage and heavy computational burden prevent these captioning models from being deployed on mobile devices. The main obstacles lie in the heavyweight visual feature extractors (i.e., object detectors) and complicated cross-modal fusion networks. To this end, we propose LightCap, a lightweight image captioner for resource-limited devices. The core design is built on the recent CLIP model for efficient image captioning. To be specific, on the one hand, we leverage the CLIP model to extract the compact grid features without relying on the time-consuming object detectors. On the other hand, we transfer the image-text retrieval design of CLIP to image captioning scenarios by devising a novel visual concept extractor and a cross-modal modulator. We further optimize the cross-modal fusion model and parallel prediction heads via sequential and ensemble distillations. With the carefully designed architecture, our model merely contains 40M parameters, saving the model size by more than 75% and the FLOPs by more than 98% in comparison with the current state-of-the-art methods. In spite of the low capacity, our model still exhibits state-of-the-art performance on prevalent datasets, e.g., 136.6 CIDEr on COCO Karpathy test split. Testing on the smartphone with only a single CPU, the proposed LightCap exhibits a fast inference speed of 188ms per image, which is ready for practical applications. 

### [Deep learning applied to computational mechanics: A comprehensive  review, state of the art, and the classics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08989)
Three recent breakthroughs due to AI in arts and science serve as motivation: An award winning digital image, protein folding, fast matrix multiplication. Many recent developments in artificial neural networks, particularly deep learning (DL), applied and relevant to computational mechanics (solid, fluids, finite-element technology) are reviewed in detail. Both hybrid and pure machine learning (ML) methods are discussed. Hybrid methods combine traditional PDE discretizations with ML methods either (1) to help model complex nonlinear constitutive relations, (2) to nonlinearly reduce the model order for efficient simulation (turbulence), or (3) to accelerate the simulation by predicting certain components in the traditional integration methods. Here, methods (1) and (2) relied on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, with method (3) relying on convolutional neural networks.. Pure ML methods to solve (nonlinear) PDEs are represented by Physics-Informed Neural network (PINN) methods, which could be combined with attention mechanism to address discontinuous solutions. Both LSTM and attention architectures, together with modern and generalized classic optimizers to include stochasticity for DL networks, are extensively reviewed. Kernel machines, including Gaussian processes, are provided to sufficient depth for more advanced works such as shallow networks with infinite width. Not only addressing experts, readers are assumed familiar with computational mechanics, but not with DL, whose concepts and applications are built up from the basics, aiming at bringing first-time learners quickly to the forefront of research. History and limitations of AI are recounted and discussed, with particular attention at pointing out misstatements or misconceptions of the classics, even in well-known references. Positioning and pointing control of a large-deformable beam is given as an example. 

### [PoE: a Panel of Experts for Generalized Automatic Dialogue Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08992)
Chatbots are expected to be knowledgeable across multiple domains, e.g. for daily chit-chat, exchange of information, and grounding in emotional situations. To effectively measure the quality of such conversational agents, a model-based automatic dialogue evaluation metric (ADEM) is expected to perform well across multiple domains. Despite significant progress, an ADEM that works well in one domain does not necessarily generalize to another. This calls for a dedicated network architecture for domain generalization. To tackle the multi-domain dialogue evaluation task, we propose a Panel of Experts (PoE), a multitask network that consists of a shared transformer encoder and a collection of lightweight adapters. The shared encoder captures the general knowledge of dialogues across domains, while each adapter specializes in one specific domain and serves as a domain expert. To validate the idea, we construct a high-quality multi-domain dialogue dataset leveraging data augmentation and pseudo-labeling. The PoE network is comprehensively assessed on 16 dialogue evaluation datasets spanning a wide range of dialogue domains. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean Spearman correlation over all the evaluation datasets. It exhibits better zero-shot generalization than existing state-of-the-art ADEMs and the ability to easily adapt to new domains with few-shot transfer learning. 

### [Neural Coreference Resolution based on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09028)
The target of a coreference resolution system is to cluster all mentions that refer to the same entity in a given context. All coreference resolution systems need to solve two subtasks; one task is to detect all of the potential mentions, and the other is to learn the linking of an antecedent for each possible mention. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning actor-critic-based neural coreference resolution system, which can achieve both mention detection and mention clustering by leveraging an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning technique and a joint training algorithm. We experiment on the BERT model to generate different input span representations. Our model with the BERT span representation achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the models on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English Test Set. 

### [Contextually Enhanced ES-dRNN with Dynamic Attention for Short-Term Load  Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09030)
In this paper, we propose a new short-term load forecasting (STLF) model based on contextually enhanced hybrid and hierarchical architecture combining exponential smoothing (ES) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The model is composed of two simultaneously trained tracks: the context track and the main track. The context track introduces additional information to the main track. It is extracted from representative series and dynamically modulated to adjust to the individual series forecasted by the main track. The RNN architecture consists of multiple recurrent layers stacked with hierarchical dilations and equipped with recently proposed attentive dilated recurrent cells. These cells enable the model to capture short-term, long-term and seasonal dependencies across time series as well as to weight dynamically the input information. The model produces both point forecasts and predictive intervals. The experimental part of the work performed on 35 forecasting problems shows that the proposed model outperforms in terms of accuracy its predecessor as well as standard statistical models and state-of-the-art machine learning models. 

### [Multi-embodiment Legged Robot Control as a Sequence Modeling Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09078)
Robots are traditionally bounded by a fixed embodiment during their operational lifetime, which limits their ability to adapt to their surroundings. Co-optimizing control and morphology of a robot, however, is often inefficient due to the complex interplay between the controller and morphology. In this paper, we propose a learning-based control method that can inherently take morphology into consideration such that once the control policy is trained in the simulator, it can be easily deployed to robots with different embodiments in the real world. In particular, we present the Embodiment-aware Transformer (EAT), an architecture that casts this control problem as conditional sequence modeling. EAT outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired robot embodiment, past states, and actions, our EAT model can generate future actions that best fit the current robot embodiment. Experimental results show that EAT can outperform all other alternatives in embodiment-varying tasks, and succeed in an example of real-world evolution tasks: stepping down a stair through updating the morphology alone. We hope that EAT will inspire a new push toward real-world evolution across many domains, where algorithms like EAT can blaze a trail by bridging the field of evolutionary robotics and big data sequence modeling. 

### [Rethinking the Role of Scale for In-Context Learning: An  Interpretability-based Case Study at 66 Billion Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09095)
Language models have been shown to perform better with an increase in scale on a wide variety of tasks via the in-context learning paradigm. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that the ability of a large language model to in-context learn-perform a task is not uniformly spread across all of its underlying components. Using a 66 billion parameter language model (OPT-66B) across a diverse set of 14 downstream tasks, we find this is indeed the case: $\sim$70% of attention heads and $\sim$20% of feed forward networks can be removed with minimal decline in task performance. We find substantial overlap in the set of attention heads (un)important for in-context learning across tasks and number of in-context examples. We also address our hypothesis through a task-agnostic lens, finding that a small set of attention heads in OPT-66B score highly on their ability to perform primitive induction operations associated with in-context learning, namely, prefix matching and copying. These induction heads overlap with task-specific important heads, suggesting that induction heads are among the heads capable of more sophisticated behaviors associated with in-context learning. Overall, our study provides several insights that indicate large language models may be under-trained to perform in-context learning and opens up questions on how to pre-train language models to more effectively perform in-context learning. 

### [Mask-FPAN: Semi-Supervised Face Parsing in the Wild With De-Occlusion  and UV GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09098)
Fine-grained semantic segmentation of a person's face and head, including facial parts and head components, has progressed a great deal in recent years. However, it remains a challenging task, whereby considering ambiguous occlusions and large pose variations are particularly difficult. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel framework termed Mask-FPAN. It uses a de-occlusion module that learns to parse occluded faces in a semi-supervised way. In particular, face landmark localization, face occlusionstimations, and detected head poses are taken into account. A 3D morphable face model combined with the UV GAN improves the robustness of 2D face parsing. In addition, we introduce two new datasets named FaceOccMask-HQ and CelebAMaskOcc-HQ for face paring work. The proposed Mask-FPAN framework addresses the face parsing problem in the wild and shows significant performance improvements with MIOU from 0.7353 to 0.9013 compared to the state-of-the-art on challenging face datasets. 

### [A Generalized Framework for Critical Heat Flux Detection Using  Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09107)
This work proposes a framework developed to generalize Critical Heat Flux (CHF) detection classification models using an Unsupervised Image-to-Image (UI2I) translation model. The framework enables a typical classification model that was trained and tested on boiling images from domain A to predict boiling images coming from domain B that was never seen by the classification model. This is done by using the UI2I model to transform the domain B images to look like domain A images that the classification model is familiar with. Although CNN was used as the classification model and Fixed-Point GAN (FP-GAN) was used as the UI2I model, the framework is model agnostic. Meaning, that the framework can generalize any image classification model type, making it applicable to a variety of similar applications and not limited to the boiling crisis detection problem. It also means that the more the UI2I models advance, the better the performance of the framework. 

### [Curriculum Sampling for Dense Retrieval with Document Expansion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09114)
The dual-encoder has become the de facto architecture for dense retrieval. Typically, it computes the latent representations of the query and document independently, thus failing to fully capture the interactions between the query and document. To alleviate this, recent work expects to get query-informed representations of documents. During training, it expands the document with a real query, while replacing the real query with a generated pseudo query at inference. This discrepancy between training and inference makes the dense retrieval model pay more attention to the query information but ignore the document when computing the document representation. As a result, it even performs worse than the vanilla dense retrieval model, since its performance depends heavily on the relevance between the generated queries and the real query. In this paper, we propose a curriculum sampling strategy, which also resorts to the pseudo query at training and gradually increases the relevance of the generated query to the real query. In this way, the retrieval model can learn to extend its attention from the document only to both the document and query, hence getting high-quality query-informed document representations. Experimental results on several passage retrieval datasets show that our approach outperforms the previous dense retrieval methods1. 

### [Rainproof: An Umbrella To Shield Text Generators From  Out-Of-Distribution Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09171)
As more and more conversational and translation systems are deployed in production, it is essential to implement and to develop effective control mechanisms guaranteeing their proper functioning and security. An essential component to ensure safe system behavior is out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which aims at detecting whether an input sample is statistically far from the training distribution. Although OOD detection is a widely covered topic in classification tasks, it has received much less attention in text generation. This paper addresses the problem of OOD detection for machine translation and dialog generation from an operational perspective. Our contributions include: (i) RAINPROOF a Relative informAItioN Projection ODD detection framework; and (ii) a more operational evaluation setting for OOD detection. Surprisingly, we find that OOD detection is not necessarily aligned with task-specific measures. The OOD detector may filter out samples that are well processed by the model and keep samples that are not, leading to weaker performance. Our results show that RAINPROOF breaks this curse and achieve good results in OOD detection while increasing performance. 

### [Photo-Realistic Out-of-domain GAN inversion via Invertibility  Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09262)
The fidelity of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) inversion is impeded by Out-Of-Domain (OOD) areas (e.g., background, accessories) in the image. Detecting the OOD areas beyond the generation ability of the pretrained model and blending these regions with the input image can enhance fidelity. The ``invertibility mask" figures out these OOD areas, and existing methods predict the mask with the reconstruction error. However, the estimated mask is usually inaccurate due to the influence of the reconstruction error in the In-Domain (ID) area. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances the fidelity of human face inversion by designing a new module to decompose the input images to ID and OOD partitions with invertibility masks. Unlike previous works, our invertibility detector is simultaneously learned with a spatial alignment module. We iteratively align the generated features to the input geometry and reduce the reconstruction error in the ID regions. Thus, the OOD areas are more distinguishable and can be precisely predicted. Then, we improve the fidelity of our results by blending the OOD areas from the input image with the ID GAN inversion results. Our method produces photo-realistic results for real-world human face image inversion and manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority over existing methods in the quality of GAN inversion and attribute manipulation. 

### [Detecting Features Concerning Privacy From App Reviews](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09289)
Privacy requirements not only relate to legal compliance but also influence user satisfaction. Massive rapidly increasing App reviews have been proved a valuable requirements knowledge repository. Existing studies on App reviews mining have made much effort to automatically extract various requirements related information, e.g., feature request, bug report, and user opinions. However, less attention has been paid to privacy requirements refinement based on user reviews mining, which is beneficial for addressing users' privacy concern. In this work, we aim to detect privacy related features from App reviews to facilitate software maintenance activities. To that end, we design a semi-automatic framework to identify privacy related reviews from which App features are extracted and mapped to those listed in App descriptions. Firstly, we combine information retrieval and supervised text classification to identify privacy related reviews. Then, we design a dependency parsing method to extract App features from those privacy related reviews. Finally, those automatically extracted features are matched with those manually annotated ones in App descriptions based on phrase similarity. We quantitatively evaluate the three components of our framework on the reviews of Apps from multiple categories. For privacy related reviews identification, Gradient Boosting classifier achieves the highest F1 score of 93.77\% among other competitive algorithms including deep learning ones. On App feature extraction, our dependency parsing based method can achieve a recall of 85.63\%, more than 20\% higher than the baseline. For feature matching, the phrase embedding cosine similarity shows the best matching result among four types of similarity methods, obtaining an average accuracy of 57\%. We finally discuss the potential applications of our framework in detecting feature problems that may cause privacy threats. 

### [Synthetic Data Augmentation Using GAN For Improved Automated Visual  Inspection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09317)
Quality control is a crucial activity performed by manufacturing companies to ensure their products conform to the requirements and specifications. The introduction of artificial intelligence models enables to automate the visual quality inspection, speeding up the inspection process and ensuring all products are evaluated under the same criteria. In this research, we compare supervised and unsupervised defect detection techniques and explore data augmentation techniques to mitigate the data imbalance in the context of automated visual inspection. Furthermore, we use Generative Adversarial Networks for data augmentation to enhance the classifiers' discriminative performance. Our results show that state-of-the-art unsupervised defect detection does not match the performance of supervised models but can be used to reduce the labeling workload by more than 50%. Furthermore, the best classification performance was achieved considering GAN-based data generation with AUC ROC scores equal to or higher than 0,9898, even when increasing the dataset imbalance by leaving only 25\% of the images denoting defective products. We performed the research with real-world data provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV. 

### [SrTR: Self-reasoning Transformer with Visual-linguistic Knowledge for  Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09329)
Objects in a scene are not always related. The execution efficiency of the one-stage scene graph generation approaches are quite high, which infer the effective relation between entity pairs using sparse proposal sets and a few queries. However, they only focus on the relation between subject and object in triplet set subject entity, predicate entity, object entity, ignoring the relation between subject and predicate or predicate and object, and the model lacks self-reasoning ability. In addition, linguistic modality has been neglected in the one-stage method. It is necessary to mine linguistic modality knowledge to improve model reasoning ability. To address the above-mentioned shortcomings, a Self-reasoning Transformer with Visual-linguistic Knowledge (SrTR) is proposed to add flexible self-reasoning ability to the model. An encoder-decoder architecture is adopted in SrTR, and a self-reasoning decoder is developed to complete three inferences of the triplet set, s+o-p, s+p-o and p+o-s. Inspired by the large-scale pre-training image-text foundation models, visual-linguistic prior knowledge is introduced and a visual-linguistic alignment strategy is designed to project visual representations into semantic spaces with prior knowledge to aid relational reasoning. Experiments on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the superiority and fast inference ability of the proposed method. 

### [StyleTRF: Stylizing Tensorial Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09330)
Stylized view generation of scenes captured casually using a camera has received much attention recently. The geometry and appearance of the scene are typically captured as neural point sets or neural radiance fields in the previous work. An image stylization method is used to stylize the captured appearance by training its network jointly or iteratively with the structure capture network. The state-of-the-art SNeRF method trains the NeRF and stylization network in an alternating manner. These methods have high training time and require joint optimization. In this work, we present StyleTRF, a compact, quick-to-optimize strategy for stylized view generation using TensoRF. The appearance part is fine-tuned using sparse stylized priors of a few views rendered using the TensoRF representation for a few iterations. Our method thus effectively decouples style-adaption from view capture and is much faster than the previous methods. We show state-of-the-art results on several scenes used for this purpose. 

### [Enriching Relation Extraction with OpenIE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09376)
Relation extraction (RE) is a sub-discipline of information extraction (IE) which focuses on the prediction of a relational predicate from a natural-language input unit (such as a sentence, a clause, or even a short paragraph consisting of multiple sentences and/or clauses). Together with named-entity recognition (NER) and disambiguation (NED), RE forms the basis for many advanced IE tasks such as knowledge-base (KB) population and verification. In this work, we explore how recent approaches for open information extraction (OpenIE) may help to improve the task of RE by encoding structured information about the sentences' principal units, such as subjects, objects, verbal phrases, and adverbials, into various forms of vectorized (and hence unstructured) representations of the sentences. Our main conjecture is that the decomposition of long and possibly convoluted sentences into multiple smaller clauses via OpenIE even helps to fine-tune context-sensitive language models such as BERT (and its plethora of variants) for RE. Our experiments over two annotated corpora, KnowledgeNet and FewRel, demonstrate the improved accuracy of our enriched models compared to existing RE approaches. Our best results reach 92% and 71% of F1 score for KnowledgeNet and FewRel, respectively, proving the effectiveness of our approach on competitive benchmarks. 

### [Cognitive Accident Prediction in Driving Scenes: A Multimodality  Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09381)
Traffic accident prediction in driving videos aims to provide an early warning of the accident occurrence, and supports the decision making of safe driving systems. Previous works usually concentrate on the spatial-temporal correlation of object-level context, while they do not fit the inherent long-tailed data distribution well and are vulnerable to severe environmental change. In this work, we propose a Cognitive Accident Prediction (CAP) method that explicitly leverages human-inspired cognition of text description on the visual observation and the driver attention to facilitate model training. In particular, the text description provides a dense semantic description guidance for the primary context of the traffic scene, while the driver attention provides a traction to focus on the critical region closely correlating with safe driving. CAP is formulated by an attentive text-to-vision shift fusion module, an attentive scene context transfer module, and the driver attention guided accident prediction module. We leverage the attention mechanism in these modules to explore the core semantic cues for accident prediction. In order to train CAP, we extend an existing self-collected DADA-2000 dataset (with annotated driver attention for each frame) with further factual text descriptions for the visual observations before the accidents. Besides, we construct a new large-scale benchmark consisting of 11,727 in-the-wild accident videos with over 2.19 million frames (named as CAP-DATA) together with labeled fact-effect-reason-introspection description and temporal accident frame label. Based on extensive experiments, the superiority of CAP is validated compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The code, CAP-DATA, and all results will be released in \url{https://github.com/JWFanggit/LOTVS-CAP}. 

### [Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09410)
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used for text classification tasks as they usually achieve high levels of accuracy. However, DNNs can be computationally intensive with billions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that's easy, light-weight and universal in text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a $k$-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training, pre-training or fine-tuning, our method achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distributed datasets. It even outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages. Our method also performs particularly well in few-shot settings where labeled data are too scarce for DNNs to achieve a satisfying accuracy. 

### [Difformer: Empowering Diffusion Model on Embedding Space for Text  Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09412)
Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art synthesis quality on visual and audio tasks, and recent works adapt them to textual data by diffusing on the embedding space. But the difference between the continuous data space and the embedding space raises challenges to the diffusion model, which have not been carefully explored. In this paper, we conduct systematic studies and analyze the challenges threefold. Firstly, the data distribution is learnable for embeddings, which may lead to the collapse of the loss function. Secondly, as the norm of embedding varies between popular and rare words, adding the same noise scale will lead to sub-optimal results. In addition, we find that noises sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution may distract the diffusion process. To solve the above challenges, we propose Difformer, a denoising diffusion probabilistic model based on Transformer, which consists of three techniques including utilizing an anchor loss function, a layer normalization module for embeddings, and a norm factor to the Gaussian noise. All techniques are complementary to each other and critical to boosting the model performance together. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets over two seminal text generation tasks including machine translation and text summarization. The results show that Difformer significantly outperforms the embedding diffusion baselines, while achieving competitive results with strong autoregressive baselines. 

### [Improving Pre-Trained Weights Through Meta-Heuristics Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09447)
Machine Learning algorithms have been extensively researched throughout the last decade, leading to unprecedented advances in a broad range of applications, such as image classification and reconstruction, object recognition, and text categorization. Nonetheless, most Machine Learning algorithms are trained via derivative-based optimizers, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent, leading to possible local optimum entrapments and inhibiting them from achieving proper performances. A bio-inspired alternative to traditional optimization techniques, denoted as meta-heuristic, has received significant attention due to its simplicity and ability to avoid local optimums imprisonment. In this work, we propose to use meta-heuristic techniques to fine-tune pre-trained weights, exploring additional regions of the search space, and improving their effectiveness. The experimental evaluation comprises two classification tasks (image and text) and is assessed under four literature datasets. Experimental results show nature-inspired algorithms' capacity in exploring the neighborhood of pre-trained weights, achieving superior results than their counterpart pre-trained architectures. Additionally, a thorough analysis of distinct architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron and Recurrent Neural Networks, attempts to visualize and provide more precise insights into the most critical weights to be fine-tuned in the learning process. 

### [Smart Journey in Istanbul: A Mobile Application in Smart Cities for  Traffic Estimation by Harnessing Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09448)
In recent decades, mobile applications (apps) have gained enormous popularity. Smart services for smart cities increasingly gain attention. The main goal of the proposed research is to present a new AI-powered mobile application on Istanbul's traffic congestion forecast by using traffic density data. It addresses the research question by using time series approaches (LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost) based on past data over the traffic load dataset combined with meteorological conditions. Analysis of simulation results on predicted models will be discussed according to performance indicators such as MAPE, MAE, and RMSE. And then, it was observed that the Transformer model made the most accurate traffic prediction. The developed traffic forecasting prototype is expected to be a starting point on future products for a mobile application suitable for citizens' daily use. 

### [Latent Diffusion for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09462)
Diffusion models have achieved great success in modeling continuous data modalities such as images, audio, and video, but have seen limited use in discrete domains such as language. Recent attempts to adapt diffusion to language have presented diffusion as an alternative to autoregressive language generation. We instead view diffusion as a complementary method that can augment the generative capabilities of existing pre-trained language models. We demonstrate that continuous diffusion models can be learned in the latent space of a pre-trained encoder-decoder model, enabling us to sample continuous latent representations that can be decoded into natural language with the pre-trained decoder. We show that our latent diffusion models are more effective at sampling novel text from data distributions than a strong autoregressive baseline and also enable controllable generation. 

### [Improving the Generalizability of Text-Based Emotion Detection by  Leveraging Transformers with Psycholinguistic Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09465)
In recent years, there has been increased interest in building predictive models that harness natural language processing and machine learning techniques to detect emotions from various text sources, including social media posts, micro-blogs or news articles. Yet, deployment of such models in real-world sentiment and emotion applications faces challenges, in particular poor out-of-domain generalizability. This is likely due to domain-specific differences (e.g., topics, communicative goals, and annotation schemes) that make transfer between different models of emotion recognition difficult. In this work we propose approaches for text-based emotion detection that leverage transformer models (BERT and RoBERTa) in combination with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks trained on a comprehensive set of psycholinguistic features. First, we evaluate the performance of our models within-domain on two benchmark datasets: GoEmotion and ISEAR. Second, we conduct transfer learning experiments on six datasets from the Unified Emotion Dataset to evaluate their out-of-domain robustness. We find that the proposed hybrid models improve the ability to generalize to out-of-distribution data compared to a standard transformer-based approach. Moreover, we observe that these models perform competitively on in-domain data. 

### [MM-Diffusion: Learning Multi-Modal Diffusion Models for Joint Audio and  Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09478)
We propose the first joint audio-video generation framework that brings engaging watching and listening experiences simultaneously, towards high-quality realistic videos. To generate joint audio-video pairs, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion model (i.e., MM-Diffusion), with two-coupled denoising autoencoders. In contrast to existing single-modal diffusion models, MM-Diffusion consists of a sequential multi-modal U-Net for a joint denoising process by design. Two subnets for audio and video learn to gradually generate aligned audio-video pairs from Gaussian noises. To ensure semantic consistency across modalities, we propose a novel random-shift based attention block bridging over the two subnets, which enables efficient cross-modal alignment, and thus reinforces the audio-video fidelity for each other. Extensive experiments show superior results in unconditional audio-video generation, and zero-shot conditional tasks (e.g., video-to-audio). In particular, we achieve the best FVD and FAD on Landscape and AIST++ dancing datasets. Turing tests of 10k votes further demonstrate dominant preferences for our model. The code and pre-trained models can be downloaded at https://github.com/researchmm/MM-Diffusion. 

### [Performance assessment and exhaustive listing of 500+ nature inspired  metaheuristic algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09479)
Metaheuristics are popularly used in various fields, and they have attracted much attention in the scientific and industrial communities. In recent years, the number of new metaheuristic names has been continuously growing. Generally, the inventors attribute the novelties of these new algorithms to inspirations from either biology, human behaviors, physics, or other phenomena. In addition, these new algorithms, compared against basic versions of other metaheuristics using classical benchmark problems without shift/rotation, show competitive performances. In this study, we exhaustively tabulate more than 500 metaheuristics. To comparatively evaluate the performance of the recent competitive variants and newly proposed metaheuristics, 11 newly proposed metaheuristics and 4 variants of established metaheuristics are comprehensively compared on the CEC2017 benchmark suite. In addition, whether these algorithms have a search bias to the center of the search space is investigated. The results show that the performance of the newly proposed EBCM (effective butterfly optimizer with covariance matrix adaptation) algorithm performs comparably to the 4 well performing variants of the established metaheuristics and possesses similar properties and behaviors, such as convergence, diversity, exploration and exploitation trade-offs, in many aspects. The performance of all 15 of the algorithms is likely to deteriorate due to certain transformations, while the 4 state-of-the-art metaheuristics are less affected by transformations such as the shifting of the global optimal point away from the center of the search space. It should be noted that, except EBCM, the other 10 new algorithms proposed mostly during 2019-2020 are inferior to the well performing 2017 variants of differential evolution and evolution strategy in terms of convergence speed and global search ability on CEC 2017 functions. 

### [Feature Disentanglement Learning with Switching and Aggregation for  Video-based Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09498)
In video person re-identification (Re-ID), the network must consistently extract features of the target person from successive frames. Existing methods tend to focus only on how to use temporal information, which often leads to networks being fooled by similar appearances and same backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a Disentanglement and Switching and Aggregation Network (DSANet), which segregates the features representing identity and features based on camera characteristics, and pays more attention to ID information. We also introduce an auxiliary task that utilizes a new pair of features created through switching and aggregation to increase the network's capability for various camera scenarios. Furthermore, we devise a Target Localization Module (TLM) that extracts robust features against a change in the position of the target according to the frame flow and a Frame Weight Generation (FWG) that reflects temporal information in the final representation. Various loss functions for disentanglement learning are designed so that each component of the network can cooperate while satisfactorily performing its own role. Quantitative and qualitative results from extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DSANet over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets. 

### [CLIP is Also an Efficient Segmenter: A Text-Driven Approach for Weakly  Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09506)
Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is a challenging task in computer vision. Mainstream approaches follow a multi-stage framework and suffer from high training costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training models (CLIP) to localize different categories with only image-level labels and without any further training. To efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks from CLIP, we propose a novel framework called CLIP-ES for WSSS. Our framework improves all three stages of WSSS with special designs for CLIP: 1) We introduce the softmax function into GradCAM and exploit the zero-shot ability of CLIP to suppress the confusion caused by non-target classes and backgrounds. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of CLIP, we re-explore text inputs under the WSSS setting and customize two text-driven strategies: sharpness-based prompt selection and synonym fusion. 2) To simplify the stage of CAM refinement, we propose a real-time class-aware attention-based affinity (CAA) module based on the inherent multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in CLIP-ViTs. 3) When training the final segmentation model with the masks generated by CLIP, we introduced a confidence-guided loss (CGL) to mitigate noise and focus on confident regions. Our proposed framework dramatically reduces the cost of training for WSSS and shows the capability of localizing objects in CLIP. Our CLIP-ES achieves SOTA performance on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 while only taking 10% time of previous methods for the pseudo mask generation. Code is available at https://github.com/linyq2117/CLIP-ES. 

### [Rethinking Label Smoothing on Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09512)
Label smoothing is a regularization technique widely used in supervised learning to improve the generalization of models on various tasks, such as image classification and machine translation. However, the effectiveness of label smoothing in multi-hop question answering (MHQA) has yet to be well studied. In this paper, we systematically analyze the role of label smoothing on various modules of MHQA and propose F1 smoothing, a novel label smoothing technique specifically designed for machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks. We evaluate our method on the HotpotQA dataset and demonstrate its superiority over several strong baselines, including models that utilize complex attention mechanisms. Our results suggest that label smoothing can be effective in MHQA, but the choice of smoothing strategy can significantly affect performance. 

### [MIST: Multi-modal Iterative Spatial-Temporal Transformer for Long-form  Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09522)
To build Video Question Answering (VideoQA) systems capable of assisting humans in daily activities, seeking answers from long-form videos with diverse and complex events is a must. Existing multi-modal VQA models achieve promising performance on images or short video clips, especially with the recent success of large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, when extending these methods to long-form videos, new challenges arise. On the one hand, using a dense video sampling strategy is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, methods relying on sparse sampling struggle in scenarios where multi-event and multi-granularity visual reasoning are required. In this work, we introduce a new model named Multi-modal Iterative Spatial-temporal Transformer (MIST) to better adapt pre-trained models for long-form VideoQA. Specifically, MIST decomposes traditional dense spatial-temporal self-attention into cascaded segment and region selection modules that adaptively select frames and image regions that are closely relevant to the question itself. Visual concepts at different granularities are then processed efficiently through an attention module. In addition, MIST iteratively conducts selection and attention over multiple layers to support reasoning over multiple events. The experimental results on four VideoQA datasets, including AGQA, NExT-QA, STAR, and Env-QA, show that MIST achieves state-of-the-art performance and is superior at computation efficiency and interpretability. 

### [Optimizing Prompts for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09611)
Well-designed prompts can guide text-to-image models to generate amazing images. However, the performant prompts are often model-specific and misaligned with user input. Instead of laborious human engineering, we propose prompt adaptation, a general framework that automatically adapts original user input to model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we first perform supervised fine-tuning with a pretrained language model on a small collection of manually engineered prompts. Then we use reinforcement learning to explore better prompts. We define a reward function that encourages the policy to generate more aesthetically pleasing images while preserving the original user intentions. Experimental results on Stable Diffusion show that our method outperforms manual prompt engineering in terms of both automatic metrics and human preference ratings. Moreover, reinforcement learning further boosts performance, especially on out-of-domain prompts. The pretrained checkpoints are available at https://aka.ms/promptist. The demo can be found at https://aka.ms/promptist-demo. 

### [Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Hallucination Detection in Neural  Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09631)
Neural machine translation (NMT) has become the de-facto standard in real-world machine translation applications. However, NMT models can unpredictably produce severely pathological translations, known as hallucinations, that seriously undermine user trust. It becomes thus crucial to implement effective preventive strategies to guarantee their proper functioning. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucination detection in NMT by following a simple intuition: as hallucinations are detached from the source content, they exhibit encoder-decoder attention patterns that are statistically different from those of good quality translations. We frame this problem with an optimal transport formulation and propose a fully unsupervised, plug-in detector that can be used with any attention-based NMT model. Experimental results show that our detector not only outperforms all previous model-based detectors, but is also competitive with detectors that employ large models trained on millions of samples. 

### [Uncovering the Origins of Instability in Dynamical Systems: How  Attention Mechanism Can Help?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09641)
The behavior of the network and its stability are governed by both dynamics of individual nodes as well as their topological interconnections. Attention mechanism as an integral part of neural network models was initially designed for natural language processing (NLP), and so far, has shown excellent performance in combining dynamics of individual nodes and the coupling strengths between them within a network. Despite undoubted impact of attention mechanism, it is not yet clear why some nodes of a network get higher attention weights. To come up with more explainable solutions, we tried to look at the problem from stability perspective. Based on stability theory, negative connections in a network can create feedback loops or other complex structures by allowing information to flow in the opposite direction. These structures play a critical role in the dynamics of a complex system and can contribute to abnormal synchronization, amplification, or suppression. We hypothesized that those nodes that are involved in organizing such structures can push the entire network into instability modes and therefore need higher attention during analysis. To test this hypothesis, attention mechanism along with spectral and topological stability analyses was performed on a real-world numerical problem, i.e., a linear Multi Input Multi Output state-space model of a piezoelectric tube actuator. The findings of our study suggest that the attention should be directed toward the collective behaviour of imbalanced structures and polarity-driven structural instabilities within the network. The results demonstrated that the nodes receiving more attention cause more instability in the system. Our study provides a proof of concept to understand why perturbing some nodes of a network may cause dramatic changes in the network dynamics. 

### [A Retrieve-and-Read Framework for Knowledge Graph Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09724)
Knowledge graph (KG) link prediction aims to infer new facts based on existing facts in the KG. Recent studies have shown that using the graph neighborhood of a node via graph neural networks (GNNs) provides more useful information compared to just using the query information. Conventional GNNs for KG link prediction follow the standard message-passing paradigm on the entire KG, which leads to over-smoothing of representations and also limits their scalability. On a large scale, it becomes computationally expensive to aggregate useful information from the entire KG for inference. To address the limitations of existing KG link prediction frameworks, we propose a novel retrieve-and-read framework, which first retrieves a relevant subgraph context for the query and then jointly reasons over the context and the query with a high-capacity reader. As part of our exemplar instantiation for the new framework, we propose a novel Transformer-based GNN as the reader, which incorporates graph-based attention structure and cross-attention between query and context for deep fusion. This design enables the model to focus on salient context information relevant to the query. Empirical results on two standard KG link prediction datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method. 

### [Correspondence Distillation from NeRF-based GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09735)
The neural radiance field (NeRF) has shown promising results in preserving the fine details of objects and scenes. However, unlike mesh-based representations, it remains an open problem to build dense correspondences across different NeRFs of the same category, which is essential in many downstream tasks. The main difficulties of this problem lie in the implicit nature of NeRF and the lack of ground-truth correspondence annotations. In this paper, we show it is possible to bypass these challenges by leveraging the rich semantics and structural priors encapsulated in a pre-trained NeRF-based GAN. Specifically, we exploit such priors from three aspects, namely 1) a dual deformation field that takes latent codes as global structural indicators, 2) a learning objective that regards generator features as geometric-aware local descriptors, and 3) a source of infinite object-specific NeRF samples. Our experiments demonstrate that such priors lead to 3D dense correspondence that is accurate, smooth, and robust. We also show that established dense correspondence across NeRFs can effectively enable many NeRF-based downstream applications such as texture transfer. 

### [DSI++: Updating Transformer Memory with New Documents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09744)
Differentiable Search Indices (DSIs) encode a corpus of documents in the parameters of a model and use the same model to map queries directly to relevant document identifiers. Despite the strong performance of DSI models, deploying them in situations where the corpus changes over time is computationally expensive because reindexing the corpus requires re-training the model. In this work, we introduce DSI++, a continual learning challenge for DSI to incrementally index new documents while being able to answer queries related to both previously and newly indexed documents. Across different model scales and document identifier representations, we show that continual indexing of new documents leads to considerable forgetting of previously indexed documents. We also hypothesize and verify that the model experiences forgetting events during training, leading to unstable learning. To mitigate these issues, we investigate two approaches. The first focuses on modifying the training dynamics. Flatter minima implicitly alleviate forgetting, so we optimize for flatter loss basins and show that the model stably memorizes more documents (+12\%). Next, we introduce a generative memory to sample pseudo-queries for documents and supplement them during continual indexing to prevent forgetting for the retrieval task. Extensive experiments on novel continual indexing benchmarks based on Natural Questions (NQ) and MS MARCO demonstrate that our proposed solution mitigates forgetting by a significant margin. Concretely, it improves the average Hits@10 by $+21.1\%$ over competitive baselines for NQ and requires $6$ times fewer model updates compared to re-training the DSI model for incrementally indexing five corpora in a sequence. 

### [Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09748)
We explore a new class of diffusion models based on the transformer architecture. We train latent diffusion models of images, replacing the commonly-used U-Net backbone with a transformer that operates on latent patches. We analyze the scalability of our Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of forward pass complexity as measured by Gflops. We find that DiTs with higher Gflops -- through increased transformer depth/width or increased number of input tokens -- consistently have lower FID. In addition to possessing good scalability properties, our largest DiT-XL/2 models outperform all prior diffusion models on the class-conditional ImageNet 512x512 and 256x256 benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 2.27 on the latter. 

### [A novel state connection strategy for quantum computing to represent and  compress digital images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07079)
Quantum image processing draws a lot of attention due to faster data computation and storage compared to classical data processing systems. Converting classical image data into the quantum domain and state label preparation complexity is still a challenging issue. The existing techniques normally connect the pixel values and the state position directly. Recently, the EFRQI (efficient flexible representation of the quantum image) approach uses an auxiliary qubit that connects the pixel-representing qubits to the state position qubits via Toffoli gates to reduce state connection. Due to the twice use of Toffoli gates for each pixel connection still it requires a significant number of bits to connect each pixel value. In this paper, we propose a new SCMFRQI (state connection modification FRQI) approach for further reducing the required bits by modifying the state connection using a reset gate rather than repeating the use of the same Toffoli gate connection as a reset gate. Moreover, unlike other existing methods, we compress images using block-level for further reduction of required qubits. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of both image representation and compression points of view. 

### [Focal-UNet: UNet-like Focal Modulation for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09263)
Recently, many attempts have been made to construct a transformer base U-shaped architecture, and new methods have been proposed that outperformed CNN-based rivals. However, serious problems such as blockiness and cropped edges in predicted masks remain because of transformers' patch partitioning operations. In this work, we propose a new U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation with the help of the newly introduced focal modulation mechanism. The proposed architecture has asymmetric depths for the encoder and decoder. Due to the ability of the focal module to aggregate local and global features, our model could simultaneously benefit the wide receptive field of transformers and local viewing of CNNs. This helps the proposed method balance the local and global feature usage to outperform one of the most powerful transformer-based U-shaped models called Swin-UNet. We achieved a 1.68% higher DICE score and a 0.89 better HD metric on the Synapse dataset. Also, with extremely limited data, we had a 4.25% higher DICE score on the NeoPolyp dataset. Our implementations are available at: https://github.com/givkashi/Focal-UNet 

### [Rank-1 Matrix Completion with Gradient Descent and Small Random  Initialization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09396)
The nonconvex formulation of matrix completion problem has received significant attention in recent years due to its affordable complexity compared to the convex formulation. Gradient descent (GD) is the simplest yet efficient baseline algorithm for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The success of GD has been witnessed in many different problems in both theory and practice when it is combined with random initialization. However, previous works on matrix completion require either careful initialization or regularizers to prove the convergence of GD. In this work, we study the rank-1 symmetric matrix completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random initialization is used. We show that in logarithmic amount of iterations, the trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the convergence and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples are available. We observe that implicit regularization effect of GD plays a critical role in the analysis, and for the entire trajectory, it prevents each entry from becoming much larger than the others.
