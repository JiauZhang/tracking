        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This report provides a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for machine translation, including translation prompt, multilingual translation, and translation robustness. We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its translation ability and find that the candidate prompts generally work well and show minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test sets, we find that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags behind significantly on lowresource or distant languages. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but is potentially a good translator for spoken language.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale pre-trained language models have been shown to be helpful in improving the naturalness of text-to-speech (TTS) models by enabling them to produce more naturalistic prosodic patterns. However, these models are usually word-level or sup-phoneme-level and jointly trained with phonemes, making them inefficient for the downstream TTS task where only phonemes are needed. In this work, we propose a phoneme-level BERT (PL-BERT) with a pretext task of predicting the corresponding graphemes along with the regular masked phoneme predictions. Subjective evaluations show that our phoneme-level BERT encoder has significantly improved the mean opinion scores (MOS) of rated naturalness of synthesized speech compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) StyleTTS baseline on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Current child face generators are restricted by the limited size of the available datasets. In addition, feature selection can prove to be a significant challenge, especially due to the large amount of features that need to be trained for. To manage these problems, we proposed CADA-GAN, a \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware GAN that allows optimal feature extraction, with added robustness from additional \textbf{D}ata \textbf{A}ugmentation. CADA-GAN is adapted from the popular StyleGAN2-Ada model, with attention on augmentation and segmentation of the parent images. The model has the lowest \textit{Mean Squared Error Loss} (MSEloss) on latent feature representations and the generated child image is robust compared with the one that generated from baseline models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multivariate Time Series forecasting has been an increasingly popular topic in various applications and scenarios. Recently, contrastive learning and Transformer-based models have achieved good performance in many long-term series forecasting tasks. However, there are still several issues in existing methods. First, the training paradigm of contrastive learning and downstream prediction tasks are inconsistent, leading to inaccurate prediction results. Second, existing Transformer-based models which resort to similar patterns in historical time series data for predicting future values generally induce severe distribution shift problems, and do not fully leverage the sequence information compared to self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Ti-MAE, in which the input time series are assumed to follow an integrate distribution. In detail, Ti-MAE randomly masks out embedded time series data and learns an autoencoder to reconstruct them at the point-level. Ti-MAE adopts mask modeling (rather than contrastive learning) as the auxiliary task and bridges the connection between existing representation learning and generative Transformer-based methods, reducing the difference between upstream and downstream forecasting tasks while maintaining the utilization of original time series data. Experiments on several public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework of masked autoencoding could learn strong representations directly from the raw data, yielding better performance in time series forecasting and classification tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: On-site estimation of sea state parameters is crucial for ship navigation systems' accuracy, stability, and efficiency. Extensive research has been conducted on model-based estimating methods utilizing only ship motion responses. Model-free approaches based on machine learning (ML) have recently gained popularity, and estimation from time-series of ship motion responses using deep learning (DL) methods has given promising results. Accordingly, in this study, we apply the novel, attention-based neural network (AT-NN) for estimating sea state parameters (wave height, zero-crossing period, and relative wave direction) from raw time-series data of ship pitch, heave, and roll motions. Despite using reduced input data, it has been successfully demonstrated that the proposed approaches by modified state-of-the-art techniques (based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for regression, multivariate long short-term memory CNN, and sliding puzzle neural network) reduced estimation MSE by 23% and MAE by 16% compared to the original methods. Furthermore, the proposed technique based on AT-NN outperformed all tested methods (original and enhanced), reducing estimation MSE by up to 94% and MAE by up to 70%. Finally, we also proposed a novel approach for interpreting the uncertainty estimation of neural network outputs based on the Monte-Carlo dropout method to enhance the model's trustworthiness. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: When perceiving the world from multiple viewpoints, humans have the ability to reason about the complete objects in a compositional manner even when the object is completely occluded from partial viewpoints. Meanwhile, humans can imagine the novel views after observing multiple viewpoints. The remarkable recent advance in multi-view object-centric learning leaves some problems: 1) the partially or completely occluded shape of objects can not be well reconstructed. 2) the novel viewpoint prediction depends on expensive viewpoint annotations rather than implicit view rules. This makes the agent fail to perform like humans. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative model for videos. To reconstruct the complete shape of the object accurately, we enhance the disentanglement between different latent representations: view latent representations are jointly inferred based on the Transformer and then cooperate with the sequential extension of Slot Attention to learn object-centric representations. The model also achieves the new ability: Gaussian processes are employed as priors of view latent variables for generation and novel-view prediction without viewpoint annotations. Experiments on multiple specifically designed synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed model can 1) make the video decomposition, 2) reconstruct the complete shapes of objects, and 3) make the novel viewpoint prediction without viewpoint annotations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Precise localization is critical for autonomous vehicles. We present a self-supervised learning method that employs Transformers for the first time for the task of outdoor localization using LiDAR data. We propose a pre-text task that reorganizes the slices of a $360^\circ$ LiDAR scan to leverage its axial properties. Our model, called Slice Transformer, employs multi-head attention while systematically processing the slices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of leveraging multi-head attention for outdoor point clouds. We additionally introduce the Perth-WA dataset, which provides a large-scale LiDAR map of Perth city in Western Australia, covering $\sim$4km$^2$ area. Localization annotations are provided for Perth-WA. The proposed localization method is thoroughly evaluated on Perth-WA and Appollo-SouthBay datasets. We also establish the efficacy of our self-supervised learning approach for the common downstream task of object classification using ModelNet40 and ScanNN datasets. The code and Perth-WA data will be publicly released. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the growing model size, deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly trained over massive GPU accelerators, which demands a proper parallelization plan that transforms a DNN model into fine-grained tasks and then schedules them to GPUs for execution. Due to the large search space, the contemporary parallelization plan generators often rely on empirical rules that couple transformation and scheduling, and fall short in exploring more flexible schedules that yield better memory usage and compute efficiency. This tension can be exacerbated by the emerging models with increasing complexity in their structure and model size. SuperScaler is a system that facilitates the design and generation of highly flexible parallelization plans. It formulates the plan design and generation into three sequential phases explicitly: model transformation, space-time scheduling, and data dependency preserving. Such a principled approach decouples multiple seemingly intertwined factors and enables the composition of highly flexible parallelization plans. As a result, SuperScaler can not only generate empirical parallelization plans, but also construct new plans that achieve up to 3.5X speedup compared to state-of-the-art solutions like DeepSpeed, Megatron and Alpa, for emerging DNN models like Swin-Transformer and AlphaFold2, as well as well-optimized models like GPT-3. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Technological advancements in web platforms allow people to express and share emotions towards textual write-ups written and shared by others. This brings about different interesting domains for analysis; emotion expressed by the writer and emotion elicited from the readers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for Readers' Emotion Detection from short-text documents using a deep learning model called REDAffectiveLM. Within state-of-the-art NLP tasks, it is well understood that utilizing context-specific representations from transformer-based pre-trained language models helps achieve improved performance. Within this affective computing task, we explore how incorporating affective information can further enhance performance. Towards this, we leverage context-specific and affect enriched representations by using a transformer-based pre-trained language model in tandem with affect enriched Bi-LSTM+Attention. For empirical evaluation, we procure a new dataset REN-20k, besides using RENh-4k and SemEval-2007. We evaluate the performance of our REDAffectiveLM rigorously across these datasets, against a vast set of state-of-the-art baselines, where our model consistently outperforms baselines and obtains statistically significant results. Our results establish that utilizing affect enriched representation along with context-specific representation within a neural architecture can considerably enhance readers' emotion detection. Since the impact of affect enrichment specifically in readers' emotion detection isn't well explored, we conduct a detailed analysis over affect enriched Bi-LSTM+Attention using qualitative and quantitative model behavior evaluation techniques. We observe that compared to conventional semantic embedding, affect enriched embedding increases ability of the network to effectively identify and assign weightage to key terms responsible for readers' emotion detection. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Past work probing compositionality in sentence embedding models faces issues determining the causal impact of implicit syntax representations. Given a sentence, we construct a neural module net based on its syntax parse and train it end-to-end to approximate the sentence's embedding generated by a transformer model. The distillability of a transformer to a Syntactic NeurAl Module Net (SynNaMoN) then captures whether syntax is a strong causal model of its compositional ability. Furthermore, we address questions about the geometry of semantic composition by specifying individual SynNaMoN modules' internal architecture &amp; linearity. We find differences in the distillability of various sentence embedding models that broadly correlate with their performance, but observe that distillability doesn't considerably vary by model size. We also present preliminary evidence that much syntax-guided composition in sentence embedding models is linear, and that non-linearities may serve primarily to handle non-compositional phrases. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Groundbreaking inventions and highly significant performance improvements in deep learning based Natural Language Processing are witnessed through the development of transformer based large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The wide availability of unlabeled data within human generated data deluge along with self-supervised learning strategy helps to accelerate the success of large PLMs in language generation, language understanding, etc. But at the same time, latent historical bias/unfairness in human minds towards a particular gender, race, etc., encoded unintentionally/intentionally into the corpora harms and questions the utility and efficacy of large PLMs in many real-world applications, particularly for the protected groups. In this paper, we present an extensive investigation towards understanding the existence of "Affective Bias" in large PLMs to unveil any biased association of emotions such as anger, fear, joy, etc., towards a particular gender, race or religion with respect to the downstream task of textual emotion detection. We conduct our exploration of affective bias from the very initial stage of corpus level affective bias analysis by searching for imbalanced distribution of affective words within a domain, in large scale corpora that are used to pre-train and fine-tune PLMs. Later, to quantify affective bias in model predictions, we perform an extensive set of class-based and intensity-based evaluations using various bias evaluation corpora. Our results show the existence of statistically significant affective bias in the PLM based emotion detection systems, indicating biased association of certain emotions towards a particular gender, race, and religion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The proliferation of non-cooperative resident space objects (RSOs) in orbit has spurred the demand for active space debris removal, on-orbit servicing (OOS), classification, and functionality identification of these RSOs. Recent advances in computer vision have enabled high-definition 3D modeling of objects based on a set of 2D images captured from different viewing angles. This work adapts Instant NeRF and D-NeRF, variations of the neural radiance field (NeRF) algorithm to the problem of mapping RSOs in orbit for the purposes of functionality identification and assisting with OOS. The algorithms are evaluated for 3D reconstruction quality and hardware requirements using datasets of images of a spacecraft mock-up taken under two different lighting and motion conditions at the Orbital Robotic Interaction, On-Orbit Servicing and Navigation (ORION) Laboratory at Florida Institute of Technology. Instant NeRF is shown to learn high-fidelity 3D models with a computational cost that could feasibly be trained on on-board computers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Tracking tasks based on deep neural networks have greatly improved with the emergence of Siamese trackers. However, the appearance of targets often changes during tracking, which can reduce the robustness of the tracker when facing challenges such as aspect ratio change, occlusion, and scale variation. In addition, cluttered backgrounds can lead to multiple high response points in the response map, leading to incorrect target positioning. In this paper, we introduce two transformer-based modules to improve Siamese tracking called DASTSiam: the spatio-temporal (ST) fusion module and the Discriminative Augmentation (DA) module. The ST module uses cross-attention based accumulation of historical cues to improve robustness against object appearance changes, while the DA module associates semantic information between the template and search region to improve target discrimination. Moreover, Modifying the label assignment of anchors also improves the reliability of the object location. Our modules can be used with all Siamese trackers and show improved performance on several public datasets through comparative and ablation experiments. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Adversarial training (AT) is widely considered as the most promising strategy to defend against adversarial attacks and has drawn increasing interest from researchers. However, the existing AT methods still suffer from two challenges. First, they are unable to handle unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs), which are built from scratch, as opposed to restricted adversarial examples (RAEs), which are created by adding perturbations bound by an $l_p$ norm to observed examples. Second, the existing AT methods often achieve adversarial robustness at the expense of standard generalizability (i.e., the accuracy on natural examples) because they make a tradeoff between them. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unique viewpoint that understands UAEs as imperceptibly perturbed unobserved examples. Also, we find that the tradeoff results from the separation of the distributions of adversarial examples and natural examples. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel AT approach called Provable Unrestricted Adversarial Training (PUAT), which can provide a target classifier with comprehensive adversarial robustness against both UAE and RAE, and simultaneously improve its standard generalizability. Particularly, PUAT utilizes partially labeled data to achieve effective UAE generation by accurately capturing the natural data distribution through a novel augmented triple-GAN. At the same time, PUAT extends the traditional AT by introducing the supervised loss of the target classifier into the adversarial loss and achieves the alignment between the UAE distribution, the natural data distribution, and the distribution learned by the classifier, with the collaboration of the augmented triple-GAN. Finally, the solid theoretical analysis and extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PUAT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Dance-driven music generation aims to generate musical pieces conditioned on dance videos. Previous works focus on monophonic or raw audio generation, while the multiinstruments scenario is under-explored. The challenges of the dance-driven multi-instruments music (MIDI) generation are two-fold: 1) no publicly available multi-instruments MIDI and video paired dataset and 2) the weak correlation between music and video. To tackle these challenges, we build the first multi-instruments MIDI and dance paired dataset (D2MIDI). Based on our proposed dataset, we introduce a multi-instruments MIDI generation framework (Dance2MIDI) conditioned on dance video. Specifically, 1) to model the correlation between music and dance, we encode the dance motion using the GCN, and 2) to generate harmonious and coherent music, we employ Transformer to decode the MIDI sequence. We evaluate the generated music of our framework trained on D2MIDI dataset and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D-aware GANs aim to synthesize realistic 3D scenes such that they can be rendered in arbitrary perspectives to produce images. Although previous methods produce realistic images, they suffer from unstable training or degenerate solutions where the 3D geometry is unnatural. We hypothesize that the 3D geometry is underdetermined due to the insufficient constraint, i.e., being classified as real image to the discriminator is not enough. To solve this problem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and represent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the thin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background field. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate dedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN. BallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D geometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better photometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The training becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered on top of different arbitrary backgrounds. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: To tackle the global climate challenge, it urgently needs to develop a collaborative platform for comprehensive weather forecasting on large-scale meteorological data. Despite urgency, heterogeneous meteorological sensors across countries and regions, inevitably causing multivariate heterogeneity and data exposure, become the main barrier. This paper develops a foundation model across regions capable of understanding complex meteorological data and providing weather forecasting. To relieve the data exposure concern across regions, a novel federated learning approach has been proposed to collaboratively learn a brand-new spatio-temporal Transformer-based foundation model across participants with heterogeneous meteorological data. Moreover, a novel prompt learning mechanism has been adopted to satisfy low-resourced sensors' communication and computational constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated on classical weather forecasting tasks using three meteorological datasets with multivariate time series. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image recognition and quality assessment are two important viewing tasks, while potentially following different visual mechanisms. This paper investigates if the two tasks can be performed in a multitask learning manner. A sequential spatial-channel attention module is proposed to simulate the visual attention and contrast sensitivity mechanisms that are crucial for content recognition and quality assessment. Spatial attention is shared between content recognition and quality assessment, while channel attention is solely for quality assessment. Such attention module is integrated into Transformer to build a uniform model for the two viewing tasks. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed uniform model can achieve promising performance for both quality assessment and content recognition tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study the task of object interaction anticipation in egocentric videos. Successful prediction of future actions and objects requires an understanding of the spatio-temporal context formed by past actions and object relationships. We propose TransFusion, a multimodal transformer-based architecture, that effectively makes use of the representational power of language by summarizing past actions concisely. TransFusion leverages pre-trained image captioning models and summarizes the caption, focusing on past actions and objects. This action context together with a single input frame is processed by a multimodal fusion module to forecast the next object interactions. Our model enables more efficient end-to-end learning by replacing dense video features with language representations, allowing us to benefit from knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models. Experiments on Ego4D and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 show the effectiveness of our multimodal fusion model and the benefits of using language-based context summaries. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 40.4% in overall mAP on the Ego4D test set. We show the generality of TransFusion via experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Bidirectional Transformer architectures are state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models that use a bi-directional representation capacity based on the Cloze task, a.k.a. Masked Language Modeling. The latter aims to predict randomly masked items within the sequence. Because they assume that the true interacted item is the most relevant one, an exposure bias results, where non-interacted items with low exposure propensities are assumed to be irrelevant. The most common approach to mitigating exposure bias in recommendation has been Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), which consists of down-weighting the interacted predictions in the loss function in proportion to their propensities of exposure, yielding a theoretically unbiased learning. In this work, we argue and prove that IPS does not extend to sequential recommendation because it fails to account for the temporal nature of the problem. We then propose a novel propensity scoring mechanism, which can theoretically debias the Cloze task in sequential recommendation. Finally we empirically demonstrate the debiasing capabilities of our proposed approach and its robustness to the severity of exposure bias. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Accordingly, we propose the combined use of federated learning (FL) and encrypted images for privacy-preserving image classification under the use of the vision transformer (ViT). The proposed method allows us not only to train models over multiple participants without directly sharing their raw data but to also protect the privacy of test (query) images for the first time. In addition, it can also maintain the same accuracy as normally trained models. In an experiment, the proposed method was demonstrated to well work without any performance degradation on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers gain popularity because of their superior prediction accuracy and inference throughput. However, the transformer is computation-intensive, causing a long inference time. The existing work to accelerate transformer inferences has limitations because of the changes to transformer architectures or the need for specialized hardware. In this paper, we identify the opportunities of using memoization to accelerate the attention mechanism in transformers without the above limitation. Built upon a unique observation that there is a rich similarity in attention computation across inference sequences, we build an attention database upon the emerging big memory system. We introduce the embedding technique to find semantically similar inputs to identify computation similarity. We also introduce a series of techniques such as memory mapping and selective memoization to avoid memory copy and unnecessary overhead. We enable 21% performance improvement on average (up to 68%) with the TB-scale attention database and with ignorable loss in inference accuracy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, three efficient ensemble algorithms are proposed for fast-solving the random fluid-fluid interaction model. Such a model can be simplified as coupling two heat equations with random diffusion coefficients and a friction parameter due to its complexity and uncertainty. We utilize the Monte Carlo method for the coupled model with random inputs to derive some deterministic fluid-fluid numerical models and use the ensemble idea to realize the fast computation of multiple problems. Our remarkable feature of these algorithms is employing the same coefficient matrix for multiple linear systems, significantly reducing the computational cost. By data-passing partitioned techniques, we can decouple the numerical models into two smaller sub-domain problems and achieve parallel computation. Theoretically, we derive that both algorithms are unconditionally stable and convergent. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted not only to support the theoretical results but also to validate the exclusive feature of the proposed algorithms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Mental health counseling remains a major challenge in modern society due to cost, stigma, fear, and unavailability. We posit that generative artificial intelligence (AI) models designed for mental health counseling could help improve outcomes by lowering barriers to access. To this end, we have developed a deep learning (DL) dialogue system called Serena. The system consists of a core generative model and post-processing algorithms. The core generative model is a 2.7 billion parameter Seq2Seq Transformer fine-tuned on thousands of transcripts of person-centered-therapy (PCT) sessions. The series of post-processing algorithms detects contradictions, improves coherency, and removes repetitive answers. Serena is implemented and deployed on \url{https://serena.chat}, which currently offers limited free services. While the dialogue system is capable of responding in a qualitatively empathetic and engaging manner, occasionally it displays hallucination and long-term incoherence. Overall, we demonstrate that a deep learning mental health dialogue system has the potential to provide a low-cost and effective complement to traditional human counselors with less barriers to access. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most existing transformer based video instance segmentation methods extract per frame features independently, hence it is challenging to solve the appearance deformation problem. In this paper, we observe the temporal information is important as well and we propose TAFormer to aggregate spatio-temporal features both in transformer encoder and decoder. Specifically, in transformer encoder, we propose a novel spatio-temporal joint multi-scale deformable attention module which dynamically integrates the spatial and temporal information to obtain enriched spatio-temporal features. In transformer decoder, we introduce a temporal self-attention module to enhance the frame level box queries with the temporal relation. Moreover, TAFormer adopts an instance level contrastive loss to increase the discriminability of instance query embeddings. Therefore the tracking error caused by visually similar instances can be decreased. Experimental results show that TAFormer effectively leverages the spatial and temporal information to obtain context-aware feature representation and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we quantify the impact of using non-convergent Markov chains to train Energy-Based models (EBMs). In particular, we show analytically that EBMs trained with non-persistent short runs to estimate the gradient can perfectly reproduce a set of empirical statistics of the data, not at the level of the equilibrium measure, but through a precise dynamical process. Our results provide a first-principles explanation for the observations of recent works proposing the strategy of using short runs starting from random initial conditions as an efficient way to generate high-quality samples in EBMs, and lay the groundwork for using EBMs as diffusion models. After explaining this effect in generic EBMs, we analyze two solvable models in which the effect of the non-convergent sampling in the trained parameters can be described in detail. Finally, we test these predictions numerically on the Boltzmann machine. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: What will happen when unsupervised learning meets diffusion models for real-world image deraining? To answer it, we propose RainDiffusion, the first unsupervised image deraining paradigm based on diffusion models. Beyond the traditional unsupervised wisdom of image deraining, RainDiffusion introduces stable training of unpaired real-world data instead of weakly adversarial training. RainDiffusion consists of two cooperative branches: Non-diffusive Translation Branch (NTB) and Diffusive Translation Branch (DTB). NTB exploits a cycle-consistent architecture to bypass the difficulty in unpaired training of standard diffusion models by generating initial clean/rainy image pairs. DTB leverages two conditional diffusion modules to progressively refine the desired output with initial image pairs and diffusive generative prior, to obtain a better generalization ability of deraining and rain generation. Rain-Diffusion is a non adversarial training paradigm, serving as a new standard bar for real-world image deraining. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our RainDiffusion over un/semi-supervised methods and show its competitive advantages over fully-supervised ones. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study and develop multilevel methods for the numerical approximation of a log-concave probability $\pi$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, based on (over-damped) Langevin diffusion. In the continuity of \cite{art:egeapanloup2021multilevel} concentrated on the uniformly log-concave setting, we here study the procedure in the absence of the uniformity assumption. More precisely, we first adapt an idea of \cite{art:DalalyanRiouKaragulyan} by adding a penalization term to the potential to recover the uniformly convex setting. Such approach leads to an \textit{$\varepsilon$-complexity} of the order $\varepsilon^{-5} \pi(|.|^2)^{3} d$ (up to logarithmic terms). Then, in the spirit of \cite{art:gadat2020cost}, we propose to explore the robustness of the method in a weakly convex parametric setting where the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian of the potential $U$ is controlled by the function $U(x)^{-r}$ for $r \in (0,1)$. In this intermediary framework between the strongly convex setting ($r=0$) and the ``Laplace case'' ($r=1$), we show that with the help of the control of exponential moments of the Euler scheme, we can adapt some fundamental properties for the efficiency of the method. In the ``best'' setting where $U$ is ${\mathcal{C}}^3$ and $U(x)^{-r}$ control the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, we obtain an $\varepsilon$-complexity of the order $c_{\rho,\delta}\varepsilon^{-2-\rho} d^{1+\frac{\rho}{2}+(4-\rho+\delta) r}$ for any $\rho&gt;0$ (but with a constant $c_{\rho,\delta}$ which increases when $\rho$ and $\delta$ go to $0$). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-world data generation often involves complex inter-dependencies among instances, violating the IID-data hypothesis of standard learning paradigms and posing a challenge for uncovering the geometric structures for learning desired instance representations. To this end, we introduce an energy constrained diffusion model which encodes a batch of instances from a dataset into evolutionary states that progressively incorporate other instances' information by their interactions. The diffusion process is constrained by descent criteria w.r.t.~a principled energy function that characterizes the global consistency of instance representations over latent structures. We provide rigorous theory that implies closed-form optimal estimates for the pairwise diffusion strength among arbitrary instance pairs, which gives rise to a new class of neural encoders, dubbed as DIFFormer (diffusion-based Transformers), with two instantiations: a simple version with linear complexity for prohibitive instance numbers, and an advanced version for learning complex structures. Experiments highlight the wide applicability of our model as a general-purpose encoder backbone with superior performance in various tasks, such as node classification on large graphs, semi-supervised image/text classification, and spatial-temporal dynamics prediction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a central topic in learning graph-structured data. While numerous approaches have been proposed to improve GNNs in terms of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, generally there is still a lack of deep understanding of what additional power they can systematically and provably gain. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different perspective to study the expressive power of GNNs beyond the WL test. Specifically, we introduce a novel class of expressivity metrics via graph biconnectivity and highlight their importance in both theory and practice. As biconnectivity can be easily calculated using simple algorithms that have linear computational costs, it is natural to expect that popular GNNs can learn it easily as well. However, after a thorough review of prior GNN architectures, we surprisingly find that most of them are not expressive for any of these metrics. The only exception is the ESAN framework (Bevilacqua et al., 2022), for which we give a theoretical justification of its power. We proceed to introduce a principled and more efficient approach, called the Generalized Distance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL), which is provably expressive for all biconnectivity metrics. Practically, we show GD-WL can be implemented by a Transformer-like architecture that preserves expressiveness and enjoys full parallelizability. A set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach can consistently outperform prior GNN architectures. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously detecting objects and inferring their visual attributes in an image, even for those with no manual annotations provided at the training stage, resembling an open-vocabulary scenario. To achieve this goal, we make the following contributions: (i) we start with a naive two-stage approach for open-vocabulary object detection and attribute classification, termed CLIP-Attr. The candidate objects are first proposed with an offline RPN and later classified for semantic category and attributes; (ii) we combine all available datasets and train with a federated strategy to finetune the CLIP model, aligning the visual representation with attributes, additionally, we investigate the efficacy of leveraging freely available online image-caption pairs under weakly supervised learning; (iii) in pursuit of efficiency, we train a Faster-RCNN type model end-to-end with knowledge distillation, that performs class-agnostic object proposals and classification on semantic categories and attributes with classifiers generated from a text encoder; Finally, (iv) we conduct extensive experiments on VAW, MS-COCO, LSA, and OVAD datasets, and show that recognition of semantic category and attributes is complementary for visual scene understanding, i.e., jointly training object detection and attributes prediction largely outperform existing approaches that treat the two tasks independently, demonstrating strong generalization ability to novel attributes and categories. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-to-image synthesis has recently seen significant progress thanks to large pretrained language models, large-scale training data, and the introduction of scalable model families such as diffusion and autoregressive models. However, the best-performing models require iterative evaluation to generate a single sample. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) only need a single forward pass. They are thus much faster, but they currently remain far behind the state-of-the-art in large-scale text-to-image synthesis. This paper aims to identify the necessary steps to regain competitiveness. Our proposed model, StyleGAN-T, addresses the specific requirements of large-scale text-to-image synthesis, such as large capacity, stable training on diverse datasets, strong text alignment, and controllable variation vs. text alignment tradeoff. StyleGAN-T significantly improves over previous GANs and outperforms distilled diffusion models - the previous state-of-the-art in fast text-to-image synthesis - in terms of sample quality and speed. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Active perception describes a broad class of techniques that couple planning and perception systems to move the robot in a way to give the robot more information about the environment. In most robotic systems, perception is typically independent of motion planning. For example, traditional object detection is passive: it operates only on the images it receives. However, we have a chance to improve the results if we allow planning to consume detection signals and move the robot to collect views that maximize the quality of the results. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning (RL) methods to control the robot in order to obtain images that maximize the detection quality. Specifically, we propose using a Decision Transformer with online fine-tuning, which first optimizes the policy with a pre-collected expert dataset and then improves the learned policy by exploring better solutions in the environment. We evaluate the performance of proposed method on an interactive dataset collected from an indoor scenario simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including expert policy and pure offline RL methods. We also provide exhaustive analyses of the reward distribution and observation space. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Attention-based models are appealing for multimodal processing because inputs from multiple modalities can be concatenated and fed to a single backbone network - thus requiring very little fusion engineering. The resulting representations are however fully entangled throughout the network, which may not always be desirable: in learning, contrastive audio-visual self-supervised learning requires independent audio and visual features to operate, otherwise learning collapses; in inference, evaluation of audio-visual models should be possible on benchmarks having just audio or just video. In this paper, we introduce Zorro, a technique that uses masks to control how inputs from each modality are routed inside Transformers, keeping some parts of the representation modality-pure. We apply this technique to three popular transformer-based architectures (ViT, Swin and HiP) and show that with contrastive pre-training Zorro achieves state-of-the-art results on most relevant benchmarks for multimodal tasks (AudioSet and VGGSound). Furthermore, the resulting models are able to perform unimodal inference on both video and audio benchmarks such as Kinetics-400 or ESC-50. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Background: Deep learning (DL) can extract predictive and prognostic biomarkers from routine pathology slides in colorectal cancer. For example, a DL test for the diagnosis of microsatellite instability (MSI) in CRC has been approved in 2022. Current approaches rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Transformer networks are outperforming CNNs and are replacing them in many applications, but have not been used for biomarker prediction in cancer at a large scale. In addition, most DL approaches have been trained on small patient cohorts, which limits their clinical utility. Methods: In this study, we developed a new fully transformer-based pipeline for end-to-end biomarker prediction from pathology slides. We combine a pre-trained transformer encoder and a transformer network for patch aggregation, capable of yielding single and multi-target prediction at patient level. We train our pipeline on over 9,000 patients from 10 colorectal cancer cohorts. Results: A fully transformer-based approach massively improves the performance, generalizability, data efficiency, and interpretability as compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms. After training on a large multicenter cohort, we achieve a sensitivity of 0.97 with a negative predictive value of 0.99 for MSI prediction on surgical resection specimens. We demonstrate for the first time that resection specimen-only training reaches clinical-grade performance on endoscopic biopsy tissue, solving a long-standing diagnostic problem. Interpretation: A fully transformer-based end-to-end pipeline trained on thousands of pathology slides yields clinical-grade performance for biomarker prediction on surgical resections and biopsies.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most Transformer language models are primarily pretrained on English text, limiting their use for other languages. As the model sizes grow, the performance gap between English and other languages with fewer compute and data resources increases even further. Consequently, more resource-efficient training methods are needed to bridge the gap for languages with fewer resources available. To address this problem, we introduce a cross-lingual and progressive transfer learning approach, called CLP-Transfer, that transfers models from a source language, for which pretrained models are publicly available, like English, to a new target language. As opposed to prior work, which focused on the cross-lingual transfer between two languages, we extend the transfer to the model size. Given a pretrained model in a source language, we aim for a same-sized model in a target language. Instead of training a model from scratch, we exploit a smaller model that is in the target language but requires much fewer resources. Both small and source models are then used to initialize the token embeddings of the larger model based on the overlapping vocabulary of the source and target language. All remaining weights are reused from the model in the source language. This approach outperforms the sole cross-lingual transfer and can save up to 80% of the training steps compared to the random initialization. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Humans universally dislike the task of cleaning up a messy room. If machines were to help us with this task, they must understand human criteria for regular arrangements, such as several types of symmetry, co-linearity or co-circularity, spacing uniformity in linear or circular patterns, and further inter-object relationships that relate to style and functionality. Previous approaches for this task relied on human input to explicitly specify goal state, or synthesized scenes from scratch -- but such methods do not address the rearrangement of existing messy scenes without providing a goal state. In this paper, we present LEGO-Net, a data-driven transformer-based iterative method for learning regular rearrangement of objects in messy rooms. LEGO-Net is partly inspired by diffusion models -- it starts with an initial messy state and iteratively "de-noises'' the position and orientation of objects to a regular state while reducing the distance traveled. Given randomly perturbed object positions and orientations in an existing dataset of professionally-arranged scenes, our method is trained to recover a regular re-arrangement. Results demonstrate that our method is able to reliably rearrange room scenes and outperform other methods. We additionally propose a metric for evaluating regularity in room arrangements using number-theoretic machinery. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Modeling and re-rendering dynamic 3D scenes is a challenging task in 3D vision. Prior approaches build on NeRF and rely on implicit representations. This is slow since it requires many MLP evaluations, constraining real-world applications. We show that dynamic 3D scenes can be explicitly represented by six planes of learned features, leading to an elegant solution we call HexPlane. A HexPlane computes features for points in spacetime by fusing vectors extracted from each plane, which is highly efficient. Pairing a HexPlane with a tiny MLP to regress output colors and training via volume rendering gives impressive results for novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes, matching the image quality of prior work but reducing training time by more than $100\times$. Extensive ablations confirm our HexPlane design and show that it is robust to different feature fusion mechanisms, coordinate systems, and decoding mechanisms. HexPlanes are a simple and effective solution for representing 4D volumes, and we hope they can broadly contribute to modeling spacetime for dynamic 3D scenes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Inference problems for two-dimensional snapshots of rotating turbulent flows are studied. We perform a systematic quantitative benchmark of point-wise and statistical reconstruction capabilities of the linear Extended Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (EPOD) method, a non-linear Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We attack the important task of inferring one velocity component out of the measurement of a second one, and two cases are studied: (I) both components lay in the plane orthogonal to the rotation axis and (II) one of the two is parallel to the rotation axis. We show that EPOD method works well only for the former case where both components are strongly correlated, while CNN and GAN always outperform EPOD both concerning point-wise and statistical reconstructions. For case (II), when the input and output data are weakly correlated, all methods fail to reconstruct faithfully the point-wise information. In this case, only GAN is able to reconstruct the field in a statistical sense. The analysis is performed using both standard validation tools based on L2 spatial distance between the prediction and the ground truth and more sophisticated multi-scale analysis using wavelet decomposition. Statistical validation is based on standard Jensen-Shannon divergence between the probability density functions, spectral properties and multi-scale flatness. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a widely used modality for early lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Features extracted from CT images are now accepted to quantify spatial and temporal variations in tumor architecture and function. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition standards, resulting in significantly different texture features even for the same patient, posing a fundamental challenge to downstream studies. Existing CT image harmonization models rely on supervised or semi-supervised techniques, with limited performance. In this paper, we have proposed a diffusion-based CT image standardization model called DiffusionCT which works on latent space by mapping latent distribution into a standard distribution. DiffusionCT incorporates an Unet-based encoder-decoder and a diffusion model embedded in its bottleneck part. The Unet first trained without the diffusion model to learn the latent representation of the input data. The diffusion model is trained in the next training phase. All the trained models work together on image standardization. The encoded representation outputted from the Unet encoder passes through the diffusion model, and the diffusion model maps the distribution in to target standard image domain. Finally, the decode takes that transformed latent representation to synthesize a standardized image. The experimental results show that DiffusionCT significantly improves the performance of the standardization task. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
