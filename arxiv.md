        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\textbf{Lion}$ ($\textit{Evo$\textbf{L}$ved S$\textbf{i}$gn M$\textbf{o}$me$\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. The implementation of Lion is publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) has gained an increased amount of attention in the general research community over the last years as an example of a typical limited data application - with experiments on labeled 100k-200k datasets. Although these datasets are still small compared to natural image datasets like ImageNet1k, ImageNet21k and JFT, they are large for annotated medical datasets, where 1k-10k labeled samples are much more common. There is no baseline on which methods to build on in the low data regime. In this work we bridge this gap by providing an extensive study on medical image classification with limited annotations (5k). We present a study of modern architectures applied to a fixed low data regime of 5000 images on the CheXpert dataset. Conclusively we find that models pretrained on ImageNet21k achieve a higher AUC and larger models require less training steps. All models are quite well calibrated even though we only fine-tuned on 5000 training samples. All 'modern' architectures have higher AUC than ResNet50. Regularization of Big Transfer Models with MixUp or Mean Teacher improves calibration, MixUp also improves accuracy. Vision Transformer achieve comparable or on par results to Big Transfer Models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce STREET, a unified multi-task and multi-domain natural language reasoning and explanation benchmark. Unlike most existing question-answering (QA) datasets, we expect models to not only answer questions, but also produce step-by-step structured explanations describing how premises in the question are used to produce intermediate conclusions that can prove the correctness of a certain answer. We perform extensive evaluation with popular language models such as few-shot prompting GPT-3 and fine-tuned T5. We find that these models still lag behind human performance when producing such structured reasoning steps. We believe this work will provide a way for the community to better train and test systems on multi-step reasoning and explanations in natural language. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: GAN-based image restoration inverts the generative process to repair images corrupted by known degradations. Existing unsupervised methods must be carefully tuned for each task and degradation level. In this work, we make StyleGAN image restoration robust: a single set of hyperparameters works across a wide range of degradation levels. This makes it possible to handle combinations of several degradations, without the need to retune. Our proposed approach relies on a 3-phase progressive latent space extension and a conservative optimizer, which avoids the need for any additional regularization terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate robustness on inpainting, upsampling, denoising, and deartifacting at varying degradations levels, outperforming other StyleGAN-based inversion techniques. Our approach also favorably compares to diffusion-based restoration by yielding much more realistic inversion results. Code will be released upon publication. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image-based fashion design with AI techniques has attracted increasing attention in recent years. We focus on a new fashion design task, where we aim to transfer a reference appearance image onto a clothing image while preserving the structure of the clothing image. It is a challenging task since there are no reference images available for the newly designed output fashion images. Although diffusion-based image translation or neural style transfer (NST) has enabled flexible style transfer, it is often difficult to maintain the original structure of the image realistically during the reverse diffusion, especially when the referenced appearance image greatly differs from the common clothing appearance. To tackle this issue, we present a novel diffusion model-based unsupervised structure-aware transfer method to semantically generate new clothes from a given clothing image and a reference appearance image. In specific, we decouple the foreground clothing with automatically generated semantic masks by conditioned labels. And the mask is further used as guidance in the denoising process to preserve the structure information. Moreover, we use the pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) for both appearance and structure guidance. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, generating more realistic images in the fashion design task.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent work has shown the possibility of training generative models of 3D content from 2D image collections on small datasets corresponding to a single object class, such as human faces, animal faces, or cars. However, these models struggle on larger, more complex datasets. To model diverse and unconstrained image collections such as ImageNet, we present VQ3D, which introduces a NeRF-based decoder into a two-stage vector-quantized autoencoder. Our Stage 1 allows for the reconstruction of an input image and the ability to change the camera position around the image, and our Stage 2 allows for the generation of new 3D scenes. VQ3D is capable of generating and reconstructing 3D-aware images from the 1000-class ImageNet dataset of 1.2 million training images. We achieve an ImageNet generation FID score of 16.8, compared to 69.8 for the next best baseline method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are quickly advancing AI to the frontiers of practical consumer use and leading industries to re-evaluate how they allocate resources for content production. Authoring of open educational resources and hint content within adaptive tutoring systems is labor intensive. Should LLMs like ChatGPT produce educational content on par with human-authored content, the implications would be significant for further scaling of computer tutoring system approaches. In this paper, we conduct the first learning gain evaluation of ChatGPT by comparing the efficacy of its hints with hints authored by human tutors with 77 participants across two algebra topic areas, Elementary Algebra and Intermediate Algebra. We find that 70% of hints produced by ChatGPT passed our manual quality checks and that both human and ChatGPT conditions produced positive learning gains. However, gains were only statistically significant for human tutor created hints. Learning gains from human-created hints were substantially and statistically significantly higher than ChatGPT hints in both topic areas, though ChatGPT participants in the Intermediate Algebra experiment were near ceiling and not even with the control at pre-test. We discuss the limitations of our study and suggest several future directions for the field. Problem and hint content used in the experiment is provided for replicability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Domain generalization is a challenging problem in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model that can generalize well to unseen target domains without prior knowledge of these domains. Despite the recent success of deep neural networks, there remains a lack of effective methods for domain generalization using vision transformers. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization technique called Robust Representation Learning with Self-Distillation (RRLD) that utilizes a combination of i) intermediate-block self-distillation and ii) augmentation-guided self-distillation to improve the generalization capabilities of transformer-based models on unseen domains. This approach enables the network to learn robust and general features that are invariant to different augmentations and domain shifts while effectively mitigating overfitting to source domains. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on PACS [1] and OfficeHome [2] benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world wafer semiconductor defect dataset [3]. Our results demonstrate that RRLD achieves robust and accurate generalization performance. We observe an improvement in the range of 0.3% to 2.3% over the state-of-the-art on the three datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a method for scene-level sketch-to-photo synthesis with text guidance. Although object-level sketch-to-photo synthesis has been widely studied, whole-scene synthesis is still challenging without reference photos that adequately reflect the target style. To this end, we leverage knowledge from recent large-scale pre-trained generative models, resulting in text-guided sketch-to-photo synthesis without the need for reference images. To train our model, we use self-supervised learning from a set of photographs. Specifically, we use a pre-trained edge detector that maps both color and sketch images into a standardized edge domain, which reduces the gap between photograph-based edge images (during training) and hand-drawn sketch images (during inference). We implement our method by fine-tuning a latent diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion) with sketch and text conditions. Experiments show that the proposed method translates original sketch images that are not extracted from color images into photos with compelling visual quality. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Synthesizing face images from monochrome sketches is one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of image-to-image translation. However, it is still challenging to (1)~make models learn the high-dimensional face features such as geometry and color, and (2)~take into account the characteristics of input sketches. Existing methods often use sketches as indirect inputs (or as auxiliary inputs) to guide the models, resulting in the loss of sketch features or the alteration of geometry information. In this paper, we introduce a Sketch-Guided Latent Diffusion Model (SGLDM), an LDM-based network architect trained on the paired sketch-face dataset. We apply a Multi-Auto-Encoder (AE) to encode the different input sketches from different regions of a face from pixel space to a feature map in latent space, which enables us to reduce the dimension of the sketch input while preserving the geometry-related information of local face details. We build a sketch-face paired dataset based on the existing method that extracts the edge map from an image. We then introduce a Stochastic Region Abstraction (SRA), an approach to augment our dataset to improve the robustness of SGLDM to handle sketch input with arbitrary abstraction. The evaluation study shows that SGLDM can synthesize high-quality face images with different expressions, facial accessories, and hairstyles from various sketches with different abstraction levels. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent work on predicting category structure with distributional models, using either static word embeddings (Heyman and Heyman, 2019) or contextualized language models (CLMs) (Misra et al., 2021), report low correlations with human ratings, thus calling into question their plausibility as models of human semantic memory. In this work, we revisit this question testing a wider array of methods for probing CLMs for predicting typicality scores. Our experiments, using BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), show the importance of using the right type of CLM probes, as our best BERT-based typicality prediction methods substantially improve over previous works. Second, our results highlight the importance of polysemy in this task: our best results are obtained when using a disambiguation mechanism. Finally, additional experiments reveal that Information Contentbased WordNet (Miller, 1995), also endowed with disambiguation, match the performance of the best BERT-based method, and in fact capture complementary information, which can be combined with BERT to achieve enhanced typicality predictions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the advent of strong pre-trained natural language processing models like BERT, DeBERTa, MiniLM, T5, the data requirement for industries to fine-tune these models to their niche use cases has drastically reduced (typically to a few hundred annotated samples for achieving a reasonable performance). However, the availability of even a few hundred annotated samples may not always be guaranteed in low resource domains like automotive, which often limits the usage of such deep learning models in an industrial setting. In this paper we aim to address the challenge of fine-tuning such pre-trained models with only a few annotated samples, also known as Few-shot learning. Our experiments focus on evaluating the performance of a diverse set of algorithms and methodologies to achieve the task of classifying BOSCH automotive domain textual software requirements into 3 categories, while utilizing only 15 annotated samples per category for fine-tuning. We find that while SciBERT and DeBERTa based models tend to be the most accurate at 15 training samples, their performance improvement scales minimally as the number of annotated samples is increased to 50 in comparison to Siamese and T5 based models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Accurate localization of fovea is one of the primary steps in analyzing retinal diseases since it helps prevent irreversible vision loss. Although current deep learning-based methods achieve better performance than traditional methods, there still remain challenges such as utilizing anatomical landmarks insufficiently, sensitivity to diseased retinal images and various image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture (Bilateral-Fuser) for multi-cue fusion. This architecture explicitly incorporates long-range connections and global features using retina and vessel distributions for robust fovea localization. We introduce a spatial attention mechanism in the dual-stream encoder for extracting and fusing self-learned anatomical information. This design focuses more on features distributed along blood vessels and significantly decreases computational costs by reducing token numbers.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Digital twin is a key enabler to facilitate the development and implementation of new technologies in 5G and beyond networks. However, the complex structure and diverse functions of the current 5G core network, especially the control plane, lead to difficulties in building the core network of the digital twin. In this paper, we propose two novel data-driven architectures for modeling the 5G control plane and implement corresponding deep learning models, namely 5GC-Seq2Seq and 5GC-former, based on the Vanilla Seq2Seq model and Transformer decoder respectively. To train and test models, we also present a solution that allows the signaling messages to be interconverted with vectors, which can be utilized in dataset construction. The experiments are based on 5G core network signaling data collected by the Spirent C50 network tester, including various procedures related to registration, handover, PDU sessions, etc. Our results show that 5GC-Seq2Seq achieves over 99.98% F1-score (A metric to measure the accuracy of positive samples) with a relatively simple structure, while 5GC-former attains higher than 99.998% F1-score by establishing a more complex and highly parallel model, indicating that the method proposed in this paper reproduces the major functions of the core network control plane in 5G digital twin with high accuracy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Our solution focuses on enhancing the ranking stage, where we fine-tune pre-trained multilingual transformer-based models with MIRACL dataset. Our model improvement is mainly achieved through diverse data engineering techniques, including the collection of additional relevant training data, data augmentation, and negative sampling. Our fine-tuned model effectively determines the semantic relevance between queries and documents, resulting in a significant improvement in the efficiency of the multilingual information retrieval process.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Sharpness of minima is a promising quantity that can correlate with generalization in deep networks and, when optimized during training, can improve generalization. However, standard sharpness is not invariant under reparametrizations of neural networks, and, to fix this, reparametrization-invariant sharpness definitions have been proposed, most prominently adaptive sharpness (Kwon et al., 2021). But does it really capture generalization in modern practical settings? We comprehensively explore this question in a detailed study of various definitions of adaptive sharpness in settings ranging from training from scratch on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 to fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet and BERT on MNLI. We focus mostly on transformers for which little is known in terms of sharpness despite their widespread usage. Overall, we observe that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization but rather with some training parameters like the learning rate that can be positively or negatively correlated with generalization depending on the setup. Interestingly, in multiple cases, we observe a consistent negative correlation of sharpness with out-of-distribution error implying that sharper minima can generalize better. Finally, we illustrate on a simple model that the right sharpness measure is highly data-dependent, and that we do not understand well this aspect for realistic data distributions.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion auction refers to an emerging paradigm of online marketplace where an auctioneer utilises a social network to attract potential buyers. Diffusion auction poses significant privacy risks. From the auction outcome, it is possible to infer hidden, and potentially sensitive, preferences of buyers. To mitigate such risks, we initiate the study of differential privacy (DP) in diffusion auction mechanisms. DP is a well-established notion of privacy that protects a system against inference attacks. Achieving DP in diffusion auctions is non-trivial as the well-designed auction rules are required to incentivise the buyers to truthfully report their neighbourhood. We study the single-unit case and design two differentially private diffusion mechanisms (DPDMs): recursive DPDM and layered DPDM. We prove that these mechanisms guarantee differential privacy, incentive compatibility and individual rationality for both valuations and neighbourhood. We then empirically compare their performance on real and synthetic datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Discovering entity mentions that are out of a Knowledge Base (KB) from texts plays a critical role in KB maintenance, but has not yet been fully explored. The current methods are mostly limited to the simple threshold-based approach and feature-based classification; the datasets for evaluation are relatively rare. In this work, we propose BLINKout, a new BERT-based Entity Linking (EL) method which can identify mentions that do not have a corresponding KB entity by matching them to a special NIL entity. To this end, we integrate novel techniques including NIL representation, NIL classification, and synonym enhancement. We also propose Ontology Pruning and Versioning strategies to construct out-of-KB mentions from normal, in-KB EL datasets. Results on four datasets of clinical notes and publications show that BLINKout outperforms existing methods to detect out-of-KB mentions for medical ontologies UMLS and SNOMED CT. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance in various generation tasks. However, their theoretical foundations fall far behind. This paper studies score approximation, estimation, and distribution recovery of diffusion models, when data are supported on an unknown low-dimensional linear subspace. Our result provides sample complexity bounds for distribution estimation using diffusion models. We show that with a properly chosen neural network architecture, the score function can be both accurately approximated and efficiently estimated. Furthermore, the generated distribution based on the estimated score function captures the data geometric structures and converges to a close vicinity of the data distribution. The convergence rate depends on the subspace dimension, indicating that diffusion models can circumvent the curse of data ambient dimensionality. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work studies the semantic representations learned by BERT for compounds, that is, expressions such as sunlight or bodyguard. We build on recent studies that explore semantic information in Transformers at the word level and test whether BERT aligns with human semantic intuitions when dealing with expressions (e.g., sunlight) whose overall meaning depends -- to a various extent -- on the semantics of the constituent words (sun, light). We leverage a dataset that includes human judgments on two psycholinguistic measures of compound semantic analysis: lexeme meaning dominance (LMD; quantifying the weight of each constituent toward the compound meaning) and semantic transparency (ST; evaluating the extent to which the compound meaning is recoverable from the constituents' semantics). We show that BERT-based measures moderately align with human intuitions, especially when using contextualized representations, and that LMD is overall more predictable than ST. Contrary to the results reported for 'standard' words, higher, more contextualized layers are the best at representing compound meaning. These findings shed new light on the abilities of BERT in dealing with fine-grained semantic phenomena. Moreover, they can provide insights into how speakers represent compounds. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformers have become the de facto models of choice in machine learning, typically leading to impressive performance on many applications. At the same time, the architectural development in the transformer world is mostly driven by empirical findings, and the theoretical understanding of their architectural building blocks is rather limited. In contrast, Dense Associative Memory models or Modern Hopfield Networks have a well-established theoretical foundation, but have not yet demonstrated truly impressive practical results. We propose a transformer architecture that replaces the sequence of feedforward transformer blocks with a single large Associative Memory model. Our novel architecture, called Energy Transformer (or ET for short), has many of the familiar architectural primitives that are often used in the current generation of transformers. However, it is not identical to the existing architectures. The sequence of transformer layers in ET is purposely designed to minimize a specifically engineered energy function, which is responsible for representing the relationships between the tokens. As a consequence of this computational principle, the attention in ET is different from the conventional attention mechanism. In this work, we introduce the theoretical foundations of ET, explore it's empirical capabilities using the image completion task, and obtain strong quantitative results on the graph anomaly detection task. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential in clinical applications, providing valuable medical knowledge and advice. For example, a large dialog LLM like ChatGPT has successfully passed part of the US medical licensing exam. However, LLMs currently have difficulty processing images, making it challenging to interpret information from medical images, which are rich in information that supports clinical decisions. On the other hand, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) networks for medical images have seen significant success in the medical field by using advanced deep-learning algorithms to support clinical decision-making. This paper presents a method for integrating LLMs into medical-image CAD networks. The proposed framework uses LLMs to enhance the output of multiple CAD networks, such as diagnosis networks, lesion segmentation networks, and report generation networks, by summarizing and reorganizing the information presented in natural language text format. The goal is to merge the strengths of LLMs' medical domain knowledge and logical reasoning with the vision understanding capability of existing medical-image CAD models to create a more user-friendly and understandable system for patients compared to conventional CAD systems. In the future, LLM's medical knowledge can be also used to improve the performance of vision-based medical-image CAD models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion-based generative models (DBGMs) perturb data to a target noise distribution and reverse this inference diffusion process to generate samples. The choice of inference diffusion affects both likelihoods and sample quality. For example, extending the inference process with auxiliary variables leads to improved sample quality. While there are many such multivariate diffusions to explore, each new one requires significant model-specific analysis, hindering rapid prototyping and evaluation. In this work, we study Multivariate Diffusion Models (MDMs). For any number of auxiliary variables, we provide a recipe for maximizing a lower-bound on the MDMs likelihood without requiring any model-specific analysis. We then demonstrate how to parameterize the diffusion for a specified target noise distribution; these two points together enable optimizing the inference diffusion process. Optimizing the diffusion expands easy experimentation from just a few well-known processes to an automatic search over all linear diffusions. To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific diffusions as well as learn a diffusion process on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet32 datasets. We show learned MDMs match or surpass bits-per-dims (BPDs) relative to fixed choices of diffusions for a given dataset and model architecture. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Spectral clustering and diffusion maps are celebrated dimensionality reduction algorithms built on eigen-elements related to the diffusive structure of the data. The core of these procedures is the approximation of a Laplacian through a graph kernel approach, however this local average construction is known to be cursed by the high-dimension d. In this article, we build a different estimator of the Laplacian, via a reproducing kernel Hilbert space method, which adapts naturally to the regularity of the problem. We provide non-asymptotic statistical rates proving that the kernel estimator we build can circumvent the curse of dimensionality. Finally we discuss techniques (Nystr\"om subsampling, Fourier features) that enable to reduce the computational cost of the estimator while not degrading its overall performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Investigating the relationship between internal tissue point motion of the tongue and oropharyngeal muscle deformation measured from tagged MRI and intelligible speech can aid in advancing speech motor control theories and developing novel treatment methods for speech related-disorders. However, elucidating the relationship between these two sources of information is challenging, due in part to the disparity in data structure between spatiotemporal motion fields (i.e., 4D motion fields) and one-dimensional audio waveforms. In this work, we present an efficient encoder-decoder translation network for exploring the predictive information inherent in 4D motion fields via 2D spectrograms as a surrogate of the audio data. Specifically, our encoder is based on 3D convolutional spatial modeling and transformer-based temporal modeling. The extracted features are processed by an asymmetric 2D convolution decoder to generate spectrograms that correspond to 4D motion fields. Furthermore, we incorporate a generative adversarial training approach into our framework to further improve synthesis quality on our generated spectrograms. We experiment on 63 paired motion field sequences and speech waveforms, demonstrating that our framework enables the generation of clear audio waveforms from a sequence of motion fields. Thus, our framework has the potential to improve our understanding of the relationship between these two modalities and inform the development of treatments for speech disorders. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
