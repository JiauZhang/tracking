### [The Infinite Index: Information Retrieval on Generative Text-To-Image  Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07476)
The text-to-image model Stable Diffusion has recently become very popular. Only weeks after its open source release, millions are experimenting with image generation. This is due to its ease of use, since all it takes is a brief description of the desired image to "prompt" the generative model. Rarely do the images generated for a new prompt immediately meet the user's expectations. Usually, an iterative refinement of the prompt ("prompt engineering") is necessary for satisfying images. As a new perspective, we recast image prompt engineering as interactive image retrieval - on an "infinite index". Thereby, a prompt corresponds to a query and prompt engineering to query refinement. Selected image-prompt pairs allow direct relevance feedback, as the model can modify an image for the refined prompt. This is a form of one-sided interactive retrieval, where the initiative is on the user side, whereas the server side remains stateless. In light of an extensive literature review, we develop these parallels in detail and apply the findings to a case study of a creative search task on such a model. We note that the uncertainty in searching an infinite index is virtually never-ending. We also discuss future research opportunities related to retrieval models specialized for generative models and interactive generative image retrieval. The application of IR technology, such as query reformulation and relevance feedback, will contribute to improved workflows when using generative models, while the notion of an infinite index raises new challenges in IR research. 

### [Diffusion Probabilistic Models beat GANs on Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07501)
The success of Deep Learning applications critically depends on the quality and scale of the underlying training data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate arbitrary large datasets, but diversity and fidelity are limited, which has recently been addressed by denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) whose superiority has been demonstrated on natural images. In this study, we propose Medfusion, a conditional latent DDPM for medical images. We compare our DDPM-based model against GAN-based models, which constitute the current state-of-the-art in the medical domain. Medfusion was trained and compared with (i) StyleGan-3 on n=101,442 images from the AIROGS challenge dataset to generate fundoscopies with and without glaucoma, (ii) ProGAN on n=191,027 from the CheXpert dataset to generate radiographs with and without cardiomegaly and (iii) wGAN on n=19,557 images from the CRCMS dataset to generate histopathological images with and without microsatellite stability. In the AIROGS, CRMCS, and CheXpert datasets, Medfusion achieved lower (=better) FID than the GANs (11.63 versus 20.43, 30.03 versus 49.26, and 17.28 versus 84.31). Also, fidelity (precision) and diversity (recall) were higher (=better) for Medfusion in all three datasets. Our study shows that DDPM are a superior alternative to GANs for image synthesis in the medical domain. 

### [Invariant Lipschitz Bandits: A Side Observation Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07524)
Symmetry arises in many optimization and decision-making problems, and has attracted considerable attention from the optimization community: By utilizing the existence of such symmetries, the process of searching for optimal solutions can be improved significantly. Despite its success in (offline) optimization, the utilization of symmetries has not been well examined within the online optimization settings, especially in the bandit literature. As such, in this paper we study the invariant Lipschitz bandit setting, a subclass of the Lipschitz bandits where the reward function and the set of arms are preserved under a group of transformations. We introduce an algorithm named \texttt{UniformMesh-N}, which naturally integrates side observations using group orbits into the \texttt{UniformMesh} algorithm (\cite{Kleinberg2005_UniformMesh}), which uniformly discretizes the set of arms. Using the side-observation approach, we prove an improved regret upper bound, which depends on the cardinality of the group, given that the group is finite. We also prove a matching regret's lower bound for the invariant Lipschitz bandit class (up to logarithmic factors). We hope that our work will ignite further investigation of symmetry in bandit theory and sequential decision-making theory in general. 

### [Causes and Cures for Interference in Multilingual Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07530)
Multilingual machine translation models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs, but also suffer from interference. While there is a growing number of sophisticated methods that aim to eliminate interference, our understanding of interference as a phenomenon is still limited. This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference in multilingual machine translation. Through systematic experimentation, we find that interference (or synergy) are primarily determined by model size, data size, and the proportion of each language pair within the total dataset. We observe that substantial interference occurs mainly when the model is very small with respect to the available training data, and that using standard transformer configurations with less than one billion parameters largely alleviates interference and promotes synergy. Moreover, we show that tuning the sampling temperature to control the proportion of each language pair in the data is key to balancing the amount of interference between low and high resource language pairs effectively, and can lead to superior performance overall. 

### [Solve the Puzzle of Instance Segmentation in Videos: A Weakly Supervised  Framework with Spatio-Temporal Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07592)
Instance segmentation in videos, which aims to segment and track multiple objects in video frames, has garnered a flurry of research attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised framework with \textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}ollaboration for instance \textbf{Seg}mentation in videos, namely \textbf{STC-Seg}. Concretely, STC-Seg demonstrates four contributions. First, we leverage the complementary representations from unsupervised depth estimation and optical flow to produce effective pseudo-labels for training deep networks and predicting high-quality instance masks. Second, to enhance the mask generation, we devise a puzzle loss, which enables end-to-end training using box-level annotations. Third, our tracking module jointly utilizes bounding-box diagonal points with spatio-temporal discrepancy to model movements, which largely improves the robustness to different object appearances. Finally, our framework is flexible and enables image-level instance segmentation methods to operate the video-level task. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on the KITTI MOTS and YT-VIS datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance and even outperforms fully supervised TrackR-CNN and MaskTrack R-CNN. We believe that STC-Seg can be a valuable addition to the community, as it reflects the tip of an iceberg about the innovative opportunities in the weakly supervised paradigm for instance segmentation in videos. 

### [Output-Dependent Gaussian Process State-Space Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07608)
Gaussian process state-space model (GPSSM) is a fully probabilistic state-space model that has attracted much attention over the past decade. However, the outputs of the transition function in the existing GPSSMs are assumed to be independent, meaning that the GPSSMs cannot exploit the inductive biases between different outputs and lose certain model capacities. To address this issue, this paper proposes an output-dependent and more realistic GPSSM by utilizing the well-known, simple yet practical linear model of coregionalization (LMC) framework to represent the output dependency. To jointly learn the output-dependent GPSSM and infer the latent states, we propose a variational sparse GP-based learning method that only gently increases the computational complexity. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the output-dependent GPSSM in terms of learning and inference performance. 

### [Efficient Pre-training of Masked Language Model via Concept-based  Curriculum Masking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07617)
Masked language modeling (MLM) has been widely used for pre-training effective bidirectional representations, but incurs substantial training costs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept-based curriculum masking (CCM) method to efficiently pre-train a language model. CCM has two key differences from existing curriculum learning approaches to effectively reflect the nature of MLM. First, we introduce a carefully-designed linguistic difficulty criterion that evaluates the MLM difficulty of each token. Second, we construct a curriculum that gradually masks words related to the previously masked words by retrieving a knowledge graph. Experimental results show that CCM significantly improves pre-training efficiency. Specifically, the model trained with CCM shows comparative performance with the original BERT on the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark at half of the training cost. 

### [Gradient-based Intra-attention Pruning on Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07634)
Pre-trained language models achieve superior performance, but they are computationally expensive due to their large size. Techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation (KD) have been developed to reduce their size and latency. In most structural pruning methods, the pruning units, such as attention heads and feed-forward hidden dimensions, only span a small model structure space and limit the structures that the pruning algorithm can explore. In this work, we propose Gradient-based Intra-attention pruning (GRAIN), which inspects fine intra-attention structures, and allows different heads to have different sizes. Intra-attention pruning greatly expands the searching space of model structures and yields highly heterogeneous structures. We further propose structure regularization to encourage generating more regular structures, which achieves higher speedups than heterogeneous ones. We also integrate KD into the pruning process with a gradient separation strategy to reduce the interference of KD with the pruning process. GRAIN is evaluated on a variety of tasks. Results show that it notably outperforms other methods at the same or similar model size. Even under extreme compression where only $3\%$ weights in transformers remain, the pruned model is still competitive. 

### [Summary-Oriented Vision Modeling for Multimodal Abstractive  Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07672)
The goal of multimodal abstractive summarization (MAS) is to produce a concise summary given the multimodal data (text and vision). Existing studies on MAS mainly focus on how to effectively use the extracted visual features, having achieved impressive success on the high-resource English dataset. However, less attention has been paid to the quality of the visual features to the summary, which may limit the model performance especially in the low- and zero-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose to improve the summary quality through summary-oriented visual features. To this end, we devise two auxiliary tasks including \emph{vision to summary task} and \emph{masked image modeling task}. Together with the main summarization task, we optimize the MAS model via the training objectives of all these tasks. By these means, the MAS model can be enhanced by capturing the summary-oriented visual features, thereby yielding more accurate summaries. Experiments on 44 languages, covering mid-high-, low-, and zero-resource scenarios, verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance under all scenarios. 

### [HUM3DIL: Semi-supervised Multi-modal 3D Human Pose Estimation for  Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07729)
Autonomous driving is an exciting new industry, posing important research questions. Within the perception module, 3D human pose estimation is an emerging technology, which can enable the autonomous vehicle to perceive and understand the subtle and complex behaviors of pedestrians. While hardware systems and sensors have dramatically improved over the decades -- with cars potentially boasting complex LiDAR and vision systems and with a growing expansion of the available body of dedicated datasets for this newly available information -- not much work has been done to harness these novel signals for the core problem of 3D human pose estimation. Our method, which we coin HUM3DIL (HUMan 3D from Images and LiDAR), efficiently makes use of these complementary signals, in a semi-supervised fashion and outperforms existing methods with a large margin. It is a fast and compact model for onboard deployment. Specifically, we embed LiDAR points into pixel-aligned multi-modal features, which we pass through a sequence of Transformer refinement stages. Quantitative experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset support these claims, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the task of 3D pose estimation. 

### [Sim-to-Real Transfer for Quadrupedal Locomotion via Terrain Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07740)
Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as an appealing alternative for legged locomotion over multiple terrains by training a policy in physical simulation and then transferring it to the real world (i.e., sim-to-real transfer). Despite considerable progress, the capacity and scalability of traditional neural networks are still limited, which may hinder their applications in more complex environments. In contrast, the Transformer architecture has shown its superiority in a wide range of large-scale sequence modeling tasks, including natural language processing and decision-making problems. In this paper, we propose Terrain Transformer (TERT), a high-capacity Transformer model for quadrupedal locomotion control on various terrains. Furthermore, to better leverage Transformer in sim-to-real scenarios, we present a novel two-stage training framework consisting of an offline pretraining stage and an online correction stage, which can naturally integrate Transformer with privileged training. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that TERT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different terrains in terms of return, energy consumption and control smoothness. In further real-world validation, TERT successfully traverses nine challenging terrains, including sand pit and stair down, which can not be accomplished by strong baselines. 

### [Combating Uncertainty and Class Imbalance in Facial Expression  Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07751)
Recognition of facial expression is a challenge when it comes to computer vision. The primary reasons are class imbalance due to data collection and uncertainty due to inherent noise such as fuzzy facial expressions and inconsistent labels. However, current research has focused either on the problem of class imbalance or on the problem of uncertainty, ignoring the intersection of how to address these two problems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework based on Resnet and Attention to solve the above problems. We design weight for each class. Through the penalty mechanism, our model will pay more attention to the learning of small samples during training, and the resulting decrease in model accuracy can be improved by a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Meanwhile, our backbone network will also learn an uncertain feature for each sample. By mixing uncertain features between samples, the model can better learn those features that can be used for classification, thus suppressing uncertainty. Experiments show that our method surpasses most basic methods in terms of accuracy on facial expression data sets (e.g., AffectNet, RAF-DB), and it also solves the problem of class imbalance well. 

### [Put Attention to Temporal Saliency Patterns of Multi-Horizon Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07771)
Time series, sets of sequences in chronological order, are essential data in statistical research with many forecasting applications. Although recent performance in many Transformer-based models has been noticeable, long multi-horizon time series forecasting remains a very challenging task. Going beyond transformers in sequence translation and transduction research, we observe the effects of down-and-up samplings that can nudge temporal saliency patterns to emerge in time sequences. Motivated by the mentioned observation, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Saliency Detection (TSD), on top of the attention mechanism and apply it to multi-horizon time series prediction. We renovate the traditional encoder-decoder architecture by making as a series of deep convolutional blocks to work in tandem with the multi-head self-attention. The proposed TSD approach facilitates the multiresolution of saliency patterns upon condensed multi-heads, thus progressively enhancing complex time series forecasting. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed approach has significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmark datasets in many far-horizon forecasting settings. Overall, TSD achieves 31% and 46% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art models in multivariate and univariate time series forecasting scenarios on standard benchmarks. The Git repository is available at https://github.com/duongtrung/time-series-temporal-saliency-patterns. 

### [Do altmetric scores reflect article quality? Evidence from the UK  Research Excellence Framework 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07811)
Altmetrics are web-based quantitative impact or attention indicators for academic articles that have been proposed to supplement citation counts. This article reports the first assessment of the extent to which mature altmetrics from Altmetric.com and Mendeley associate with journal article quality. It exploits expert norm-referenced peer review scores from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021 for 67,030+ journal articles in all fields 2014-17/18, split into 34 Units of Assessment (UoAs). The results show that altmetrics are better indicators of research quality than previously thought, although not as good as raw and field normalised Scopus citation counts. Surprisingly, field normalising citation counts can reduce their strength as a quality indicator for articles in a single field. For most UoAs, Mendeley reader counts are the best, tweet counts are also a relatively strong indicator in many fields, and Facebook, blogs and news citations are moderately strong indicators in some UoAs, at least in the UK. In general, altmetrics are the strongest indicators of research quality in the health and physical sciences and weakest in the arts and humanities. The Altmetric Attention Score, although hybrid, is almost as good as Mendeley reader counts as a quality indicator and reflects more non-scholarly impacts. 

### [DETR4D: Direct Multi-View 3D Object Detection with Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07849)
3D object detection with surround-view images is an essential task for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose DETR4D, a Transformer-based framework that explores sparse attention and direct feature query for 3D object detection in multi-view images. We design a novel projective cross-attention mechanism for query-image interaction to address the limitations of existing methods in terms of geometric cue exploitation and information loss for cross-view objects. In addition, we introduce a heatmap generation technique that bridges 3D and 2D spaces efficiently via query initialization. Furthermore, unlike the common practice of fusing intermediate spatial features for temporal aggregation, we provide a new perspective by introducing a novel hybrid approach that performs cross-frame fusion over past object queries and image features, enabling efficient and robust modeling of temporal information. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DETR4D. 

### [Attention as a guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07850)
The study of the attention mechanism has sparked interest in many fields, such as language modeling and machine translation. Although its patterns have been exploited to perform different tasks, from neural network understanding to textual alignment, no previous work has analysed the encoder-decoder attention behavior in speech translation (ST) nor used it to improve ST on a specific task. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing an attention-based policy (EDAtt) for simultaneous ST (SimulST) that is motivated by an analysis of the existing attention relations between audio input and textual output. Its goal is to leverage the encoder-decoder attention scores to guide inference in real time. Results on en->{de, es} show that the EDAtt policy achieves overall better results compared to the SimulST state of the art, especially in terms of computational-aware latency. 

### [QueryPose: Sparse Multi-Person Pose Regression via Spatial-Aware  Part-Level Query](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07855)
We propose a sparse end-to-end multi-person pose regression framework, termed QueryPose, which can directly predict multi-person keypoint sequences from the input image. The existing end-to-end methods rely on dense representations to preserve the spatial detail and structure for precise keypoint localization. However, the dense paradigm introduces complex and redundant post-processes during inference. In our framework, each human instance is encoded by several learnable spatial-aware part-level queries associated with an instance-level query. First, we propose the Spatial Part Embedding Generation Module (SPEGM) that considers the local spatial attention mechanism to generate several spatial-sensitive part embeddings, which contain spatial details and structural information for enhancing the part-level queries. Second, we introduce the Selective Iteration Module (SIM) to adaptively update the sparse part-level queries via the generated spatial-sensitive part embeddings stage-by-stage. Based on the two proposed modules, the part-level queries are able to fully encode the spatial details and structural information for precise keypoint regression. With the bipartite matching, QueryPose avoids the hand-designed post-processes and surpasses the existing dense end-to-end methods with 73.6 AP on MS COCO mini-val set and 72.7 AP on CrowdPose test set. Code is available at https://github.com/buptxyb666/QueryPose. 

### [Full Contextual Attention for Multi-resolution Transformers in Semantic  Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07890)
Transformers have proved to be very effective for visual recognition tasks. In particular, vision transformers construct compressed global representations through self-attention and learnable class tokens. Multi-resolution transformers have shown recent successes in semantic segmentation but can only capture local interactions in high-resolution feature maps. This paper extends the notion of global tokens to build GLobal Attention Multi-resolution (GLAM) transformers. GLAM is a generic module that can be integrated into most existing transformer backbones. GLAM includes learnable global tokens, which unlike previous methods can model interactions between all image regions, and extracts powerful representations during training. Extensive experiments show that GLAM-Swin or GLAM-Swin-UNet exhibit substantially better performances than their vanilla counterparts on ADE20K and Cityscapes. Moreover, GLAM can be used to segment large 3D medical images, and GLAM-nnFormer achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the BCV dataset. 

### [Modern Location-based Service Technologies: Visible Light Positioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07896)
With the development of wireless communications and the increasing computing power of variety mobile devices, LBS (Location Based Service) technologies getting more and more attention as it can provide most flexibility and convenience in modern people' s life. For this survey, we will first give a comprehensive introduction about LBS, including definition, advantages, application, and potential privacy problem. Then, we will present more detailed discussion focusing on the location technologies which is an essential part in LBS framework. 

### [Five Facets of 6G: Research Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07902)
Whilst the fifth-generation (5G) systems are being rolled out across the globe, researchers have turned their attention to the exploration of radical next-generation solutions. At this early evolutionary stage we survey five main research facets of this field, namely {\em Facet~1: next-generation architectures, spectrum and services, Facet~2: next-generation networking, Facet~3: Internet of Things (IoT), Facet~4: wireless positioning and sensing, as well as Facet~5: applications of deep learning in 6G networks.} In this paper, we have provided a critical appraisal of the literature of promising techniques ranging from the associated architectures, networking, applications as well as designs. We have portrayed a plethora of heterogeneous architectures relying on cooperative hybrid networks supported by diverse access and transmission mechanisms. The vulnerabilities of these techniques are also addressed and carefully considered for highlighting the most of promising future research directions. Additionally, we have listed a rich suite of learning-driven optimization techniques. We conclude by observing the evolutionary paradigm-shift that has taken place from pure single-component bandwidth-efficiency, power-efficiency or delay-optimization towards multi-component designs, as exemplified by the twin-component ultra-reliable low-latency mode of the 5G system. We advocate a further evolutionary step towards multi-component Pareto optimization, which requires the exploration of the entire Pareto front of all optiomal solutions, where none of the components of the objective function may be improved without degrading at least one of the other components. 

### [Flow Lenia: Mass conservation for the study of virtual creatures in  continuous cellular automata](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07906)
Lenia is a family of cellular automata (CA) generalizing Conway's Game of Life to continuous space, time and states. Lenia has attracted a lot of attention because of the wide diversity of self-organizing patterns it can generate. Among those, some spatially localized patterns (SLPs) resemble life-like artificial creatures. However, those creatures are found in only a small subspace of the Lenia parameter space and are not trivial to discover, necessitating advanced search algorithms. We hypothesize that adding a mass conservation constraint could facilitate the emergence of SLPs. We propose here an extension of the Lenia model, called Flow Lenia, which enables mass conservation. We show a few observations demonstrating its effectiveness in generating SLPs with complex behaviors. Furthermore, we show how Flow Lenia enables the integration of the parameters of the CA update rules within the CA dynamics, making them dynamic and localized. This allows for multi-species simulations, with locally coherent update rules that define properties of the emerging creatures, and that can be mixed with neighbouring rules. We argue that this paves the way for the intrinsic evolution of self-organized artificial life forms within continuous CAs. 

### [Automatic vehicle trajectory data reconstruction at scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07907)
Vehicle trajectory data has received increasing research attention over the past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates proper processing to ensure data quality. We draw particular attention to extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given "raw" vehicle detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms. We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee. 

### [The Effects of In-domain Corpus Size on pre-training BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07914)
Many prior language modeling efforts have shown that pre-training on an in-domain corpus can significantly improve performance on downstream domain-specific NLP tasks. However, the difficulties associated with collecting enough in-domain data might discourage researchers from approaching this pre-training task. In this paper, we conducted a series of experiments by pre-training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with different sizes of biomedical corpora. The results demonstrate that pre-training on a relatively small amount of in-domain data (4GB) with limited training steps, can lead to better performance on downstream domain-specific NLP tasks compared with fine-tuning models pre-trained on general corpora. 

### [Visually-augmented pretrained language models for NLP tasks without  images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07937)
Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown impressive performance by text-only self-supervised training, they are found lack of visual semantics or commonsense, e.g., sizes, shapes, and colors of commonplace objects. Existing solutions often rely on explicit images for visual knowledge augmentation (requiring time-consuming retrieval or generation), and they also conduct the augmentation for the whole input text, without considering whether it is actually needed in specific inputs or tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel visually-augmented fine-tuning approach that can be generally applied to various PLMs or NLP tasks, without using any retrieved or generated images, namely VAWI. Specifically, we first identify the visually-hungry words (VH-words) from input text via a token selector, where three different methods have been proposed, including syntax-, attention- and learning-based strategies. Then, we adopt a fixed CLIP text encoder to generate the visually-augmented representations of these VH-words. As it has been pre-trained by vision-language alignment task on the large-scale corpus, it is capable of injecting visual semantics into the aligned text representations. Finally, the visually-augmented features will be fused and transformed into the pre-designed visual prompts based on VH-words, which can be inserted into PLMs to enrich the visual semantics in word representations. We conduct extensive experiments on ten NLP tasks, i.e., GLUE benchmark, CommonsenseQA, CommonGen, and SNLI-VE. Experimental results show that our approach can consistently improve the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, BART, and T5 at different scales, and outperform several competitive baselines significantly. Our codes and data are publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/VAWI}. 

### [Combining information-seeking exploration and reward maximization:  Unified inference on continuous state and action spaces under partial  observability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07946)
Reinforcement learning (RL) gained considerable attention by creating decision-making agents that maximize rewards received from fully observable environments. However, many real-world problems are partially or noisily observable by nature, where agents do not receive the true and complete state of the environment. Such problems are formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Some studies applied RL to POMDPs by recalling previous decisions and observations or inferring the true state of the environment from received observations. Nevertheless, aggregating observations and decisions over time is impractical for environments with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Moreover, so-called inference-based RL approaches require large number of samples to perform well since agents eschew uncertainty in the inferred state for the decision-making. Active inference is a framework that is naturally formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select decisions by minimising expected free energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximising (exploitative) behaviour in RL, with an information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of active inference, its usage is limited to discrete state and action spaces due to the computational difficulty of the EFE. We propose a unified principle for joint information-seeking and reward maximization that clarifies a theoretical connection between active inference and RL, unifies active inference and RL, and overcomes their aforementioned limitations. Our findings are supported by strong theoretical analysis. The proposed framework's superior exploration property is also validated by experimental results on partial observable tasks with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Moreover, the results show that our model solves reward-free problems, making task reward design optional. 

### [Vision Transformers are Parameter-Efficient Audio-Visual Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07983)
Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results on various computer vision tasks in the last several years. In this work, we study the capability of frozen ViTs, pretrained only on visual data, to generalize to audio-visual data without finetuning any of its original parameters. To do so, we propose a latent audio-visual hybrid (LAVISH) adapter that adapts pretrained ViTs to audio-visual tasks by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into every layer of a frozen ViT. To efficiently fuse visual and audio cues, our LAVISH adapter uses a small set of latent tokens, which form an attention bottleneck, thus, eliminating the quadratic cost of standard cross-attention. Compared to the existing modality-specific audio-visual methods, our approach achieves competitive or even better performance on various audio-visual tasks while using fewer tunable parameters and without relying on costly audio pretraining or external audio encoders. Our code is available at https://genjib.github.io/project_page/LAVISH/ 

### [Political advertisement on Facebook and Instagram in the run-up to 2022  Italian general election](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08021)
Targeted advertising on online social platforms has become increasingly relevant in the political marketing toolkit. Monitoring political advertising is crucial to ensure accountability and transparency of democratic processes. Leveraging Meta public library of sponsored content, we study the extent to which political ads were delivered on Facebook and Instagram in the run-up to 2022 Italian general election. Analyzing over 23 k unique ads paid by 2.7 k unique sponsors, with an associated amount spent of 4 M EUR and over 1 billion views generated, we investigate temporal, geographical, and demographic patterns of the political campaigning activity of main coalitions. We find results that are in accordance with their political agenda and the electoral outcome, highlighting how the most active coalitions also obtained most of the votes and showing regional differences that are coherent with the (targeted) political base of each group. Our work raises attention to the need for further studies of digital advertising and its implications for individuals' opinions and choices. 

### [Redefining Relationships in Music](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08038)
AI tools increasingly shape how we discover, make and experience music. While these tools can have the potential to empower creativity, they may fundamentally redefine relationships between stakeholders, to the benefit of some and the detriment of others. In this position paper, we argue that these tools will fundamentally reshape our music culture, with profound effects (for better and for worse) on creators, consumers and the commercial enterprises that often connect them. By paying careful attention to emerging Music AI technologies and developments in other creative domains and understanding the implications, people working in this space could decrease the possible negative impacts on the practice, consumption and meaning of music. Given that many of these technologies are already available, there is some urgency in conducting analyses of these technologies now. It is important that people developing and working with these tools address these issues now to help guide their evolution to be equitable and empower creativity. We identify some potential risks and opportunities associated with existing and forthcoming AI tools for music, though more work is needed to identify concrete actions which leverage the opportunities while mitigating risks. 

### [Image-and-Language Understanding from Pixels Only](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08045)
Multimodal models are becoming increasingly effective, in part due to unified components, such as the Transformer architecture. However, multimodal models still often consist of many task- and modality-specific pieces and training procedures. For example, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) trains independent text and image towers via a contrastive loss. We explore an additional unification: the use of a pure pixel-based model to perform image, text, and multimodal tasks. Our model is trained with contrastive loss alone, so we call it CLIP-Pixels Only (CLIPPO). CLIPPO uses a single encoder that processes both regular images and text rendered as images. CLIPPO performs image-based tasks such as retrieval and zero-shot image classification almost as well as CLIP, with half the number of parameters and no text-specific tower or embedding. When trained jointly via image-text contrastive learning and next-sentence contrastive learning, CLIPPO can perform well on natural language understanding tasks, without any word-level loss (language modelling or masked language modelling), outperforming pixel-based prior work. Surprisingly, CLIPPO can obtain good accuracy in visual question answering, simply by rendering the question and image together. Finally, we exploit the fact that CLIPPO does not require a tokenizer to show that it can achieve strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without 

### [Real-Time Neural Light Field on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08057)
Recent efforts in Neural Rendering Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis by utilizing implicit neural representation to represent 3D scenes. Due to the process of volumetric rendering, the inference speed for NeRF is extremely slow, limiting the application scenarios of utilizing NeRF on resource-constrained hardware, such as mobile devices. Many works have been conducted to reduce the latency of running NeRF models. However, most of them still require high-end GPU for acceleration or extra storage memory, which is all unavailable on mobile devices. Another emerging direction utilizes the neural light field (NeLF) for speedup, as only one forward pass is performed on a ray to predict the pixel color. Nevertheless, to reach a similar rendering quality as NeRF, the network in NeLF is designed with intensive computation, which is not mobile-friendly. In this work, we propose an efficient network that runs in real-time on mobile devices for neural rendering. We follow the setting of NeLF to train our network. Unlike existing works, we introduce a novel network architecture that runs efficiently on mobile devices with low latency and small size, i.e., saving $15\times \sim 24\times$ storage compared with MobileNeRF. Our model achieves high-resolution generation while maintaining real-time inference for both synthetic and real-world scenes on mobile devices, e.g., $18.04$ms (iPhone 13) for rendering one $1008\times756$ image of real 3D scenes. Additionally, we achieve similar image quality as NeRF and better quality than MobileNeRF (PSNR $26.15$ vs. $25.91$ on the real-world forward-facing dataset). 

### [Rethinking Vision Transformers for MobileNet Size and Speed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08059)
With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose an improved supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a fine-grained joint search strategy that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve about $4\%$ higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV2$\times1.4$ on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. We demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance with MobileNet-level size and speed. 

### [Mod-Squad: Designing Mixture of Experts As Modular Multi-Task Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08066)
Optimization in multi-task learning (MTL) is more challenging than single-task learning (STL), as the gradient from different tasks can be contradictory. When tasks are related, it can be beneficial to share some parameters among them (cooperation). However, some tasks require additional parameters with expertise in a specific type of data or discrimination (specialization). To address the MTL challenge, we propose Mod-Squad, a new model that is Modularized into groups of experts (a 'Squad'). This structure allows us to formalize cooperation and specialization as the process of matching experts and tasks. We optimize this matching process during the training of a single model. Specifically, we incorporate mixture of experts (MoE) layers into a transformer model, with a new loss that incorporates the mutual dependence between tasks and experts. As a result, only a small set of experts are activated for each task. This prevents the sharing of the entire backbone model between all tasks, which strengthens the model, especially when the training set size and the number of tasks scale up. More interestingly, for each task, we can extract the small set of experts as a standalone model that maintains the same performance as the large model. Extensive experiments on the Taskonomy dataset with 13 vision tasks and the PASCAL-Context dataset with 5 vision tasks show the superiority of our approach. 

### [VolRecon: Volume Rendering of Signed Ray Distance Functions for  Generalizable Multi-View Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08067)
With the success of neural volume rendering in novel view synthesis, neural implicit reconstruction with volume rendering has become popular. However, most methods optimize per-scene functions and are unable to generalize to novel scenes. We introduce VolRecon, a generalizable implicit reconstruction method with Signed Ray Distance Function (SRDF). To reconstruct with fine details and little noise, we combine projection features, aggregated from multi-view features with a view transformer, and volume features interpolated from a coarse global feature volume. A ray transformer computes SRDF values of all the samples along a ray to estimate the surface location, which are used for volume rendering of color and depth. Extensive experiments on DTU and ETH3D demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. On DTU, our method outperforms SparseNeuS by about 30% in sparse view reconstruction and achieves comparable quality as MVSNet in full view reconstruction. Besides, our method shows good generalization ability on the large-scale ETH3D benchmark. Project page: https://fangjinhuawang.github.io/VolRecon. 

### [NeRF-Art: Text-Driven Neural Radiance Fields Stylization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08070)
As a powerful representation of 3D scenes, the neural radiance field (NeRF) enables high-quality novel view synthesis from multi-view images. Stylizing NeRF, however, remains challenging, especially on simulating a text-guided style with both the appearance and the geometry altered simultaneously. In this paper, we present NeRF-Art, a text-guided NeRF stylization approach that manipulates the style of a pre-trained NeRF model with a simple text prompt. Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency. The code and more results can be found in our project page: https://cassiepython.github.io/nerfart/. 

### [Universal Generative Modeling in Dual-domain for Dynamic MR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07599)
Dynamic magnetic resonance image reconstruction from incomplete k-space data has generated great research interest due to its capability to reduce scan time. Never-theless, the reconstruction problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Recently, diffusion models espe-cially score-based generative models have exhibited great potential in algorithm robustness and usage flexi-bility. Moreover, the unified framework through the variance exploding stochastic differential equation (VE-SDE) is proposed to enable new sampling methods and further extend the capabilities of score-based gener-ative models. Therefore, by taking advantage of the uni-fied framework, we proposed a k-space and image Du-al-Domain collaborative Universal Generative Model (DD-UGM) which combines the score-based prior with low-rank regularization penalty to reconstruct highly under-sampled measurements. More precisely, we extract prior components from both image and k-space domains via a universal generative model and adaptively handle these prior components for faster processing while maintaining good generation quality. Experimental comparisons demonstrated the noise reduction and detail preservation abilities of the proposed method. Much more than that, DD-UGM can reconstruct data of differ-ent frames by only training a single frame image, which reflects the flexibility of the proposed model. 

### [Two-stage Contextual Transformer-based Convolutional Neural Network for  Airway Extraction from CT Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07651)
Accurate airway extraction from computed tomography (CT) images is a critical step for planning navigation bronchoscopy and quantitative assessment of airway-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The existing methods are challenging to sufficiently segment the airway, especially the high-generation airway, with the constraint of the limited label and cannot meet the clinical use in COPD. We propose a novel two-stage 3D contextual transformer-based U-Net for airway segmentation using CT images. The method consists of two stages, performing initial and refined airway segmentation. The two-stage model shares the same subnetwork with different airway masks as input. Contextual transformer block is performed both in the encoder and decoder path of the subnetwork to finish high-quality airway segmentation effectively. In the first stage, the total airway mask and CT images are provided to the subnetwork, and the intrapulmonary airway mask and corresponding CT scans to the subnetwork in the second stage. Then the predictions of the two-stage method are merged as the final prediction. Extensive experiments were performed on in-house and multiple public datasets. Quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrate that our proposed method extracted much more branches and lengths of the tree while accomplishing state-of-the-art airway segmentation performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaozsq/airway_segmentation.
