        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Can large language models be trained to produce philosophical texts that are difficult to distinguish from texts produced by human philosophers? To address this question, we fine-tuned OpenAI's GPT-3 with the works of philosopher Daniel C. Dennett as additional training data. To explore the Dennett model, we asked the real Dennett ten philosophical questions and then posed the same questions to the language model, collecting four responses for each question without cherry-picking. We recruited 425 participants to distinguish Dennett's answer from the four machine-generated answers. Experts on Dennett's work (N = 25) succeeded 51% of the time, above the chance rate of 20% but short of our hypothesized rate of 80% correct. For two of the ten questions, the language model produced at least one answer that experts selected more frequently than Dennett's own answer. Philosophy blog readers (N = 302) performed similarly to the experts, while ordinary research participants (N = 98) were near chance distinguishing GPT-3's responses from those of an "actual human philosopher". <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent Transformer-based summarization models have provided a promising approach to abstractive summarization. They go beyond sentence selection and extractive strategies to deal with more complicated tasks such as novel word generation and sentence paraphrasing. Nonetheless, these models have two shortcomings: (1) they often perform poorly in content selection, and (2) their training strategy is not quite efficient, which restricts model performance. In this paper, we explore two orthogonal ways to compensate for these pitfalls. First, we augment the Transformer network with a sentence cross-attention module in the decoder, encouraging more abstraction of salient content. Second, we include a curriculum learning approach to reweight the training samples, bringing about an efficient learning procedure. Our second approach to enhance the training strategy of Transformers networks makes stronger gains as compared to the first approach. We apply our model on extreme summarization dataset of Reddit TIFU posts. We further look into three cross-domain summarization datasets (Webis-TLDR-17, CNN/DM, and XSum), measuring the efficacy of curriculum learning when applied in summarization. Moreover, a human evaluation is conducted to show the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of qualitative criteria, namely, fluency, informativeness, and overall quality. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: ``Effective robustness'' measures the extra out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness beyond what can be predicted from the in-distribution (ID) performance. Existing effective robustness evaluations typically use a single test set such as ImageNet to evaluate ID accuracy. This becomes problematic when evaluating models trained on different data distributions, e.g., comparing models trained on ImageNet vs. zero-shot language-image pre-trained models trained on LAION. In this paper, we propose a new effective robustness evaluation metric to compare the effective robustness of models trained on different data distributions. To do this we control for the accuracy on multiple ID test sets that cover the training distributions for all the evaluated models. Our new evaluation metric provides a better estimate of the effectiveness robustness and explains the surprising effective robustness gains of zero-shot CLIP-like models exhibited when considering only one ID dataset, while the gains diminish under our evaluation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence include diffusion generative models, quite popular tools which can produce original images both unconditionally and, in some cases, conditioned by some inputs provided by the user. Apart from implementation details, which are outside the scope of this work, all of the main models used to generate images are substantially based on a common theory which restores a new image from a completely degraded one. In this work we explain how this is possible by focusing on the mathematical theory behind them, i.e. without analyzing in detail the specific implementations and related methods. The aim of this work is to clarify to the interested reader what all this means mathematically and intuitively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We demonstrate the potential of few-shot translation systems, trained with unpaired language data, for both high and low-resource language pairs. We show that with only 5 examples of high-quality translation data shown at inference, a transformer decoder-only model trained solely with self-supervised learning, is able to match specialized supervised state-of-the-art models as well as more general commercial translation systems. In particular, we outperform the best performing system on the WMT'21 English - Chinese news translation task by only using five examples of English - Chinese parallel data at inference. Moreover, our approach in building these models does not necessitate joint multilingual training or back-translation, is conceptually simple and shows the potential to extend to the multilingual setting. Furthermore, the resulting models are two orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art language models. We then analyze the factors which impact the performance of few-shot translation systems, and highlight that the quality of the few-shot demonstrations heavily determines the quality of the translations generated by our models. Finally, we show that the few-shot paradigm also provides a way to control certain attributes of the translation -- we show that we are able to control for regional varieties and formality using only a five examples at inference, paving the way towards controllable machine translation systems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a highly promising method for mitigating the computational problems of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Among various KD approaches, Intermediate Layer Distillation (ILD) has been a de facto standard KD method with its performance efficacy in the NLP field. In this paper, we find that existing ILD methods are prone to overfitting to training datasets, although these methods transfer more information than the original KD. Next, we present the simple observations to mitigate the overfitting of ILD: distilling only the last Transformer layer and conducting ILD on supplementary tasks. Based on our two findings, we propose a simple yet effective consistency-regularized ILD (CR-ILD), which prevents the student model from overfitting the training dataset. Substantial experiments on distilling BERT on the GLUE benchmark and several synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed ILD method outperforms other KD techniques.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent works in spatiotemporal radiance fields can produce photorealistic free-viewpoint videos. However, they are inherently unsuitable for interactive streaming scenarios (e.g. video conferencing, telepresence) because have an inevitable lag even if the training is instantaneous. This is because these approaches consume videos and thus have to buffer chunks of frames (often seconds) before processing. In this work, we take a step towards interactive streaming via a frame-by-frame approach naturally free of lag. Conventional wisdom believes that per-frame NeRFs are impractical due to prohibitive training costs and storage. We break this belief by introducing Incremental Neural Videos (INV), a per-frame NeRF that is efficiently trained and streamable. We designed INV based on two insights: (1) Our main finding is that MLPs naturally partition themselves into Structure and Color Layers, which store structural and color/texture information respectively. (2) We leverage this property to retain and improve upon knowledge from previous frames, thus amortizing training across frames and reducing redundant learning. As a result, with negligible changes to NeRF, INV can achieve good qualities (&gt;28.6db) in 8min/frame. It can also outperform prior SOTA in 19% less training time. Additionally, our Temporal Weight Compression reduces the per-frame size to 0.3MB/frame (6.6% of NeRF). More importantly, INV is free from buffer lag and is naturally fit for streaming. While this work does not achieve real-time training, it shows that incremental approaches like INV present new possibilities in interactive 3D streaming. Moreover, our discovery of natural information partition leads to a better understanding and manipulation of MLPs. Code and dataset will be released soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: One of the most critical problems in machine learning is HyperParameter Optimization (HPO), since choice of hyperparameters has a significant impact on final model performance. Although there are many HPO algorithms, they either have no theoretical guarantees or require strong assumptions. To this end, we introduce BLiE -- a Lipschitz-bandit-based algorithm for HPO that only assumes Lipschitz continuity of the objective function. BLiE exploits the landscape of the objective function to adaptively search over the hyperparameter space. Theoretically, we show that $(i)$ BLiE finds an $\epsilon$-optimal hyperparameter with $O \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon} \right)^{d_z + \beta}$ total budgets, where $d_z$ and $\beta$ are problem intrinsic; $(ii)$ BLiE is highly parallelizable. Empirically, we demonstrate that BLiE outperforms the state-of-the-art HPO algorithms on benchmark tasks. We also apply BLiE to search for noise schedule of diffusion models. Comparison with the default schedule shows that BLiE schedule greatly improves the sampling speed. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-based image captioning is an important but under-explored task, aiming to generate descriptions containing visual objects and scene text. Recent studies have made encouraging progress, but they are still suffering from a lack of overall understanding of scenes and generating inaccurate captions. One possible reason is that current studies mainly focus on constructing the plane-level geometric relationship of scene text without depth information. This leads to insufficient scene text relational reasoning so that models may describe scene text inaccurately. The other possible reason is that existing methods fail to generate fine-grained descriptions of some visual objects. In addition, they may ignore essential visual objects, leading to the scene text belonging to these ignored objects not being utilized. To address the above issues, we propose a DEpth and VIsual ConcEpts Aware Transformer (DEVICE) for TextCaps. Concretely, to construct three-dimensional geometric relations, we introduce depth information and propose a depth-enhanced feature updating module to ameliorate OCR token features. To generate more precise and comprehensive captions, we introduce semantic features of detected visual object concepts as auxiliary information. Our DEVICE is capable of generalizing scenes more comprehensively and boosting the accuracy of described visual entities. Sufficient experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEVICE, which outperforms state-of-the-art models on the TextCaps test set. Our code will be publicly available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multi-resolution hash encoding has recently been proposed to reduce the computational cost of neural renderings, such as NeRF. This method requires accurate camera poses for the neural renderings of given scenes. However, contrary to previous methods jointly optimizing camera poses and 3D scenes, the naive gradient-based camera pose refinement method using multi-resolution hash encoding severely deteriorates performance. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to calibrate the camera pose and learn a geometric representation using efficient multi-resolution hash encoding. Showing that the oscillating gradient flows of hash encoding interfere with the registration of camera poses, our method addresses the issue by utilizing smooth interpolation weighting to stabilize the gradient oscillation for the ray samplings across hash grids. Moreover, the curriculum training procedure helps to learn the level-wise hash encoding, further increasing the pose refinement. Experiments on the novel-view synthesis datasets validate that our learning frameworks achieve state-of-the-art performance and rapid convergence of neural rendering, even when initial camera poses are unknown. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recently 3D-aware GAN methods with neural radiance field have developed rapidly. However, current methods model the whole image as an overall neural radiance field, which limits the partial semantic editability of synthetic results. Since NeRF renders an image pixel by pixel, it is possible to split NeRF in the spatial dimension. We propose a Compositional Neural Radiance Field (CNeRF) for semantic 3D-aware portrait synthesis and manipulation. CNeRF divides the image by semantic regions and learns an independent neural radiance field for each region, and finally fuses them and renders the complete image. Thus we can manipulate the synthesized semantic regions independently, while fixing the other parts unchanged. Furthermore, CNeRF is also designed to decouple shape and texture within each semantic region. Compared to state-of-the-art 3D-aware GAN methods, our approach enables fine-grained semantic region manipulation, while maintaining high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis. The ablation studies show the effectiveness of the structure and loss function used by our method. In addition real image inversion and cartoon portrait 3D editing experiments demonstrate the application potential of our method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Pretrained language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, BERT has been adapted to the biomedical domain. Despite the effectiveness, these models have hundreds of millions of parameters and are computationally expensive when applied to large-scale NLP applications. We hypothesized that the number of parameters of the original BERT can be dramatically reduced with minor impact on performance. In this study, we present Bioformer, a compact BERT model for biomedical text mining. We pretrained two Bioformer models (named Bioformer8L and Bioformer16L) which reduced the model size by 60% compared to BERTBase. Bioformer uses a biomedical vocabulary and was pre-trained from scratch on PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central full-text articles. We thoroughly evaluated the performance of Bioformer as well as existing biomedical BERT models including BioBERT and PubMedBERT on 15 benchmark datasets of four different biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering and document classification. The results show that with 60% fewer parameters, Bioformer16L is only 0.1% less accurate than PubMedBERT while Bioformer8L is 0.9% less accurate than PubMedBERT. Both Bioformer16L and Bioformer8L outperformed BioBERTBase-v1.1. In addition, Bioformer16L and Bioformer8L are 2-3 fold as fast as PubMedBERT/BioBERTBase-v1.1. Bioformer has been successfully deployed to PubTator Central providing gene annotations over 35 million PubMed abstracts and 5 million PubMed Central full-text articles. We make Bioformer publicly available via https://github.com/WGLab/bioformer, including pre-trained models, datasets, and instructions for downstream use. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Exemplar-based image translation refers to the task of generating images with the desired style, while conditioning on certain input image. Most of the current methods learn the correspondence between two input domains and lack the mining of information within the domains. In this paper, we propose a more general learning approach by considering two domain features as a whole and learning both inter-domain correspondence and intra-domain potential information interactions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-domain Feature Fusion Transformer (CFFT) to learn inter- and intra-domain feature fusion. Based on CFFT, the proposed CFFT-GAN works well on exemplar-based image translation. Moreover, CFFT-GAN is able to decouple and fuse features from multiple domains by cascading CFFT modules. We conduct rich quantitative and qualitative experiments on several image translation tasks, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies show the importance of our proposed CFFT. Application experimental results reflect the potential of our method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent deep learning methods have achieved promising results in image shadow removal. However, most of the existing approaches focus on working locally within shadow and non-shadow regions, resulting in severe artifacts around the shadow boundaries as well as inconsistent illumination between shadow and non-shadow regions. It is still challenging for the deep shadow removal model to exploit the global contextual correlation between shadow and non-shadow regions. In this work, we first propose a Retinex-based shadow model, from which we derive a novel transformer-based network, dubbed ShandowFormer, to exploit non-shadow regions to help shadow region restoration. A multi-scale channel attention framework is employed to hierarchically capture the global information. Based on that, we propose a Shadow-Interaction Module (SIM) with Shadow-Interaction Attention (SIA) in the bottleneck stage to effectively model the context correlation between shadow and non-shadow regions. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular public datasets, including ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD, to evaluate the proposed method. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by using up to 150X fewer model parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Most existing LPR methods use mundane representations of the input point cloud without considering different views, which may not fully exploit the information from LiDAR sensors. In this paper, we propose a cross-view transformer-based network, dubbed CVTNet, to fuse the range image views (RIVs) and bird's eye views (BEVs) generated from the LiDAR data. It extracts correlations within the views themselves using intra-transformers and between the two different views using inter-transformers. Based on that, our proposed CVTNet generates a yaw-angle-invariant global descriptor for each laser scan end-to-end online and retrieves previously seen places by descriptor matching between the current query scan and the pre-built database. We evaluate our approach on three datasets collected with different sensor setups and environmental conditions. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LPR methods with strong robustness to viewpoint changes and long-time spans. Furthermore, our approach has a good real-time performance that can run faster than the typical LiDAR frame rate. The implementation of our method is released as open source at: https://github.com/BIT-MJY/CVTNet. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in tabular data synthesis, under the presumption of direct accessible training data. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a paradigm which allows to distributedly train machine learning model with clients possessing unique features pertaining to the same individuals, where the tabular data learning is the primary use case. However, it is unknown if tabular GANs can be learned in VFL. Demand for secure data transfer among clients and GAN during training and data synthesizing poses extra challenge. Conditional vector for tabular GANs is a valuable tool to control specific features of generated data. But it contains sensitive information from real data - risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose GTV, a VFL framework for tabular GANs, whose key components are generator, discriminator and the conditional vector. GTV proposes an unique distributed training architecture for generator and discriminator to access training data in a privacy-preserving manner. To accommodate conditional vector into training without privacy leakage, GTV designs a mechanism training-with-shuffling to ensure that no party can reconstruct training data with conditional vector. We evaluate the effectiveness of GTV in terms of synthetic data quality, and overall training scalability. Results show that GTV can consistently generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data of comparable quality to that generated by centralized GAN algorithm. The difference on machine learning utility can be as low as to 2.7%, even under extremely imbalanced data distributions across clients and different number of clients. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: It is a known problem that deep-learning-based end-to-end (E2E) channel coding systems depend on a known and differentiable channel model, due to the learning process and based on the gradient-descent optimization methods. This places the challenge to approximate or generate the channel or its derivative from samples generated by pilot signaling in real-world scenarios. Currently, there are two prevalent methods to solve this problem. One is to generate the channel via a generative adversarial network (GAN), and the other is to, in essence, approximate the gradient via reinforcement learning methods. Other methods include using score-based methods, variational autoencoders, or mutual-information-based methods. In this paper, we focus on generative models and, in particular, on a new promising method called diffusion models, which have shown a higher quality of generation in image-based tasks. We will show that diffusion models can be used in wireless E2E scenarios and that they work as good as Wasserstein GANs while having a more stable training procedure and a better generalization ability in testing. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we present TEXTure, a novel method for text-guided generation, editing, and transfer of textures for 3D shapes. Leveraging a pretrained depth-to-image diffusion model, TEXTure applies an iterative scheme that paints a 3D model from different viewpoints. Yet, while depth-to-image models can create plausible textures from a single viewpoint, the stochastic nature of the generation process can cause many inconsistencies when texturing an entire 3D object. To tackle these problems, we dynamically define a trimap partitioning of the rendered image into three progression states, and present a novel elaborated diffusion sampling process that uses this trimap representation to generate seamless textures from different views. We then show that one can transfer the generated texture maps to new 3D geometries without requiring explicit surface-to-surface mapping, as well as extract semantic textures from a set of images without requiring any explicit reconstruction. Finally, we show that TEXTure can be used to not only generate new textures but also edit and refine existing textures using either a text prompt or user-provided scribbles. We demonstrate that our TEXTuring method excels at generating, transferring, and editing textures through extensive evaluation, and further close the gap between 2D image generation and 3D texturing. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are known for their strong abilities on capturing the underlying distribution of training instances. Since the seminal work of GAN, many variants of GAN have been proposed. However, existing GANs are almost established on the assumption that the training dataset is clean. But in many real-world applications, this may not hold, that is, the training dataset may be contaminated by a proportion of undesired instances. When training on such datasets, existing GANs will learn a mixture distribution of desired and contaminated instances, rather than the desired distribution of desired data only (target distribution). To learn the target distribution from contaminated datasets, two purified generative adversarial networks (PuriGAN) are developed, in which the discriminators are augmented with the capability to distinguish between target and contaminated instances by leveraging an extra dataset solely composed of contamination instances. We prove that under some mild conditions, the proposed PuriGANs are guaranteed to converge to the distribution of desired instances. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed PuriGANs are able to generate much better images from the desired distribution than comparable baselines when trained on contaminated datasets. In addition, we also demonstrate the usefulness of PuriGAN on downstream applications by applying it to the tasks of semi-supervised anomaly detection on contaminated datasets and PU-learning. Experimental results show that PuriGAN is able to deliver the best performance over comparable baselines on both tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As a de facto solution, the vanilla Vision Transformers (ViTs) are encouraged to model long-range dependencies between arbitrary image patches while the global attended receptive field leads to quadratic computational cost. Another branch of Vision Transformers exploits local attention inspired by CNNs, which only models the interactions between patches in small neighborhoods. Although such a solution reduces the computational cost, it naturally suffers from small attended receptive fields, which may limit the performance. In this work, we explore effective Vision Transformers to pursue a preferable trade-off between the computational complexity and size of the attended receptive field. By analyzing the patch interaction of global attention in ViTs, we observe two key properties in the shallow layers, namely locality and sparsity, indicating the redundancy of global dependency modeling in shallow layers of ViTs. Accordingly, we propose Multi-Scale Dilated Attention (MSDA) to model local and sparse patch interaction within the sliding window. With a pyramid architecture, we construct a Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer (DilateFormer) by stacking MSDA blocks at low-level stages and global multi-head self-attention blocks at high-level stages. Our experiment results show that our DilateFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks. On ImageNet-1K classification task, DilateFormer achieves comparable performance with 70% fewer FLOPs compared with existing state-of-the-art models. Our DilateFormer-Base achieves 85.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification task, 53.5% box mAP/46.1% mask mAP on COCO object detection/instance segmentation task and 51.1% MS mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation task. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human pose estimation is a complicated structured data sequence modeling task. Most existing methods only consider the pair-wise interaction of human body joints in model learning. Unfortunately, this causes 3D pose estimation to fail in difficult cases such as $\textit{joints overlapping}$, and pose $\textit{fast-changing}$, as pair-wise relations cannot exploit fine-grained human body priors in pose estimation. To this end, we revamped the 3D pose estimation framework with a $\textit{High-order}$ $\textit{Directed}$ $\textit{Transformer}$ (HDFormer), which coherently exploits the high-order bones and joints relevances to boost the performance of pose estimation. Specifically, HDFormer adopts both self-attention and high-order attention schemes to build up a multi-order attention module to perform the information flow interaction including the first-order $"\textit{joint$\leftrightarrow$joint}"$, second-order $"\textit{bone$\leftrightarrow$joint}"$ as well as high-order $"\textit{hyperbone$\leftrightarrow$joint}"$ relationships (hyperbone is defined as a joint set), compensating the hard cases prediction in fast-changing and heavy occlusion scenarios. Moreover, modernized CNN techniques are applied to upgrade the transformer-based architecture to speed up the HDFormer, achieving a favorable trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. We compare our model with other SOTA models on the datasets Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed HDFormer achieves superior performance with only $\textbf{1/10}$ parameters and much lower computational cost compared to the current SOTAs. Moreover, HDFormer can be applied to various types of real-world applications, enabling real-time and accurate 3D pose estimation.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We argue that all building blocks of transformer models can be expressed with a single concept: combinatorial Hopf algebra. Transformer learning emerges as a result of the subtle interplay between the algebraic and coalgebraic operations of the combinatorial Hopf algebra. Viewed through this lens, the transformer model becomes a linear time-invariant system where the attention mechanism computes a generalized convolution transform and the residual stream serves as a unit impulse. Attention-only transformers then learn by enforcing an invariant between these two paths. We call this invariant Hopf coherence. Due to this, with a degree of poetic license, one could call combinatorial Hopf algebras "tensors with a built-in loss function gradient". This loss function gradient occurs within the single layers and no backward pass is needed. This is in contrast to automatic differentiation which happens across the whole graph and needs a explicit backward pass. This property is the result of the fact that combinatorial Hopf algebras have the surprising property of calculating eigenvalues by repeated squaring. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Investigating new methods of creating face morphing attacks is essential to foresee novel attacks and help mitigate them. Creating morphing attacks is commonly either performed on the image-level or on the representation-level. The representation-level morphing has been performed so far based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) where the encoded images are interpolated in the latent space to produce a morphed image based on the interpolated vector. Such a process was constrained by the limited reconstruction fidelity of GAN architectures. Recent advances in the diffusion autoencoder models have overcome the GAN limitations, leading to high reconstruction fidelity. This theoretically makes them a perfect candidate to perform representation-level face morphing. This work investigates using diffusion autoencoders to create face morphing attacks by comparing them to a wide range of image-level and representation-level morphs. Our vulnerability analyses on four state-of-the-art face recognition models have shown that such models are highly vulnerable to the created attacks, the MorDIFF, especially when compared to existing representation-level morphs. Detailed detectability analyses are also performed on the MorDIFF, showing that they are as challenging to detect as other morphing attacks created on the image- or representation-level. Data and morphing script are made public. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have demonstrated their powerful generative capability in many tasks, with great potential to serve as a paradigm for offline reinforcement learning. However, the quality of the diffusion model is limited by the insufficient diversity of training data, which hinders the performance of planning and the generalizability to new tasks. This paper introduces AdaptDiffuser, an evolutionary planning method with diffusion that can self-evolve to improve the diffusion model hence a better planner, not only for seen tasks but can also adapt to unseen tasks. AdaptDiffuser enables the generation of rich synthetic expert data for goal-conditioned tasks using guidance from reward gradients. It then selects high-quality data via a discriminator to finetune the diffusion model, which improves the generalization ability to unseen tasks. Empirical experiments on two benchmark environments and two carefully designed unseen tasks in KUKA industrial robot arm and Maze2D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptDiffuser. For example, AdaptDiffuser not only outperforms the previous art Diffuser by 20.8% on Maze2D and 7.5% on MuJoCo locomotion, but also adapts better to new tasks, e.g., KUKA pick-and-place, by 27.9% without requiring additional expert data. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
