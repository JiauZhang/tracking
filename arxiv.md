        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Acute ischaemic stroke, caused by an interruption in blood flow to brain tissue, is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. The selection of patients for the most optimal ischaemic stroke treatment is a crucial step for a successful outcome, as the effect of treatment highly depends on the time to treatment. We propose a transformer-based multimodal network (TranSOP) for a classification approach that employs clinical metadata and imaging information, acquired on hospital admission, to predict the functional outcome of stroke treatment based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). This includes a fusion module to efficiently combine 3D non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) features and clinical information. In comparative experiments using unimodal and multimodal data on the MRCLEAN dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art AUC score of 0.85. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While CNN-based methods have been the cornerstone of medical image segmentation due to their promising performance and robustness, they suffer from limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based approaches are currently prevailing since they enlarge the reception field to model global contextual correlation. To further extract rich representations, some extensions of the U-Net employ multi-scale feature extraction and fusion modules and obtain improved performance. Inspired by this idea, we propose TransCeption for medical image segmentation, a pure transformer-based U-shape network featured by incorporating the inception-like module into the encoder and adopting a contextual bridge for better feature fusion. The design proposed in this work is based on three core principles: (1) The patch merging module in the encoder is redesigned with ResInception Patch Merging (RIPM). Multi-branch transformer (MB transformer) adopts the same number of branches as the outputs of RIPM. Combining the two modules enables the model to capture a multi-scale representation within a single stage. (2) We construct an Intra-stage Feature Fusion (IFF) module following the MB transformer to enhance the aggregation of feature maps from all the branches and particularly focus on the interaction between the different channels of all the scales. (3) In contrast to a bridge that only contains token-wise self-attention, we propose a Dual Transformer Bridge that also includes channel-wise self-attention to exploit correlations between scales at different stages from a dual perspective. Extensive experiments on multi-organ and skin lesion segmentation tasks present the superior performance of TransCeption compared to previous work.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Our work advances an approach for predicting hate speech in social media, drawing out the critical need to consider the discussions that follow a post to successfully detect when hateful discourse may arise. Using graph transformer networks, coupled with modelling attention and BERT-level natural language processing, our approach can capture context and anticipate upcoming anti-social behaviour. In this paper, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis of this solution for hate speech detection in social networks, leading to insights into where the method has the most impressive outcomes in comparison with competitors and identifying scenarios where there are challenges to achieving ideal performance. Included is an exploration of the kinds of posts that permeate social media today, including the use of hateful images. This suggests avenues for extending our model to be more comprehensive. A key insight is that the focus on reasoning about the concept of context positions us well to be able to support multi-modal analysis of online posts. We conclude with a reflection on how the problem we are addressing relates especially well to the theme of dynamic change, a critical concern for all AI solutions for social impact. We also comment briefly on how mental health well-being can be advanced with our work, through curated content attuned to the extent of hate in posts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Entities and events have long been regarded as the crux of machine reasoning. Specifically, procedural texts have received increasing attention due to the dynamic nature of involved entities and events. Existing work has exclusively focused on entity state tracking (e.g., the temperature of a pan) or counterfactual event reasoning (e.g., how likely am I to burn myself by touching the pan), while these two tasks are tightly intertwined. In this work, we propose CREPE, the first benchmark on causal reasoning about event plausibility based on entity states. We experiment with strong large language models and show that most models including GPT3 perform close to chance of .30 F1, lagging far behind the human performance of .87 F1. Inspired by the finding that structured representations such as programming languages benefits event reasoning as a prompt to code language models such as Codex, we creatively inject the causal relations between entities and events through intermediate variables and boost the performance to .67 to .72 F1. Our proposed event representation not only allows for knowledge injection, but also marks the first successful attempt of chain-of-thought reasoning with code language models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-based style transfer is a newly-emerging research topic that uses text information instead of style image to guide the transfer process, significantly extending the application scenario of style transfer. However, previous methods require extra time for optimization or text-image paired data, leading to limited effectiveness. In this work, we achieve a data-efficient text-based style transfer method that does not require optimization at the inference stage. Specifically, we convert text input to the style space of the pre-trained VGG network to realize a more effective style swap. We also leverage CLIP's multi-modal embedding space to learn the text-to-style mapping with the image dataset only. Our method can transfer arbitrary new styles of text input in real-time and synthesize high-quality artistic images. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer framework has been showing superior performances in visual object tracking for its great strength in information aggregation across the template and search image with the well-known attention mechanism. Most recent advances focus on exploring attention mechanism variants for better information aggregation. We find these schemes are equivalent to or even just a subset of the basic self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we prove that the vanilla self-attention structure is sufficient for information aggregation, and structural adaption is unnecessary. The key is not the attention structure, but how to extract the discriminative feature for tracking and enhance the communication between the target and search image. Based on this finding, we adopt the basic vision transformer (ViT) architecture as our main tracker and concatenate the template and search image for feature embedding. To guide the encoder to capture the invariant feature for tracking, we attach a lightweight correlative masked decoder which reconstructs the original template and search image from the corresponding masked tokens. The correlative masked decoder serves as a plugin for the compact transform tracker and is skipped in inference. Our compact tracker uses the most simple structure which only consists of a ViT backbone and a box head, and can run at 40 fps. Extensive experiments show the proposed compact transform tracker outperforms existing approaches, including advanced attention variants, and demonstrates the sufficiency of self-attention in tracking tasks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging datasets, along with the VOT2020, UAV123, LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k benchmarks.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a novel framework to regularize Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in a few-shot setting with a geometry-aware consistency regularization. The proposed approach leverages a rendered depth map at unobserved viewpoint to warp sparse input images to the unobserved viewpoint and impose them as pseudo ground truths to facilitate learning of NeRF. By encouraging such geometry-aware consistency at a feature-level instead of using pixel-level reconstruction loss, we regularize the NeRF at semantic and structural levels while allowing for modeling view dependent radiance to account for color variations across viewpoints. We also propose an effective method to filter out erroneous warped solutions, along with training strategies to stabilize training during optimization. We show that our model achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF models.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Concurrent programs suffer from data races. To prevent data races, programmers use locks. However, programs can eliminate data races only when they acquire and release correct locks at correct timing. The lock API of C, in which people have developed a large portion of legacy system programs, does not validate the correct use of locks. On the other hand, Rust, a recently developed system programming language, provides a lock API that guarantees the correct use of locks via type checking. This makes rewriting legacy system programs in Rust a promising way to retrofit safety into them. Unfortunately, manual C-to-Rust translation is extremely laborious due to the discrepancies between their lock APIs. Even the state-of-the-art automatic C-to-Rust translator retains the C lock API, expecting developers to replace them with the Rust lock API. In this work, we propose an automatic tool to replace the C lock API with the Rust lock API. It facilitates C-to-Rust translation of concurrent programs with less human effort than the current practice. Our tool consists of a Rust code transformer that takes a lock summary as an input and a static analyzer that efficiently generates precise lock summaries. We show that the transformer is scalable and widely applicable while preserving the semantics; it transforms 66 KLOC in 2.6 seconds and successfully handles 74% of real-world programs. We also show that the analyzer is scalable and precise; it analyzes 66 KLOC in 4.3 seconds. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <span style="font-size: 12px; visibility: visible;">
        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We empirically study the effect of noise scheduling strategies for denoising diffusion generative models. There are three findings: (1) the noise scheduling is crucial for the performance, and the optimal one depends on the task (e.g., image sizes), (2) when increasing the image size, the optimal noise scheduling shifts towards a noisier one (due to increased redundancy in pixels), and (3) simply scaling the input data by a factor of $b$ while keeping the noise schedule function fixed (equivalent to shifting the logSNR by $\log b$) is a good strategy across image sizes. This simple recipe, when combined with recently proposed Recurrent Interface Network (RIN), yields state-of-the-art pixel-based diffusion models for high-resolution images on ImageNet, enabling single-stage, end-to-end generation of diverse and high-fidelity images at 1024$\times$1024 resolution for the first time (without upsampling/cascades). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Saliency Prediction aims to predict the attention distribution of human eyes given an RGB image. Most of the recent state-of-the-art methods are based on deep image feature representations from traditional CNNs. However, the traditional convolution could not capture the global features of the image well due to its small kernel size. Besides, the high-level factors which closely correlate to human visual perception, e.g., objects, color, light, etc., are not considered. Inspired by these, we propose a Transformer-based method with semantic segmentation as another learning objective. More global cues of the image could be captured by Transformer. In addition, simultaneously learning the object segmentation simulates the human visual perception, which we would verify in our investigation of human gaze control in cognitive science. We build an extra decoder for the subtask and the multiple tasks share the same Transformer encoder, forcing it to learn from multiple feature spaces. We find in practice simply adding the subtask might confuse the main task learning, hence Multi-task Attention Module is proposed to deal with the feature interaction between the multiple learning targets. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The enormous growth of research publications has made it challenging for academic search engines to bring the most relevant papers against the given search query. Numerous solutions have been proposed over the years to improve the effectiveness of academic search, including exploiting query expansion and citation analysis. Query expansion techniques mitigate the mismatch between the language used in a query and indexed documents. However, these techniques can suffer from introducing non-relevant information while expanding the original query. Recently, contextualized model BERT to document retrieval has been quite successful in query expansion. Motivated by such issues and inspired by the success of BERT, this paper proposes a novel approach called QeBERT. QeBERT exploits BERT-based embedding and Citation Network Analysis (CNA) in query expansion for improving scholarly search. Specifically, we use the context-aware BERT-embedding and CNA for query expansion in Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) fash-ion. Initial experimental results on the ACL dataset show that BERT-embedding can provide a valuable augmentation to query expansion and improve search relevance when combined with CNA. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We explore the extent to which zero-shot vision-language models exhibit gender bias for different vision tasks. Vision models traditionally required task-specific labels for representing concepts, as well as finetuning; zero-shot models like CLIP instead perform tasks with an open-vocabulary, meaning they do not need a fixed set of labels, by using text embeddings to represent concepts. With these capabilities in mind, we ask: Do vision-language models exhibit gender bias when performing zero-shot image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation? We evaluate different vision-language models with multiple datasets across a set of concepts and find (i) all models evaluated show distinct performance differences based on the perceived gender of the person co-occurring with a given concept in the image and that aggregating analyses over all concepts can mask these concerns; (ii) model calibration (i.e. the relationship between accuracy and confidence) also differs distinctly by perceived gender, even when evaluating on similar representations of concepts; and (iii) these observed disparities align with existing gender biases in word embeddings from language models. These findings suggest that, while language greatly expands the capability of vision tasks, it can also contribute to social biases in zero-shot vision settings. Furthermore, biases can further propagate when foundational models like CLIP are used by other models to enable zero-shot capabilities. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We aim to diagnose the potential biases in image classifiers. To this end, prior works manually labeled biased attributes or visualized biased features, which need high annotation costs or are often ambiguous to interpret. Instead, we leverage two types (generative and discriminative) of pre-trained vision-language models to describe the visual bias as a word. Specifically, we propose bias-to-text (B2T), which generates captions of the mispredicted images using a pre-trained captioning model to extract the common keywords that may describe visual biases. Then, we categorize the bias type as spurious correlation or majority bias by checking if it is specific or agnostic to the class, based on the similarity of class-wise mispredicted images and the keyword upon a pre-trained vision-language joint embedding space, e.g., CLIP. We demonstrate that the proposed simple and intuitive scheme can recover well-known gender and background biases, and discover novel ones in real-world datasets. Moreover, we utilize B2T to compare the classifiers using different architectures or training methods. Finally, we show that one can obtain debiased classifiers using the B2T bias keywords and CLIP, in both zero-shot and full-shot manners, without using any human annotation on the bias. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper attempts to present the stochastic differential equations of diffusion models in a manner that is accessible to a broad audience. The diffusion process is defined over a population density in R^d. Of particular interest is a population of images. In a diffusion model one first defines a diffusion process that takes a sample from the population and gradually adds noise until only noise remains. The fundamental idea is to sample from the population by a reverse-diffusion process mapping pure noise to a population sample. The diffusion process is defined independent of any ``interpretation'' but can be analyzed using the mathematics of variational auto-encoders (the ``VAE interpretation'') or the Fokker-Planck equation (the ``score-matching intgerpretation''). Both analyses yield reverse-diffusion methods involving the score function. The Fokker-Planck analysis yields a family of reverse-diffusion SDEs parameterized by any desired level of reverse-diffusion noise including zero (deterministic reverse-diffusion). The VAE analysis yields the reverse-diffusion SDE at the same noise level as the diffusion SDE. The VAE analysis also yields a useful expression for computing the population probabilities of a given point (image). This formula for the probability of a given point does not seem to follow naturally from the Fokker-Planck analysis. Much, but apparently not all, of the mathematics presented here can be found in the literature. Attributions are given at the end of the paper. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image-text pretrained models, e.g., CLIP, have shown impressive general multi-modal knowledge learned from large-scale image-text data pairs, thus attracting increasing attention for their potential to improve visual representation learning in the video domain. In this paper, based on the CLIP model, we revisit temporal modeling in the context of image-to-video knowledge transferring, which is the key point for extending image-text pretrained models to the video domain. We find that current temporal modeling mechanisms are tailored to either high-level semantic-dominant tasks (e.g., retrieval) or low-level visual pattern-dominant tasks (e.g., recognition), and fail to work on the two cases simultaneously. The key difficulty lies in modeling temporal dependency while taking advantage of both high-level and low-level knowledge in CLIP model. To tackle this problem, we present Spatial-Temporal Auxiliary Network (STAN) -- a simple and effective temporal modeling mechanism extending CLIP model to diverse video tasks. Specifically, to realize both low-level and high-level knowledge transferring, STAN adopts a branch structure with decomposed spatial-temporal modules that enable multi-level CLIP features to be spatial-temporally contextualized. We evaluate our method on two representative video tasks: Video-Text Retrieval and Video Recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, MSVD, Kinetics-400, and Something-Something-V2.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Toxic comment detection on social media has proven to be essential for content moderation. This paper compares a wide set of different models on a highly skewed multi-label hate speech dataset. We consider inference time and several metrics to measure performance and bias in our comparison. We show that all BERTs have similar performance regardless of the size, optimizations or language used to pre-train the models. RNNs are much faster at inference than any of the BERT. BiLSTM remains a good compromise between performance and inference time. RoBERTa with Focal Loss offers the best performance on biases and AUROC. However, DistilBERT combines both good AUROC and a low inference time. All models are affected by the bias of associating identities. BERT, RNN, and XLNet are less sensitive than the CNN and Compact Convolutional Transformers. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generalizing the fluid dynamical optimal mass transport (OMT) approach of Benamou and Brenier, regularized optimal mass transport (rOMT) formulates a transport problem from an initial mass configuration to another with the optimality defined by the kinetic energy, but subject to an advection-diffusion constraint equation. Both rOMT and the Benamou and Brenier's formulation require the total initial and final mass to be equal; mass is preserved during the entire transport process. However, for many applications, e.g., in dynamic image tracking, this constraint is rarely if ever satisfied. Here we introduce an unbalanced version of rOMT to remove this constraint together with a detailed numerical solution procedure and applications to dynamic image tracking in the brain. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Machine learning and deep learning play vital roles in predicting diseases in the medical field. Machine learning algorithms are widely classified as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. This paper contains a detailed description of our experimental research work in that we used a supervised machine-learning algorithm to build our model for outbreaks of the novel Coronavirus that has spread over the whole world and caused many deaths, which is one of the most disastrous Pandemics in the history of the world. The people suffered physically and economically to survive in this lockdown. This work aims to understand better how machine learning, ensemble, and deep learning models work and are implemented in the real dataset. In our work, we are going to analyze the current trend or pattern of the coronavirus and then predict the further future of the covid-19 confirmed cases or new cases by training the past Covid-19 dataset by using the machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, K-nearest neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random forest algorithm are used to train the model. The decision tree and the Random Forest algorithm perform better than SVR in this work. The performance of SVR and lasso regression are low in all prediction areas Because the SVR is challenging to separate the data using the hyperplane for this type of problem. So SVR mostly gives a lower performance in this problem. Ensemble (Voting, Bagging, and Stacking) and deep learning models(ANN) also predict well. After the prediction, we evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. This work aims to find the trend/pattern of the covid-19. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present MAV3D (Make-A-Video3D), a method for generating three-dimensional dynamic scenes from text descriptions. Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The fluency and factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) heightens the need for corresponding systems to detect whether a piece of text is machine-written. For example, students may use LLMs to complete written assignments, leaving instructors unable to accurately assess student learning. In this paper, we first demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g, T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Identifying and exploring emerging trends in the news is becoming more essential than ever with many changes occurring worldwide due to the global health crises. However, most of the recent research has focused mainly on detecting trends in social media, thus, benefiting from social features (e.g. likes and retweets on Twitter) which helped the task as they can be used to measure the engagement and diffusion rate of content. Yet, formal text data, unlike short social media posts, comes with a longer, less restricted writing format, and thus, more challenging. In this paper, we focus our study on emerging trends detection in financial news articles about Microsoft, collected before and during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2019 to July 2020). We make the dataset accessible and propose a strong baseline (Contextual Leap2Trend) for exploring the dynamics of similarities between pairs of keywords based on topic modelling and term frequency. Finally, we evaluate against a gold standard (Google Trends) and present noteworthy real-world scenarios regarding the influence of the pandemic on Microsoft. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Lossy image compression aims to represent images in as few bits as possible while maintaining fidelity to the original. Theoretical results indicate that optimizing distortion metrics such as PSNR or MS-SSIM necessarily leads to a discrepancy in the statistics of original images from those of reconstructions, in particular at low bitrates, often manifested by the blurring of the compressed images. Previous work has leveraged adversarial discriminators to improve statistical fidelity. Yet these binary discriminators adopted from generative modeling tasks may not be ideal for image compression. In this paper, we introduce a non-binary discriminator that is conditioned on quantized local image representations obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders. Our evaluations on the CLIC2020, DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our discriminator is more effective for jointly optimizing distortion (e.g., PSNR) and statistical fidelity (e.g., FID) than the state-of-the-art HiFiC model. On the CLIC2020 test set, we obtain the same FID as HiFiC with 30-40% fewer bits. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent developments using End-to-End Deep Learning models have been shown to have near or better performance than state of the art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on Automatic Speech Recognition tasks. These models tend to be lighter weight and require less training time than traditional RNN-based approaches. However, these models take frequentist approach to weight training. In theory, network weights are drawn from a latent, intractable probability distribution. We introduce BayesSpeech for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition. BayesSpeech is a Bayesian Transformer Network where these intractable posteriors are learned through variational inference and the local reparameterization trick without recurrence. We show how the introduction of variance in the weights leads to faster training time and near state-of-the-art performance on LibriSpeech-960. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
