        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Given the prevalence of 3D medical imaging technologies such as MRI and CT that are widely used in diagnosing and treating diverse diseases, 3D segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks of medical image analysis. Recently, Transformer-based models have started to achieve state-of-the-art performances across many vision tasks, through pre-training on large-scale natural image benchmark datasets. While works on medical image analysis have also begun to explore Transformer-based models, there is currently no optimal strategy to effectively leverage pre-trained Transformers, primarily due to the difference in dimensionality between 2D natural images and 3D medical images. Existing solutions either split 3D images into 2D slices and predict each slice independently, thereby losing crucial depth-wise information, or modify the Transformer architecture to support 3D inputs without leveraging pre-trained weights. In this work, we use a simple yet effective weight inflation strategy to adapt pre-trained Transformers from 2D to 3D, retaining the benefit of both transfer learning and depth information. We further investigate the effectiveness of transfer from different pre-training sources and objectives. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances across a broad range of 3D medical image datasets, and can become a standard strategy easily utilized by all work on Transformer-based models for 3D medical images, to maximize performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have recently achieved great success in synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, sampling speed and memory constraints remain a major barrier to the practical adoption of diffusion models as the generation process for these models can be slow due to the need for iterative noise estimation using complex neural networks. We propose a solution to this problem by compressing the noise estimation network to accelerate the generation process using post-training quantization (PTQ). While existing PTQ approaches have not been able to effectively deal with the changing output distributions of noise estimation networks in diffusion models over multiple time steps, we are able to formulate a PTQ method that is specifically designed to handle the unique multi-timestep structure of diffusion models with a data calibration scheme using data sampled from different time steps. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to directly quantize full-precision diffusion models into 8-bit or 4-bit models while maintaining comparable performance in a training-free manner, achieving a FID change of at most 1.88. Our approach can also be applied to text-guided image generation, and for the first time we can run stable diffusion in 4-bit weights without losing much perceptual quality, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 9. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently taken the field of generative modeling by storm, pioneering new state-of-the-art results in disciplines such as computer vision and computational biology for diverse tasks ranging from text-guided image generation to structure-guided protein design. Along this latter line of research, methods such as those of Hoogeboom et al. 2022 have been proposed for unconditionally generating 3D molecules using equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) within a DDPM framework. Toward this end, we propose GCDM, a geometry-complete diffusion model that achieves new state-of-the-art results for 3D molecule diffusion generation by leveraging the representation learning strengths offered by GNNs that perform geometry-complete message-passing. Our results with GCDM also offer preliminary insights into how physical inductive biases impact the generative dynamics of molecular DDPMs. The source code, data, and instructions to train new models or reproduce our results are freely available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/bio-diffusion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on education has been a topic of growing concern in recent years. The new generation AI systems such as chatbots have become more accessible on the Internet and stronger in terms of capabilities. The use of chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, for generating academic essays at schools and colleges has sparked fears among scholars. This study aims to explore the originality of contents produced by one of the most popular AI chatbots, ChatGPT. To this end, two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of 50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover, ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI technology on education. Further implications are discussed in the paper. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Due to patient privacy protection concerns, machine learning research in healthcare has been undeniably slower and limited than in other application domains. High-quality, realistic, synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) can be leveraged to accelerate methodological developments for research purposes while mitigating privacy concerns associated with data sharing. The current state-of-the-art model for synthetic EHR generation is generative adversarial networks, which are notoriously difficult to train and can suffer from mode collapse. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, a class of generative models inspired by statistical thermodynamics, have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic samples in certain domains. It is unknown whether these can generalize to generation of large-scale, high-dimensional EHRs. In this paper, we present a novel generative model based on diffusion models that is the first successful application on electronic health records. Our model proposes a mechanism to perform class-conditional sampling to preserve label information. We also introduce a new sampling strategy to accelerate the inference speed. We empirically show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art synthetic EHR generation methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As transformer architectures become increasingly prevalent in computer vision, it is critical to understand their fairness implications. We perform the first study of the fairness of transformers applied to computer vision and benchmark several bias mitigation approaches from prior work. We visualize the feature space of the transformer self-attention modules and discover that a significant portion of the bias is encoded in the query matrix. With this knowledge, we propose TADeT, a targeted alignment strategy for debiasing transformers that aims to discover and remove bias primarily from query matrix features. We measure performance using Balanced Accuracy and Standard Accuracy, and fairness using Equalized Odds and Balanced Accuracy Difference. TADeT consistently leads to improved fairness over prior work on multiple attribute prediction tasks on the CelebA dataset, without compromising performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we look at Score-based generative models (also called diffusion generative models) from a geometric perspective. From a new view point, we prove that both the forward and backward process of adding noise and generating from noise are Wasserstein gradient flow in the space of probability measures. We are the first to prove this connection. Our understanding of Score-based (and Diffusion) generative models have matured and become more complete by drawing ideas from different fields like Bayesian inference, control theory, stochastic differential equation and Schrodinger bridge. However, many open questions and challenges remain. One problem, for example, is how to decrease the sampling time? We demonstrate that looking from geometric perspective enables us to answer many of these questions and provide new interpretations to some known results. Furthermore, geometric perspective enables us to devise an intuitive geometric solution to the problem of faster sampling. By augmenting traditional score-based generative models with a projection step, we show that we can generate high quality images with significantly fewer sampling-steps. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many open-domain dialogue systems rely on multiple response generators, any of which can contribute a response to the dialogue in a particular context. Thus the ability to compare potential responses and then select the best plays an important role in ensuring a dialogue system is coherent and engaging. Dialogue coherence goes beyond simply remaining on topic -- some trivia may be on topic and engaging when mentioned out of the blue, but may not be coherent and grounded in the context of the conversation. We carry out experiments on response selection in the Athena system, an Alexa Prize SocialBot that has dedicated content and multiple topic-specific response generators for a large number of topics. First, we collect a corpus of Athena conversations with live human traffic, where potential responses from all enabled response generators are logged and subsequently annotated for response quality. We compare several off-the-shelf response ranking methods for open-domain dialogue to Athena-Heuristic, a heuristic response ranker that was field-tested in Athena during the third Alexa Prize competition. We also compare these to a transformer-based response ranker we call Athena-RR, that we train on our Athena conversations. Athena-RR uses both the conversational context and the dialogue state to rank the potential responses. We find that Athena-RR with a Recall@1 of 70.79\% outperforms Athena-Heuristic and all of the off-the-shelf rankers by a large margin. We then conduct a live A/B study comparing Athena-Heuristic to Athena-RR in a 6,358 conversations with Alexa users. We show that Athena-RR leads to significantly longer conversations that receive significantly higher user ratings than the heuristic rule-based ranker. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent research has shown that language models exploit `artifacts' in benchmarks to solve tasks, rather than truly learning them, leading to inflated model performance. In pursuit of creating better benchmarks, we propose VAIDA, a novel benchmark creation paradigm for NLP, that focuses on guiding crowdworkers, an under-explored facet of addressing benchmark idiosyncrasies. VAIDA facilitates sample correction by providing realtime visual feedback and recommendations to improve sample quality. Our approach is domain, model, task, and metric agnostic, and constitutes a paradigm shift for robust, validated, and dynamic benchmark creation via human-and-metric-in-the-loop workflows. We evaluate via expert review and a user study with NASA TLX. We find that VAIDA decreases effort, frustration, mental, and temporal demands of crowdworkers and analysts, simultaneously increasing the performance of both user groups with a 45.8% decrease in the level of artifacts in created samples. As a by product of our user study, we observe that created samples are adversarial across models, leading to decreases of 31.3% (BERT), 22.5% (RoBERTa), 14.98% (GPT-3 fewshot) in performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Graph neural networks are widely used tools for graph prediction tasks. Motivated by their empirical performance, prior works have developed generalization bounds for graph neural networks, which scale with graph structures in terms of the maximum degree. In this paper, we present generalization bounds that instead scale with the largest singular value of the graph neural network's feature diffusion matrix. These bounds are numerically much smaller than prior bounds for real-world graphs. We also construct a lower bound of the generalization gap that matches our upper bound asymptotically. To achieve these results, we analyze a unified model that includes prior works' settings (i.e., convolutional and message-passing networks) and new settings (i.e., graph isomorphism networks). Our key idea is to measure the stability of graph neural networks against noise perturbations using Hessians. Empirically, we find that Hessian-based measurements correlate with the observed generalization gaps of graph neural networks accurately; Optimizing noise stability properties for fine-tuning pretrained graph neural networks also improves test performance on several graph-level classification tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, there has been an increased popularity in image and speech generation using diffusion models. However, directly generating music waveforms from free-form text prompts is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose the first text-to-waveform music generation model that can receive arbitrary texts using diffusion models. We incorporate the free-form textual prompt as the condition to guide the waveform generation process of diffusion models. To solve the problem of lacking such text-music parallel data, we collect a dataset of text-music pairs from the Internet with weak supervision. Besides, we compare the effect of two prompt formats of conditioning texts (music tags and free-form texts) and prove the superior performance of our method in terms of text-music relevance. We further demonstrate that our generated music in the waveform domain outperforms previous works by a large margin in terms of diversity, quality, and text-music relevance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the advance of language models, privacy protection is receiving more attention. Training data extraction is therefore of great importance, as it can serve as a potential tool to assess privacy leakage. However, due to the difficulty of this task, most of the existing methods are proof-of-concept and still not effective enough. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark tricks for improving training data extraction using a publicly available dataset. Because most existing extraction methods use a pipeline of generating-then-ranking, i.e., generating text candidates as potential training data and then ranking them based on specific criteria, our research focuses on the tricks for both text generation (e.g., sampling strategy) and text ranking (e.g., token-level criteria). The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction. Based on the GPT-Neo 1.3B evaluation results, our proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Multivariate time series forecasting has been widely used in various practical scenarios. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown significant potential in forecasting tasks due to the capture of long-range dependencies. However, recent studies in the vision and NLP fields show that the role of attention modules is not clear, which can be replaced by other token aggregation operations. This paper investigates the contributions and deficiencies of attention mechanisms on the performance of time series forecasting. Specifically, we find that (1) attention is not necessary for capturing temporal dependencies, (2) the entanglement and redundancy in the capture of temporal and channel interaction affect the forecasting performance, and (3) it is important to model the mapping between the input and the prediction sequence. To this end, we propose MTS-Mixers, which use two factorized modules to capture temporal and channel dependencies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show that MTS-Mixers outperform existing Transformer-based models with higher efficiency. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

By introducing Covid-19 vaccines, both positive and negative opinions were raised over the subject of taking vaccines or not. In this paper, using data gathered from Twitter, including tweets and user profiles, we offer a comprehensive analysis of public opinion in Iran about the Coronavirus vaccines. For this purpose, we applied a search query technique combined with a topic modeling approach to extract vaccine-related tweets. We utilized transformer-based models to classify the content of the tweets and extract themes revolving around vaccination. We also conducted an emotion analysis to evaluate the public happiness and anger around this topic.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: For the problems of low recognition rate and slow recognition speed of traditional detection methods in IC appearance defect detection, we propose an IC appearance defect detection algo-rithm IH-ViT. Our proposed model takes advantage of the respective strengths of CNN and ViT to acquire image features from both local and global aspects, and finally fuses the two features for decision making to determine the class of defects, thus obtaining better accuracy of IC defect recognition. To address the problem that IC appearance defects are mainly reflected in the dif-ferences in details, which are difficult to identify by traditional algorithms, we improved the tra-ditional ViT by performing an additional convolution operation inside the batch. For the problem of information imbalance of samples due to diverse sources of data sets, we adopt a dual-channel image segmentation technique to further improve the accuracy of IC appearance defects. Finally, after testing, our proposed hybrid IH-ViT model achieved 72.51% accuracy, which is 2.8% and 6.06% higher than ResNet50 and ViT models alone. The proposed algorithm can quickly and accurately detect the defect status of IC appearance and effectively improve the productivity of IC packaging and testing companies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Aim: To compare students' essay writing performance with or without employing ChatGPT-3 as a writing assistant tool. Materials and methods: Eighteen students participated in the study (nine in control and nine in the experimental group that used ChatGPT-3). We scored essay elements with grades (A-D) and corresponding numerical values (4-1). We compared essay scores to students' GPTs, writing time, authenticity, and content similarity. Results: Average grade was C for both groups; for control (2.39, SD=0.71) and for experimental (2.00, SD=0.73). None of the predictors affected essay scores: group (P=0.184), writing duration (P=0.669), module (P=0.388), and GPA (P=0.532). The text unauthenticity was slightly higher in the experimental group (11.87%, SD=13.45 to 9.96%, SD=9.81%), but the similarity among essays was generally low in the overall sample (the Jaccard similarity index ranging from 0 to 0.054). In the experimental group, AI classifier recognized more potential AI-generated texts. Conclusions: This study found no evidence that using GPT as a writing tool improves essay quality since the control group outperformed the experimental group in most parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As part of its digitization initiative, the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) wants to examine the extent to which natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to make independent decisions upon the eligibility criteria of securities prospectuses. Every month, the Directorate General Markets at the German Central Bank receives hundreds of scanned prospectuses in PDF format, which must be manually processed to decide upon their eligibility. We found that this tedious and time-consuming process can be (semi-)automated by employing modern NLP model architectures, which learn the linguistic feature representation in text to identify the present eligible and ineligible criteria. The proposed Decision Support System provides decisions of document-level eligibility criteria accompanied by human-understandable explanations of the decisions. The aim of this project is to model the described use case and to evaluate the extent to which current research results from the field of NLP can be applied to this problem. After creating a heterogeneous domain-specific dataset containing annotations of eligible and non-eligible mentions of relevant criteria, we were able to successfully build, train and deploy a semi-automatic decider model. This model is based on transformer-based language models and decision trees, which integrate the established rule-based parts of the decision processes. Results suggest that it is possible to efficiently model the problem and automate decision making to more than 90% for many of the considered eligibility criteria. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion Models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks, boosting a wave in AI for Art. Despite the success of commercialization, DMs meanwhile provide tools for copyright violations, where infringers benefit from illegally using paintings created by human artists to train DMs and generate novel paintings in a similar style. In this paper, we show that it is possible to create an image $x'$ that is similar to an image $x$ for human vision but unrecognizable for DMs. We build a framework to define and evaluate this adversarial example for diffusion models. Based on the framework, we further propose AdvDM, an algorithm to generate adversarial examples for DMs. By optimizing upon different latent variables sampled from the reverse process of DMs, AdvDM conducts a Monte-Carlo estimation of adversarial examples for DMs. Extensive experiments show that the estimated adversarial examples can effectively hinder DMs from extracting their features. Our method can be a powerful tool for human artists to protect their copyright against infringers with DM-based AI-for-Art applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Writing a survey paper on one research topic usually needs to cover the salient content from numerous related papers, which can be modeled as a multi-document summarization (MDS) task. Existing MDS datasets usually focus on producing the structureless summary covering a few input documents. Meanwhile, previous structured summary generation works focus on summarizing a single document into a multi-section summary. These existing datasets and methods cannot meet the requirements of summarizing numerous academic papers into a structured summary. To deal with the scarcity of available data, we propose BigSurvey, the first large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries of numerous academic papers on each topic. We collect target summaries from more than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference papers' abstracts as input documents. To organize the diverse content from dozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of processing long text sequences, we propose a summarization method named category-based alignment and sparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method outperforms various advanced summarization methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: It has been recognized that the data generated by the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) improves adversarial training. After two years of rapid development in diffusion models, a question naturally arises: can better diffusion models further improve adversarial training? This paper gives an affirmative answer by employing the most recent diffusion model which has higher efficiency ($\sim 20$ sampling steps) and image quality (lower FID score) compared with DDPM. Our adversarially trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance on RobustBench using only generated data (no external datasets). Under the $\ell_\infty$-norm threat model with $\epsilon=8/255$, our models achieve $70.69\%$ and $42.67\%$ robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively, i.e. improving upon previous state-of-the-art models by $+4.58\%$ and $+8.03\%$. Under the $\ell_2$-norm threat model with $\epsilon=128/255$, our models achieve $84.86\%$ on CIFAR-10 ($+4.44\%$). These results also beat previous works that use external data.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Structured and unstructured data and facts about drugs, genes, protein, viruses, and their mechanism are spread across a huge number of scientific articles. These articles are a large-scale knowledge source and can have a huge impact on disseminating knowledge about the mechanisms of certain biological processes. A domain-specific knowledge graph~(KG) is an explicit conceptualization of a specific subject-matter domain represented w.r.t semantically interrelated entities and relations. A KG can be constructed by integrating such facts and data and be used for data integration, exploration, and federated queries. However, exploration and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for certain groups of users due to a lack of knowledge about underlying data assets or semantic technologies. Such a KG will not only allow deducing new knowledge and question answering(QA) but also allows domain experts to explore. Since cross-disciplinary explanations are important for accurate diagnosis, it is important to query the KG to provide interactive explanations about learned biomarkers. Inspired by these, we construct a domain-specific KG, particularly for cancer-specific biomarker discovery. The KG is constructed by integrating cancer-related knowledge and facts from multiple sources. First, we construct a domain-specific ontology, which we call OncoNet Ontology (ONO). The ONO ontology is developed to enable semantic reasoning for verification of the predictions for relations between diseases and genes. The KG is then developed and enriched by harmonizing the ONO, additional metadata schemas, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and additional concepts from external sources using a BERT-based information extraction method. BioBERT and SciBERT are finetuned with the selected articles crawled from PubMed. We listed down some queries and some examples of QA and deducing knowledge based on the KG. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: HybrIK relies on a combination of analytical inverse kinematics and deep learning to produce more accurate 3D pose estimation from 2D monocular images. HybrIK has three major components: (1) pretrained convolution backbone, (2) deconvolution to lift 3D pose from 2D convolution features, (3) analytical inverse kinematics pass correcting deep learning prediction using learned distribution of plausible twist and swing angles. In this paper we propose an enhancement of the 2D to 3D lifting module, replacing deconvolution with Transformer, resulting in accuracy and computational efficiency improvement relative to the original HybrIK method. We demonstrate our results on commonly used H36M, PW3D, COCO and HP3D datasets.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: [Context and motivation] Incompleteness in natural-language requirements is a challenging problem. [Question/problem] A common technique for detecting incompleteness in requirements is checking the requirements against external sources. With the emergence of language models such as BERT, an interesting question is whether language models are useful external sources for finding potential incompleteness in requirements. [Principal ideas/results] We mask words in requirements and have BERT's masked language model (MLM) generate contextualized predictions for filling the masked slots. We simulate incompleteness by withholding content from requirements and measure BERT's ability to predict terminology that is present in the withheld content but absent in the content disclosed to BERT. [Contribution] BERT can be configured to generate multiple predictions per mask. Our first contribution is to determine how many predictions per mask is an optimal trade-off between effectively discovering omissions in requirements and the level of noise in the predictions. Our second contribution is devising a machine learning-based filter that post-processes predictions made by BERT to further reduce noise. We empirically evaluate our solution over 40 requirements specifications drawn from the PURE dataset [1]. Our results indicate that: (1) predictions made by BERT are highly effective at pinpointing terminology that is missing from requirements, and (2) our filter can substantially reduce noise from the predictions, thus making BERT a more compelling aid for improving completeness in requirements. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deriving robust control policies for realistic urban navigation scenarios is not a trivial task. In an end-to-end approach, these policies must map high-dimensional images from the vehicle's cameras to low-level actions such as steering and throttle. While pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are based exclusively on rewards,Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) agents learn from expert demonstrations while interacting with the environment, which favors GAIL on tasks for which a reward signal is difficult to derive. In this work, the hGAIL architecture was proposed to solve the autonomous navigation of a vehicle in an end-to-end approach, mapping sensory perceptions directly to low-level actions, while simultaneously learning mid-level input representations of the agent's environment. The proposed hGAIL consists of an hierarchical Adversarial Imitation Learning architecture composed of two main modules: the GAN (Generative Adversarial Nets) which generates the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation mainly from the images of three frontal cameras of the vehicle, and the GAIL which learns to control the vehicle based mainly on the BEV predictions from the GAN as input.Our experiments have shown that GAIL exclusively from cameras (without BEV) fails to even learn the task, while hGAIL, after training, was able to autonomously navigate successfully in all intersections of the city. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Lithium metal battery (LMB) has the potential to be the next-generation battery system because of their high theoretical energy density. However, defects known as dendrites are formed by heterogeneous lithium (Li) plating, which hinder the development and utilization of LMBs. Non-destructive techniques to observe the dendrite morphology often use computerized X-ray tomography (XCT) imaging to provide cross-sectional views. To retrieve three-dimensional structures inside a battery, image segmentation becomes essential to quantitatively analyze XCT images. This work proposes a new binary semantic segmentation approach using a transformer-based neural network (T-Net) model capable of segmenting out dendrites from XCT data. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed T-Net with three other algorithms, such as U-Net, Y-Net, and E-Net, consisting of an Ensemble Network model for XCT analysis. Our results show the advantages of using T-Net in terms of object metrics, such as mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (mDSC) as well as qualitatively through several comparative visualizations. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-to-image generation models represent the next step of evolution in image synthesis, offering natural means of flexible yet fine-grained control over the result. One emerging area of research is the rapid adaptation of large text-to-image models to smaller datasets or new visual concepts. However, the most efficient method of adaptation, called textual inversion, has a known limitation of long training time, which both restricts practical applications and increases the experiment time for research. In this work, we study the training dynamics of textual inversion, aiming to speed it up. We observe that most concepts are learned at early stages and do not improve in quality later, but standard model convergence metrics fail to indicate that. Instead, we propose a simple early stopping criterion that only requires computing the textual inversion loss on the same inputs for all training iterations. Our experiments on both Latent Diffusion and Stable Diffusion models for 93 concepts demonstrate the competitive performance of our method, speeding adaptation up to 15 times with no significant drops in quality. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated a very promising ability in high-resolution image synthesis. However, sampling from a pre-trained DPM usually requires hundreds of model evaluations, which is computationally expensive. Despite recent progress in designing high-order solvers for DPMs, there still exists room for further speedup, especially in extremely few steps (e.g., 5~10 steps). Inspired by the predictor-corrector for ODE solvers, we develop a unified corrector (UniC) that can be applied after any existing DPM sampler to increase the order of accuracy without extra model evaluations, and derive a unified predictor (UniP) that supports arbitrary order as a byproduct. Combining UniP and UniC, we propose a unified predictor-corrector framework called UniPC for the fast sampling of DPMs, which has a unified analytical form for any order and can significantly improve the sampling quality over previous methods. We evaluate our methods through extensive experiments including both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. Our UniPC can achieve 3.87 FID on CIFAR10 (unconditional) and 7.51 FID on ImageNet 256$\times$256 (conditional) with only 10 function evaluations.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present Reversible Vision Transformers, a memory efficient architecture design for visual recognition. By decoupling the GPU memory requirement from the depth of the model, Reversible Vision Transformers enable scaling up architectures with efficient memory usage. We adapt two popular models, namely Vision Transformer and Multiscale Vision Transformers, to reversible variants and benchmark extensively across both model sizes and tasks of image classification, object detection and video classification. Reversible Vision Transformers achieve a reduced memory footprint of up to 15.5x at roughly identical model complexity, parameters and accuracy, demonstrating the promise of reversible vision transformers as an efficient backbone for hardware resource limited training regimes. Finally, we find that the additional computational burden of recomputing activations is more than overcome for deeper models, where throughput can increase up to 2.3x over their non-reversible counterparts.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D-aware GANs offer new capabilities for creative content editing, such as view synthesis, while preserving the editing capability of their 2D counterparts. Using GAN inversion, these methods can reconstruct an image or a video by optimizing/predicting a latent code and achieve semantic editing by manipulating the latent code. However, a model pre-trained on a face dataset (e.g., FFHQ) often has difficulty handling faces with out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, (e.g., heavy make-up or occlusions). We address this issue by explicitly modeling OOD objects in face videos. Our core idea is to represent the face in a video using two neural radiance fields, one for in-distribution and the other for out-of-distribution data, and compose them together for reconstruction. Such explicit decomposition alleviates the inherent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editability. We evaluate our method's reconstruction accuracy and editability on challenging real videos and showcase favorable results against other baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper develops and analyzes a stochastic derivative-free optimization strategy. A key feature is the state-dependent adaptive variance. We prove global convergence in probability with algebraic rate and give the quantitative results in numerical examples. A striking fact is that convergence is achieved without explicit information of the gradient and even without comparing different objective function values as in established methods such as the simplex method and simulated annealing. It can otherwise be compared to annealing with state-dependent temperature. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper proposes an online, provably robust, and scalable Bayesian approach for changepoint detection. The resulting algorithm has key advantages over previous work: it provides provable robustness by leveraging the generalised Bayesian perspective, and also addresses the scalability issues of previous attempts. Specifically, the proposed generalised Bayesian formalism leads to conjugate posteriors whose parameters are available in closed form by leveraging diffusion score matching. The resulting algorithm is exact, can be updated through simple algebra, and is more than 10 times faster than its closest competitor. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
