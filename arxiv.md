        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image-guided story ending generation (IgSEG) is to generate a story ending based on given story plots and ending image. Existing methods focus on cross-modal feature fusion but overlook reasoning and mining implicit information from story plots and ending image. To tackle this drawback, we propose a multimodal event transformer, an event-based reasoning framework for IgSEG. Specifically, we construct visual and semantic event graphs from story plots and ending image, and leverage event-based reasoning to reason and mine implicit information in a single modality. Next, we connect visual and semantic event graphs and utilize cross-modal fusion to integrate different-modality features. In addition, we propose a multimodal injector to adaptive pass essential information to decoder. Besides, we present an incoherence detection to enhance the understanding context of a story plot and the robustness of graph modeling for our model. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for the image-guided story ending generation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This work aims to generate realistic anatomical deformations from static patient scans. Specifically, we present a method to generate these deformations/augmentations via deep learning driven respiratory motion simulation that provides the ground truth for validating deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms and driving more accurate deep learning based DIR. We present a novel 3D Seq2Seq deep learning respiratory motion simulator (RMSim) that learns from 4D-CT images and predicts future breathing phases given a static CT image. The predicted respiratory patterns, represented by time-varying displacement vector fields (DVFs) at different breathing phases, are modulated through auxiliary inputs of 1D breathing traces so that a larger amplitude in the trace results in more significant predicted deformation. Stacked 3D-ConvLSTMs are used to capture the spatial-temporal respiration patterns. Training loss includes a smoothness loss in the DVF and mean-squared error between the predicted and ground truth phase images. A spatial transformer deforms the static CT with the predicted DVF to generate the predicted phase image. 10-phase 4D-CTs of 140 internal patients were used to train and test RMSim. The trained RMSim was then used to augment a public DIR challenge dataset for training VoxelMorph to show the effectiveness of RMSim-generated deformation augmentation. We validated our RMSim output with both private and public benchmark datasets (healthy and cancer patients). The proposed approach can be used for validating DIR algorithms as well as for patient-specific augmentations to improve deep learning DIR algorithms. The code, pretrained models, and augmented DIR validation datasets will be released at https://github.com/nadeemlab/SeqX2Y. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce 3DShape2VecSet, a novel shape representation for neural fields designed for generative diffusion models. Our shape representation can encode 3D shapes given as surface models or point clouds, and represents them as neural fields. The concept of neural fields has previously been combined with a global latent vector, a regular grid of latent vectors, or an irregular grid of latent vectors. Our new representation encodes neural fields on top of a set of vectors. We draw from multiple concepts, such as the radial basis function representation and the cross attention and self-attention function, to design a learnable representation that is especially suitable for processing with transformers. Our results show improved performance in 3D shape encoding and 3D shape generative modeling tasks. We demonstrate a wide variety of generative applications: unconditioned generation, category-conditioned generation, text-conditioned generation, point-cloud completion, and image-conditioned generation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: For pursuing accurate skeleton-based action recognition, most prior methods use the strategy of combining Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) with attention-based methods in a serial way. However, they regard the human skeleton as a complete graph, resulting in less variations between different actions (e.g., the connection between the elbow and head in action ``clapping hands''). For this, we propose a novel Contrastive GCN-Transformer Network (ConGT) which fuses the spatial and temporal modules in a parallel way. The ConGT involves two parallel streams: Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution stream (STG) and Spatial-Temporal Transformer stream (STT). The STG is designed to obtain action representations maintaining the natural topology structure of the human skeleton. The STT is devised to acquire action representations containing the global relationships among joints. Since the action representations produced from these two streams contain different characteristics, and each of them knows little information of the other, we introduce the contrastive learning paradigm to guide their output representations of the same sample to be as close as possible in a self-supervised manner. Through the contrastive learning, they can learn information from each other to enrich the action features by maximizing the mutual information between the two types of action representations. To further improve action recognition accuracy, we introduce the Cyclical Focal Loss (CFL) which can focus on confident training samples in early training epochs, with an increasing focus on hard samples during the middle epochs. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we present an analysis of the generalization of Neural Operators (NOs) and derived architectures. We proposed a family of networks, which we name (${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}+\varepsilon$), where we modify the layout of NOs towards an architecture resembling a Transformer; mainly, we substitute the Attention module with the Integral Operator part of NOs. The resulting network preserves universality, has a better generalization to unseen data, and similar number of parameters as NOs. On the one hand, we study numerically the generalization by gradually transforming NOs into ${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}+\varepsilon$ and verifying a reduction of the test loss considering a time-harmonic wave dataset with different frequencies. We perform the following changes in NOs: (a) we split the Integral Operator (non-local) and the (local) feed-forward network (MLP) into different layers, generating a {\it sequential} structure which we call sequential Neural Operator (${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}$), (b) we add the skip connection, and layer normalization in ${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}$, and (c) we incorporate dropout and stochastic depth that allows us to generate deep networks. In each case, we observe a decrease in the test loss in a wide variety of initialization, indicating that our changes outperform the NO. On the other hand, building on infinite-dimensional Statistics, and in particular the Dudley Theorem, we provide bounds of the Rademacher complexity of NOs and ${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}$, and we find the following relationship: the upper bound of the Rademacher complexity of the ${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}$ is a lower-bound of the NOs, thereby, the generalization error bound of ${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}$ is smaller than NO, which further strengthens our numerical results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As previous representations for reinforcement learning cannot effectively incorporate a human-intuitive understanding of the 3D environment, they usually suffer from sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we present Semantic-aware Neural Radiance Fields for Reinforcement Learning (SNeRL), which jointly optimizes semantic-aware neural radiance fields (NeRF) with a convolutional encoder to learn 3D-aware neural implicit representation from multi-view images. We introduce 3D semantic and distilled feature fields in parallel to the RGB radiance fields in NeRF to learn semantic and object-centric representation for reinforcement learning. SNeRL outperforms not only previous pixel-based representations but also recent 3D-aware representations both in model-free and model-based reinforcement learning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural rendering has emerged as a powerful paradigm for synthesizing images, offering many benefits over classical rendering by using neural networks to reconstruct surfaces, represent shapes, and synthesize novel views, either for objects or scenes. In this neural rendering, the environment is encoded into a neural network. We believe that these new representations can be used to codify the scene for a mobile robot. Therefore, in this work, we perform a comparison between a trending neural rendering, called tiny-NeRF, and other volume representations that are commonly used as maps in robotics, such as voxel maps, point clouds, and triangular meshes. The target is to know the advantages and disadvantages of neural representations in the robotics context. The comparison is made in terms of spatial complexity and processing time to obtain a model. Experiments show that tiny-NeRF requires three times less memory space compared to other representations. In terms of processing time, tiny-NeRF takes about six times more to compute the model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Layout design is an important task in various design fields, including user interfaces, document, and graphic design. As this task requires tedious manual effort by designers, prior works have attempted to automate this process using generative models, but commonly fell short of providing intuitive user controls and achieving design objectives. In this paper, we build a conditional latent diffusion model, PLay, that generates parametrically conditioned layouts in vector graphic space from user-specified guidelines, which are commonly used by designers for representing their design intents in current practices. Our method outperforms prior works across three datasets on metrics including FID and FD-VG, and in user test. Moreover, it brings a novel and interactive experience to professional layout design processes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Vision transformers have been demonstrated to yield state-of-the-art results on a variety of computer vision tasks using attention-based networks. However, research works in transformers mostly do not investigate robustness/accuracy trade-off, and they still struggle to handle adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we explore the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial perturbations and try to enhance their robustness/accuracy trade-off in white box attack settings. To this end, we propose Locality iN Locality (LNL) transformer model. We prove that the locality introduction to LNL contributes to the robustness performance since it aggregates local information such as lines, edges, shapes, and even objects. In addition, to further improve the robustness performance, we encourage LNL to extract training signal from the moments (a.k.a., mean and standard deviation) and the normalized features. We validate the effectiveness and generality of LNL by achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and robustness metrics on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR-10). More specifically, for traffic sign classification, the proposed LNL yields gains of 1.1% and ~35% in terms of clean and robustness accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art studies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Guided diffusion is a technique for conditioning the output of a diffusion model at sampling time without retraining the network for each specific task. One drawback of diffusion models, however, is their slow sampling process. Recent techniques can accelerate unguided sampling by applying high-order numerical methods to the sampling process when viewed as differential equations. On the contrary, we discover that the same techniques do not work for guided sampling, and little has been explored about its acceleration. This paper explores the culprit of this problem and provides a solution based on operator splitting methods, motivated by our key finding that classical high-order numerical methods are unsuitable for the conditional function. Our proposed method can re-utilize the high-order methods for guided sampling and can generate images with the same quality as a 250-step DDIM baseline using 32-58% less sampling time on ImageNet256. We also demonstrate usage on a wide variety of conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation, colorization, inpainting, and super-resolution. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As a few large-scale pre-trained models become the major choices of various applications, new challenges arise for model pruning, e.g., can we avoid pruning the same model from scratch for every downstream task? How to reuse the pruning results of previous tasks to accelerate the pruning for a new task? To address these challenges, we create a small model for a new task from the pruned models of similar tasks. We show that a few fine-tuning steps on this model suffice to produce a promising pruned-model for the new task. We study this ''meta-pruning'' from nearest tasks on two major classes of pre-trained models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT), under a limited budget of pruning iterations. Our study begins by investigating the overlap of pruned models for similar tasks and how the overlap changes over different layers and blocks. Inspired by these discoveries, we develop a simple but effective ''Meta-Vote Pruning (MVP)'' method that significantly reduces the pruning iterations for a new task by initializing a sub-network from the pruned models of its nearest tasks. In experiments, we demonstrate MVP's advantages in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization through extensive empirical studies and comparisons with popular pruning methods over several datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Social media is a modern person's digital voice to project and engage with new ideas and mobilise communities $\unicode{x2013}$ a power shared with extremists. Given the societal risks of unvetted content-moderating algorithms for Extremism, Radicalisation, and Hate speech (ERH) detection, responsible software engineering must understand the who, what, when, where, and why such models are necessary to protect user safety and free expression. Hence, we propose and examine the unique research field of ERH context mining to unify disjoint studies. Specifically, we evaluate the start-to-finish design process from socio-technical definition-building and dataset collection strategies to technical algorithm design and performance. Our 2015-2021 51-study Systematic Literature Review (SLR) provides the first cross-examination of textual, network, and visual approaches to detecting extremist affiliation, hateful content, and radicalisation towards groups and movements. We identify consensus-driven ERH definitions and propose solutions to existing ideological and geographic biases, particularly due to the lack of research in Oceania/Australasia. Our hybridised investigation on Natural Language Processing, Community Detection, and visual-text models demonstrates the dominating performance of textual transformer-based algorithms. We conclude with vital recommendations for ERH context mining researchers and propose an uptake roadmap with guidelines for researchers, industries, and governments to enable a safer cyberspace. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT have recently demonstrated impressive results across a wide range of tasks. LLMs are still limited, however, in that they frequently fail at complex reasoning, their reasoning processes are opaque, they are prone to 'hallucinate' facts, and there are concerns about their underlying biases. Letting models verbalize reasoning steps as natural language, a technique known as chain-of-thought prompting, has recently been proposed as a way to address some of these issues. Here we present the first release of ThoughtSource, a meta-dataset and software library for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The goal of ThoughtSource is to improve future artificial intelligence systems by facilitating qualitative understanding of CoTs, enabling empirical evaluations, and providing training data. This first release of ThoughtSource integrates six scientific/medical, three general-domain and five math word question answering datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Learning to represent free text is a core task in many clinical machine learning (ML) applications, as clinical text contains observations and plans not otherwise available for inference. State-of-the-art methods use large language models developed with immense computational resources and training data; however, applying these models is challenging because of the highly varying syntax and vocabulary in clinical free text. Structured information such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes often succinctly abstracts the most important facts of a clinical encounter and yields good performance, but is often not as available as clinical text in real-world scenarios. We propose a \textbf{multi-view learning framework} that jointly learns from codes and text to combine the availability and forward-looking nature of text and better performance of ICD codes. The learned text embeddings can be used as inputs to predictive algorithms independent of the ICD codes during inference. Our approach uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process ICD codes, and Bi-LSTM to process text. We apply Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to enforce the two views to learn a similar representation of each patient. In experiments using planned surgical procedure text, our model outperforms BERT models fine-tuned to clinical data, and in experiments using diverse text in MIMIC-III, our model is competitive to a fine-tuned BERT at a tiny fraction of its computational effort. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel denoising diffusion generative model for predicting nonlinear fluid fields named FluidDiff. By performing a diffusion process, the model is able to learn a complex representation of the high-dimensional dynamic system, and then Langevin sampling is used to generate predictions for the flow state under specified initial conditions. The model is trained with finite, discrete fluid simulation data. We demonstrate that our model has the capacity to model the distribution of simulated training data and that it gives accurate predictions on the test data. Without encoded prior knowledge of the underlying physical system, it shares competitive performance with other deep learning models for fluid prediction, which is promising for investigation on new computational fluid dynamics methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this article, we use probing to investigate phenomena that occur during fine-tuning and knowledge distillation of a BERT-based natural language understanding (NLU) model. Our ultimate purpose was to use probing to better understand practical production problems and consequently to build better NLU models. We designed experiments to see how fine-tuning changes the linguistic capabilities of BERT, what the optimal size of the fine-tuning dataset is, and what amount of information is contained in a distilled NLU based on a tiny Transformer. The results of the experiments show that the probing paradigm in its current form is not well suited to answer such questions. Structural, Edge and Conditional probes do not take into account how easy it is to decode probed information. Consequently, we conclude that quantification of information decodability is critical for many practical applications of the probing paradigm. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale data missing is a challenging problem in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Many studies have been carried out to impute large-scale traffic data by considering their spatiotemporal correlations at a network level. In existing traffic data imputations, however, rich semantic information of a road network has been largely ignored when capturing network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. This study proposes a Graph Transformer for Traffic Data Imputation (GT-TDI) model to impute large-scale traffic data with spatiotemporal semantic understanding of a road network. Specifically, the proposed model introduces semantic descriptions consisting of network-wide spatial and temporal information of traffic data to help the GT-TDI model capture spatiotemporal correlations at a network level. The proposed model takes incomplete data, the social connectivity of sensors, and semantic descriptions as input to perform imputation tasks with the help of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer. On the PeMS freeway dataset, extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed GT-TDI model with conventional methods, tensor factorization methods, and deep learning-based methods. The results show that the proposed GT-TDI outperforms existing methods in complex missing patterns and diverse missing rates. The code of the GT-TDI model will be available at https://github.com/KP-Zhang/GT-TDI. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models have shown an impressive generation quality, although their long sampling chain leads to high computational costs. In this paper, we observe that a long sampling chain also leads to an error accumulation phenomenon, which is similar to the \textbf{exposure bias} problem in autoregressive text generation. Specifically, we note that there is a discrepancy between training and testing, since the former is conditioned on the ground truth samples, while the latter is conditioned on the previously generated results. To alleviate this problem, we propose a very simple but effective training regularization, consisting in perturbing the ground truth samples to simulate the inference time prediction errors. We empirically show that the proposed input perturbation leads to a significant improvement of the sample quality while reducing both the training and the inference times. For instance, on CelebA 64$\times$64, we achieve a new state-of-the-art FID score of 1.27, while saving 37.5% of the training time. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

However, their operational usability is limited by difficulties explaining dynamics behind the predictions, which are smoothed out and missing the high-frequency features due to optimizing for mean error loss functions. We experiment with hand-engineering of the advection-diffusion differential equation into a PhyCell to introduce more accurate physical prior to a PhyDNet model that disentangles physical and residual dynamics. Results indicate that while PhyCell can learn the intended dynamics, training of PhyDNet remains driven by loss optimization, resulting in a model with the same prediction capabilities. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The gap between speech and text modalities is a major challenge in speech-to-text translation (ST). Different methods have been proposed for reducing this gap, but most of them require architectural changes in ST training. In this work, we propose to mitigate this issue at the pre-training stage, requiring no change in the ST model. First, we show that the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss can reduce the modality gap by design. We provide a quantitative comparison with the more common cross-entropy loss, showing that pre-training with CTC consistently achieves better final ST accuracy. Nevertheless, CTC is only a partial solution and thus, in our second contribution, we propose a novel pre-training method combining CTC and optimal transport to further reduce this gap. Our method pre-trains a Siamese-like model composed of two encoders, one for acoustic inputs and the other for textual inputs, such that they produce representations that are close to each other in the Wasserstein space. Extensive experiments on the standard CoVoST-2 and MuST-C datasets show that our pre-training method applied to the vanilla encoder-decoder Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance under the no-external-data setting, and performs on par with recent strong multi-task learning systems trained with external data. Finally, our method can also be applied on top of these multi-task systems, leading to further improvements for these models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: An important milestone for AI is the development of algorithms that can produce drawings that are indistinguishable from those of humans. Here, we adapt the 'diversity vs. recognizability' scoring framework from Boutin et al, 2022 and find that one-shot diffusion models have indeed started to close the gap between humans and machines. However, using a finer-grained measure of the originality of individual samples, we show that strengthening the guidance of diffusion models helps improve the humanness of their drawings, but they still fall short of approximating the originality and recognizability of human drawings. Comparing human category diagnostic features, collected through an online psychophysics experiment, against those derived from diffusion models reveals that humans rely on fewer and more localized features. Overall, our study suggests that diffusion models have significantly helped improve the quality of machine-generated drawings; however, a gap between humans and machines remains -- in part explainable by discrepancies in visual strategies. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Satellite images often contain a significant level of sensitive data compared to ground-view images. That is why satellite images are more likely to be intentionally manipulated to hide specific objects and structures. GAN-based approaches have been employed to create forged images with two major problems: (i) adding a new object to the scene to hide a specific object or region may create unrealistic merging with surrounding areas; and (ii) using masks on color feature images has proven to be unsuccessful in GAN-based object removal. In this paper, we tackle the problem of object removal in high-resolution satellite images given a limited number of training data. Furthermore, we take advantage of conditional GANs (CGANs) to collect perhaps the first GAN-based forged satellite image data set. All forged instances were manipulated via CGANs trained by Canny Feature Images for object removal. As part of our experiments, we demonstrate that distinguishing the collected forged images from authentic (original) images is highly challenging for fake image detector models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A data-driven framework is presented, that enables the prediction of quantities, either observations or parameters, given sufficient partial data. The framework is illustrated via a computational model of the deposition of Cu in a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactor, where the reactor pressure, the deposition temperature and feed mass flow rate are important process parameters that determine the outcome of the process. The sampled observations are high-dimensional vectors containing the outputs of a detailed CFD steady-state model of the process, i.e. the values of velocity, pressure, temperature, and species mass fractions at each point in the discretization. A machine learning workflow is presented, able to predict out-of-sample (a) observations (e.g. mass fraction in the reactor) given process parameters (e.g. inlet temperature); (b) process parameters given observation data; and (c) partial observations (e.g. temperature in the reactor) given other partial observations (e.g. mass fraction in the reactor). The proposed workflow relies on the manifold learning schemes Diffusion Maps and the associated Geometric Harmonics. Diffusion Maps is used for discovering a reduced representation of the available data, and Geometric Harmonics for extending functions defined on the manifold. In our work a special use case of Geometric Harmonics is formulated and implemented, which we call Double Diffusion Maps, to map from the reduced representation back to (partial) observations and process parameters. A comparison of our manifold learning scheme to the traditional Gappy-POD approach is provided: ours can be thought of as a "Gappy DMAP" approach. The presented methodology is easily transferable to application domains beyond reactor engineering. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The recent surge in popularity of diffusion models for image generation has brought new attention to the potential of these models in other areas of media synthesis. One area that has yet to be fully explored is the application of diffusion models to music generation. Music generation requires to handle multiple aspects, including the temporal dimension, long-term structure, multiple layers of overlapping sounds, and nuances that only trained listeners can detect. In our work, we investigate the potential of diffusion models for text-conditional music generation. We develop a cascading latent diffusion approach that can generate multiple minutes of high-quality stereo music at 48kHz from textual descriptions. For each model, we make an effort to maintain reasonable inference speed, targeting real-time on a single consumer GPU. In addition to trained models, we provide a collection of open-source libraries with the hope of facilitating future work in the field. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fisheye image rectification has a long-term unresolved issue with synthetic-to-real generalization. In most previous works, the model trained on the synthetic images obtains unsatisfactory performance on the real-world fisheye image. To this end, we propose a Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for the fisheye rectification with a better generalization ability. The proposed DDA is simultaneously trained with paired synthetic fisheye images and unlabeled real fisheye images. By gradually introducing noises, the synthetic and real fisheye images can eventually develop into a consistent noise distribution, improving the generalization and achieving unlabeled real fisheye correction. The original image serves as the prior guidance in existing DDPMs (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models). However, the non-negligible indeterminate relationship between the prior condition and the target affects the generation performance. Especially in the rectification task, the radial distortion can cause significant artifacts. Therefore, we provide an unsupervised one-pass network that produces a plausible new condition to strengthen guidance. This network can be regarded as an alternate scheme for fast producing reliable results without iterative inference. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can reach superior performance in both synthetic and real fisheye image corrections. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods operate on unlabeled data to learn robust representations useful for downstream tasks. Most SSL methods rely on augmentations obtained by transforming the 2D image pixel map. These augmentations ignore the fact that biological vision takes place in an immersive three-dimensional, temporally contiguous environment, and that low-level biological vision relies heavily on depth cues. Using a signal provided by a pretrained state-of-the-art monocular RGB-to-depth model (the \emph{Depth Prediction Transformer}, Ranftl et al., 2021), we explore two distinct approaches to incorporating depth signals into the SSL framework. First, we evaluate contrastive learning using an RGB+depth input representation. Second, we use the depth signal to generate novel views from slightly different camera positions, thereby producing a 3D augmentation for contrastive learning. We evaluate these two approaches on three different SSL methods -- BYOL, SimSiam, and SwAV -- using ImageNette (10 class subset of ImageNet), ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k datasets. We find that both approaches to incorporating depth signals improve the robustness and generalization of the baseline SSL methods, though the first approach (with depth-channel concatenation) is superior. For instance, BYOL with the additional depth channel leads to an increase in downstream classification accuracy from 85.3\% to 88.0\% on ImageNette and 84.1\% to 87.0\% on ImageNet-C. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

To overcome this, we propose to leverage long-sequence transformer models (e.g., Longformer and BigBird), which extend the maximum input sequence length from 512 to 4096, to enhance the ability to model long-term dependencies in long clinical texts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present a study on sentence-level factuality and bias of news articles across domains. While prior work in NLP has mainly focused on predicting the factuality of article-level news reporting and political-ideological bias of news media, we investigated the effects of framing bias in factual reporting across domains so as to predict factuality and bias at the sentence level, which may explain more accurately the overall reliability of the entire document. First, we manually produced a large sentence-level annotated dataset, titled FactNews, composed of 6,191 sentences from 100 news stories by three different outlets, resulting in 300 news articles. Further, we studied how biased and factual spans surface in news articles from different media outlets and different domains. Lastly, a baseline model for factual sentence prediction was presented by fine-tuning BERT. We also provide a detailed analysis of data demonstrating the reliability of the annotation and models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Many deep learning applications benefit from using large models with billions of parameters. Training these models is notoriously expensive due to the need for specialized HPC clusters. In this work, we consider alternative setups for training large models: using cheap "preemptible" instances or pooling existing resources from multiple regions. We analyze the performance of existing model-parallel algorithms in these conditions and find configurations where training larger models becomes less communication-intensive. Based on these findings, we propose SWARM parallelism, a model-parallel training algorithm designed for poorly connected, heterogeneous and unreliable devices. SWARM creates temporary randomized pipelines between nodes that are rebalanced in case of failure. We empirically validate our findings and compare SWARM parallelism with existing large-scale training approaches. Finally, we combine our insights with compression strategies to train a large Transformer language model with 1B shared parameters (approximately 13B before sharing) on preemptible T4 GPUs with less than 200Mb/s network. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, pre-trained large language models have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in achieving an inference-time few-shot learning capability known as in-context learning. However, existing literature has highlighted the sensitivity of this capability to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. The underlying mechanisms by which this capability arises from regular language model pretraining objectives remain poorly understood. In this study, we aim to examine the in-context learning phenomenon through a Bayesian lens, viewing large language models as topic models that implicitly infer task-related information from demonstrations. On this premise, we propose an algorithm for selecting optimal demonstrations from a set of annotated data and demonstrate a significant 12.5% improvement relative to the random selection baseline, averaged over eight GPT2 and GPT3 models on eight different real-world text classification datasets. Our empirical findings support our hypothesis that large language models implicitly infer a latent concept variable. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is an important task in medical image analysis. Recent years have seen many deep learning based methods, proved to be effective in this area. However, these methods mostly follow a supervised architecture, which needs paired CT image of full dose and quarter dose, and the solution is highly dependent on specific measurements. In this work, we introduce Denoising Diffusion LDCT Model, dubbed as DDLM, generating noise-free CT image using conditioned sampling. DDLM uses pretrained model, and need no training nor tuning process, thus our proposal is in unsupervised manner. Experiments on LDCT images have shown comparable performance of DDLM using less inference time, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods, proving both accurate and efficient. Implementation code will be set to public soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has recently gained popularity in the field of computer vision, thanks to its image generation applications, such as Imagen, Latent Diffusion Models, and Stable Diffusion, which have demonstrated impressive capabilities and sparked much discussion within the community. Recent studies have also found DPM to be useful in the field of medical image analysis, as evidenced by the strong performance of the medical image segmentation model MedSegDiff in various tasks. While these models were originally designed with a UNet backbone, they may also potentially benefit from the incorporation of vision transformer techniques. However, we discovered that simply combining these two approaches resulted in subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based conditional UNet framework, as well as a new Spectrum-Space Transformer (SS-Former) to model the interaction between noise and semantic features. This architectural improvement leads to a new diffusion-based medical image segmentation method called MedSegDiff-V2, which significantly improves the performance of MedSegDiff. We have verified the effectiveness of MedSegDiff-V2 on eighteen organs of five segmentation datasets with different image modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate that MedSegDiff-V2 outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a considerable margin, further proving the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed model. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
