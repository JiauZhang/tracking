        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We conduct a pilot study selectively evaluating the cognitive abilities (decision making and spatial reasoning) of two recently released generative transformer models, ChatGPT and DALL-E 2. Input prompts were constructed following neutral a priori guidelines, rather than adversarial intent. Post hoc qualitative analysis of the outputs shows that DALL-E 2 is able to generate at least one correct image for each spatial reasoning prompt, but most images generated are incorrect (even though the model seems to have a clear understanding of the objects mentioned in the prompt). Similarly, in evaluating ChatGPT on the rationality axioms developed under the classical Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem, we find that, although it demonstrates some level of rational decision-making, many of its decisions violate at least one of the axioms even under reasonable constructions of preferences, bets, and decision-making prompts. ChatGPT's outputs on such problems generally tended to be unpredictable: even as it made irrational decisions (or employed an incorrect reasoning process) for some simpler decision-making problems, it was able to draw correct conclusions for more complex bet structures. We briefly comment on the nuances and challenges involved in scaling up such a 'cognitive' evaluation or conducting it with a closed set of answer keys ('ground truth'), given that these models are inherently generative and open-ended in responding to prompts. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Vision Transformer models, such as ViT, Swin Transformer, and Transformer-in-Transformer, have recently gained significant traction in computer vision tasks due to their ability to capture the global relation between features which leads to superior performance. However, they are compute-heavy and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained edge devices. Existing hardware accelerators, including those for the closely-related BERT transformer models, do not target highly resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we address this gap and propose ViTA - a configurable hardware accelerator for inference of vision transformer models, targeting resource-constrained edge computing devices and avoiding repeated off-chip memory accesses. We employ a head-level pipeline and inter-layer MLP optimizations, and can support several commonly used vision transformer models with changes solely in our control logic. We achieve nearly 90% hardware utilization efficiency on most vision transformer models, report a power of 0.88W when synthesised with a clock of 150 MHz, and get reasonable frame rates - all of which makes ViTA suitable for edge applications. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Creative writing is hard: Novelists struggle with writer's block daily. While automatic story generation has advanced recently, it is treated as a "toy task" for advancing artificial intelligence rather than helping people. In this paper, we create a system that produces a short description that narrates a predicted plot using existing story generation approaches. Our goal is to assist writers in crafting a consistent and compelling story arc. We conducted experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to examine the quality of the generated story plots in terms of consistency and storiability. The results show that short descriptions produced by our frame-enhanced GPT-2 (FGPT-2) were rated as the most consistent and storiable among all models; FGPT-2's outputs even beat some random story snippets written by humans. Next, we conducted a preliminary user study using a story continuation task where AMT workers were given access to machine-generated story plots and asked to write a follow-up story. FGPT-2 could positively affect the writing process, though people favor other baselines more. Our study shed some light on the possibilities of future creative writing support systems beyond the scope of completing sentences.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The limits of open-ended generative models are unclear, yet increasingly important. What causes them to succeed and what causes them to fail? In this paper, we take a prompt-centric approach to analyzing and bounding the abilities of open-ended generative models. We present a generic methodology of analysis with two challenging prompt constraint types: structural and stylistic. These constraint types are categorized into a set of well-defined constraints that are analyzable by a single prompt. We then systematically create a diverse set of simple, natural, and useful prompts to robustly analyze each individual constraint. Using the GPT-3 text-davinci-002 model as a case study, we generate outputs from our collection of prompts and analyze the model's generative failures. We also show the generalizability of our proposed method on other large models like BLOOM and OPT. Our results and our in-context mitigation strategies reveal open challenges for future research.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Human Action Recognition (HAR) involves the task of categorizing actions present in video sequences. Although it presents interesting problems, it remains one of the most challenging domains in pattern recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have demonstrated exceptional success in image recognition and related areas. However, these advanced techniques are not always directly applicable to HAR, as the consideration of temporal features is crucial. In this paper, we present a dynamic PSO-ConvNet model for learning actions in video, drawing on our recent research in image recognition. Our methods are based on a framework where the weight vector of each neural network serves as the position of a particle in phase space, and particles exchange their current weight vectors and gradient estimates of the Loss function. We extend the approach to video by integrating a ConvNet with state-of-the-art temporal methods such as Transformer and Recurrent Neural Networks. The results reveal substantial advancements, with improvements of up to 9% on UCF-101 dataset.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We investigate the linear stability analysis of a pathway-based diffusion model (PBDM), which characterizes the dynamics of the engineered Escherichia coli populations [X. Xue and C. Xue and M. Tang, P LoS Computational Biology, 14 (2018), pp. e1006178]. This stability analysis considers small perturbations of the density and chemical concentration around two non-trivial steady states, and the linearized equations are transformed into a generalized eigenvalue problem. By formal analysis, when the internal variable responds to the outside signal fast enough, the PBDM converges to an anisotropic diffusion model, for which the probability density distribution in the internal variable becomes a delta function. We introduce an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme for the PBDM that converges to a stable limit scheme consistent with the anisotropic diffusion model. Further numerical simulations demonstrate the theoretical results of linear stability analysis, i.e., the pattern formation, and the convergence of the AP scheme. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have shown remarkable capabilities for natural language generation, but their performance for machine translation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT models for machine translation, covering various aspects such as quality of different GPT models in comparison with state-of-the-art research and commercial systems, effect of prompting strategies, robustness towards domain shifts and document-level translation. We experiment with eighteen different translation directions involving high and low resource languages, as well as non English-centric translations, and evaluate the performance of three GPT models: ChatGPT, GPT3.5 (text-davinci-003), and text-davinci-002. Our results show that GPT models achieve very competitive translation quality for high resource languages, while having limited capabilities for low resource languages. We also show that hybrid approaches, which combine GPT models with other translation systems, can further enhance the translation quality. We perform comprehensive analysis and human evaluation to further understand the characteristics of GPT translations. We hope that our paper provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field and helps to better understand the potential and limitations of GPT models for translation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization performance on downstream tasks by leveraging carefully designed language prompts. However, despite their success, most prompt learning techniques tend to underperform in the presence of domain shift. Our study addresses this problem and, to improve CLIP's generalization ability across domains, proposes \textsc{StyLIP}, a novel approach for Domain Generalization (DG) based on a domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy. In the absence of explicit domain knowledge, we aim to disentangle the visual style and the content information extracted from the pre-trained CLIP in the prompts so they can be effortlessly adapted to novel domains during inference. Furthermore, we consider a set of style projectors to learn the prompt tokens directly from these multi-scale style features, and the generated prompt embeddings are later fused with the multi-scale visual features learned through a content projector. The projectors are contrastively trained, given CLIP's frozen vision and text encoders. We present extensive experiments in five different DG settings on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that \textsc{StyLIP} consistently outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image manipulation on the latent space of the pre-trained StyleGAN can control the semantic attributes of the generated images. Recently, some studies have focused on detecting channels with specific properties to directly manipulate the latent code, which is limited by the entanglement of the latent space. To detect the attribute-specific channels, we propose a novel detection method in the context of pre-trained classifiers. We analyse the gradients layer by layer on the style space. The intensities of the gradients indicate the channel's responses to specific attributes. The latent style codes of channels control separate attributes in the layers. We choose channels with top-$k$ gradients to control specific attributes in the maximum response layer. We implement single-channel and multi-channel manipulations with a certain attribute. Our methods can accurately detect relevant channels for a large number of face attributes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods in generalization and scalability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Realistic models of the components and processes are required for molecular communication (MC) systems. In this paper, a spheroidal receiver structure is proposed for MC that is inspired by the 3D cell cultures known as spheroids being widely used in organ-on-chip systems. A simple diffusive MC system is considered where the spheroidal receiver and a point source transmitter are in an unbounded fluid environment. The spheroidal receiver is modeled as a porous medium for diffusive signaling molecules, then its boundary conditions and effective diffusion coefficient are characterized. It is revealed that the spheroid amplifies the diffusion signal, but also disperses the signal which reduces the information communication rate. Furthermore, we analytically formulate and derive the concentration Green's function inside and outside the spheroid in terms of infinite series-forms that are confirmed by a particle-based simulator (PBS). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

[Method] We investigate several effective strategies and choose their best combination setting as the training recipes. As for model structure, we employ the vanilla Transformer with disentangled attention as the basic block encoder. For self-supervised training, we employ the representative denoising objective (i.e., replaced token detection) in phase 1 and combine the contrastive objective (i.e., sentence embedding contrastive learning) with it in phase 2. During fine-tuning, several advanced techniques such as transductive fine-tuning, self-calibrated fine-tuning, and adversarial fine-tuning are adopted. [Results] According to our submission record (Jan. 2022), with our optimized pretraining and fine-tuning strategies, our 1.3 billion model sets new state-of-the-art on 4/9 tasks, achieving the best average score of 91.3. Encouragingly, our Vega v1 is the first to exceed powerful human performance on the two challenging tasks, i.e., SST-2 and WNLI. We believe our empirically successful recipe with a bag of tricks could shed new light on developing efficient discriminative large language models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With recently available football match event data that record the details of football matches, analysts and researchers have a great opportunity to develop new performance metrics, gain insight, and evaluate key performance. However, most sports sequential events modeling methods and performance metrics approaches could be incomprehensive in dealing with such large-scale spatiotemporal data (in particular, temporal process), thereby necessitating a more comprehensive spatiotemporal model and a holistic performance metric. To this end, we proposed the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model for football event data based on the neural temporal point processes (NTPP) framework. In the experiments, our model outperformed the prediction performance of the baseline models. Furthermore, we proposed the holistic possession utilization score (HPUS) metric for a more comprehensive football possession analysis. For verification, we examined the relationship with football teams' final ranking, average goal score, and average xG over a season. It was observed that the average HPUS showed significant correlations regardless of not using goal and details of shot information. Furthermore, we show HPUS examples in analyzing possessions, matches, and between matches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Miscommunication and communication challenges between instructors and students represents one of the primary barriers to post-secondary learning. Students often avoid or miss opportunities to ask questions during office hours due to insecurities or scheduling conflicts. Moreover, students need to work at their own pace to have the freedom and time for the self-contemplation needed to build conceptual understanding and develop creative thinking skills. To eliminate barriers to student engagement, academic institutions need to redefine their fundamental approach to education by proposing flexible educational pathways that recognize continuous learning. To this end, we developed an AI-augmented intelligent educational assistance framework based on a power language model (i.e., GPT-3) that automatically generates course-specific intelligent assistants regardless of discipline or academic level. The virtual intelligent teaching assistant (TA) system will serve as a voice-enabled helper capable of answering course-specific questions concerning curriculum, logistics and course policies. It is envisioned to improve access to course-related information for the students and reduce logistical workload for the instructors and TAs. Its GPT-3-based knowledge discovery component as well as the generalized system architecture is presented accompanied by a methodical evaluation of the system accuracy and performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Prompting has become an important mechanism by which users can more effectively interact with many flavors of foundation model. Indeed, the last several years have shown that well-honed prompts can sometimes unlock emergent capabilities within such models. While there has been a substantial amount of empirical exploration of prompting within the community, relatively few works have studied prompting at a mathematical level. In this work we aim to take a first step towards understanding basic geometric properties induced by prompts in Stable Diffusion, focusing on the intrinsic dimension of internal representations within the model. We find that choice of prompt has a substantial impact on the intrinsic dimension of representations at both layers of the model which we explored, but that the nature of this impact depends on the layer being considered. For example, in certain bottleneck layers of the model, intrinsic dimension of representations is correlated with prompt perplexity (measured using a surrogate model), while this correlation is not apparent in the latent layers. Our evidence suggests that intrinsic dimension could be a useful tool for future studies of the impact of different prompts on text-to-image models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper we present a set of experiments carried out with BERT on a number of Italian sentences taken from poetry domain. The experiments are organized on the hypothesis of a very high level of difficulty in predictability at the three levels of linguistic complexity that we intend to monitor: lexical, syntactic and semantic level. To test this hypothesis we ran the Italian version of BERT with 80 sentences for a total of 900 tokens mostly extracted from Italian poetry of the first half of last century. Then we alternated canonical and noncanonical versions of the same sentence before processing them with the same DL model. We used then sentences from the newswire domain containing similar syntactic structures. The results show that the DL model is highly sensitive to presence of noncanonical structures. However, DLs are also very sensitive to word frequency and to local non literal meaning compositional effect. This is also apparent by the preference for predicting function vs content words, collocates vs infrequent word phrases. In the paper, we focused our attention on the use of subword units done by BERT for out of vocabulary words. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The field of natural language processing has reached breakthroughs with the advent of transformers. They have remained state-of-the-art since then, and there also has been much research in analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating the attention layers and the underlying embedding space. In addition to the self-attention layers, the feed-forward layers in the transformer are a prominent architectural component. From extensive research, we observe that its role is under-explored. We focus on the latent space, known as the Activation Space, that consists of the neuron activations from these feed-forward layers. In this survey paper, we review interpretability methods that examine the learnings that occurred in this activation space. Since there exists only limited research in this direction, we conduct a detailed examination of each work and point out potential future directions of research. We hope our work provides a step towards strengthening activation space analysis. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) is a recently emerging task that tackles few-shot learning across different domains. It aims at transferring prior knowledge learned on the source dataset to novel target datasets. The CD-FSL task is especially challenged by the huge domain gap between different datasets. Critically, such a domain gap actually comes from the changes of visual styles, and wave-SAN empirically shows that spanning the style distribution of the source data helps alleviate this issue. However, wave-SAN simply swaps styles of two images. Such a vanilla operation makes the generated styles ``real'' and ``easy'', which still fall into the original set of the source styles. Thus, inspired by vanilla adversarial learning, a novel model-agnostic meta Style Adversarial training (StyleAdv) method together with a novel style adversarial attack method is proposed for CD-FSL. Particularly, our style attack method synthesizes both ``virtual'' and ``hard'' adversarial styles for model training. This is achieved by perturbing the original style with the signed style gradients. By continually attacking styles and forcing the model to recognize these challenging adversarial styles, our model is gradually robust to the visual styles, thus boosting the generalization ability for novel target datasets. Besides the typical CNN-based backbone, we also employ our StyleAdv method on large-scale pretrained vision transformer. Extensive experiments conducted on eight various target datasets show the effectiveness of our method. Whether built upon ResNet or ViT, we achieve the new state of the art for CD-FSL. Codes and models will be released. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a method based on the training of two neural networks, one called generator and the other discriminator, competing with each other to generate new instances that resemble those of the probability distribution of the training data. GANs have a wide range of applications in fields such as computer vision, semantic segmentation, time series synthesis, image editing, natural language processing, and image generation from text, among others. Generative models model the probability distribution of a data set, but instead of providing a probability value, they generate new instances that are close to the original distribution. GANs use a learning scheme that allows the defining attributes of the probability distribution to be encoded in a neural network, allowing instances to be generated that resemble the original probability distribution. This article presents the theoretical foundations of this type of network as well as the basic architecture schemes and some of its applications.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Autoencoding has achieved great empirical success as a framework for learning generative models for natural images. Autoencoders often use generic deep networks as the encoder or decoder, which are difficult to interpret, and the learned representations lack clear structure. In this work, we make the explicit assumption that the image distribution is generated from a multi-stage sparse deconvolution. The corresponding inverse map, which we use as an encoder, is a multi-stage convolution sparse coding (CSC), with each stage obtained from unrolling an optimization algorithm for solving the corresponding (convexified) sparse coding program. To avoid computational difficulties in minimizing distributional distance between the real and generated images, we utilize the recent closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework that optimizes the rate reduction of the learned sparse representations. Conceptually, our method has high-level connections to score-matching methods such as diffusion models. Empirically, our framework demonstrates competitive performance on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K, compared to existing autoencoding and generative methods under fair conditions. Even with simpler networks and fewer computational resources, our method demonstrates high visual quality in regenerated images. More surprisingly, the learned autoencoder performs well on unseen datasets. Our method enjoys several side benefits, including more structured and interpretable representations, more stable convergence, and scalability to large datasets. Our method is arguably the first to demonstrate that a concatenation of multiple convolution sparse coding/decoding layers leads to an interpretable and effective autoencoder for modeling the distribution of large-scale natural image datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce a task consisting in matching a proof to a given mathematical statement. The task fits well within current research on Mathematical Information Retrieval and, more generally, mathematical article analysis (Mathematical Sciences, 2014). We present a dataset for the task (the MATcH dataset) consisting of over 180k statement-proof pairs extracted from modern mathematical research articles. We find this dataset highly representative of our task, as it consists of relatively new findings useful to mathematicians. We propose a bilinear similarity model and two decoding methods to match statements to proofs effectively. While the first decoding method matches a proof to a statement without being aware of other statements or proofs, the second method treats the task as a global matching problem. Through a symbol replacement procedure, we analyze the "insights" that pre-trained language models have in such mathematical article analysis and show that while these models perform well on this task with the best performing mean reciprocal rank of 73.7, they follow a relatively shallow symbolic analysis and matching to achieve that performance. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) of transient partial differential equations are typically obtained by performing a dimension reduction and projection process that is defined at either the spatially continuous or spatially discrete level. In both cases, it is common to add stabilization to the resulting ROM to increase the stability and accuracy of the method; the addition of stabilization is particularly common for advection-dominated systems when the ROM is under-resolved. While these two approaches can be equivalent in certain settings, differing techniques have emerged in both contexts. This work outlines these two approaches within the setting of finite element method (FEM) discretizations (in which case a duality exists between the continuous and discrete levels) of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation, and compares residual-based stabilization techniques that have been developed in both contexts. In the spatially continuous case, we examine the Galerkin, streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG), Galerkin/least-squares (GLS), and adjoint (ADJ) stabilization methods. For the GLS and ADJ methods, we examine formulations constructed from both the "discretize-then-stabilize" technique and the space-time technique. In the spatially discrete case, we examine the Galerkin, least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG), and adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) methods. We summarize existing analyses for these methods, and provide numerical experiments, which demonstrate that residual-based stabilized methods developed via continuous and discrete processes yield substantial improvements over standard Galerkin methods when the underlying FEM model is under-resolved. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we point out that the essential differences between CNN-based and Transformer-based detectors, which cause the worse performance of small objects in Transformer-based methods, are the gap between local information and global dependencies in feature extraction and propagation. To address these differences, we propose a new vision Transformer, called Hybrid Network Transformer (Hyneter), after pre-experiments that indicate the gap causes CNN-based and Transformer-based methods to increase size-different objects result unevenly. Different from the divide and conquer strategy in previous methods, Hyneters consist of Hybrid Network Backbone (HNB) and Dual Switching module (DS), which integrate local information and global dependencies, and transfer them simultaneously. Based on the balance strategy, HNB extends the range of local information by embedding convolution layers into Transformer blocks, and DS adjusts excessive reliance on global dependencies outside the patch. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion-based generative models are a design framework that allows generating new images from processes analogous to those found in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. These models model the reversal of a physical diffusion process in which two miscible liquids of different colors progressively mix until they form a homogeneous mixture. Diffusion models can be applied to signals of a different nature, such as audio and image signals. In the image case, a progressive pixel corruption process is carried out by applying random noise, and a neural network is trained to revert each one of the corruption steps. For the reconstruction process to be reversible, it is necessary to carry out the corruption very progressively. If the training of the neural network is successful, it will be possible to generate an image from random noise by chaining a number of steps similar to those used for image deconstruction at training time. In this article we present the theoretical foundations on which this method is based as well as some of its applications.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Thermal facial imagery offers valuable insight into physiological states such as inflammation and stress by detecting emitted radiation in the infrared spectrum, which is unseen in the visible spectra. Telemedicine applications could benefit from thermal imagery, but conventional computers are reliant on RGB cameras and lack thermal sensors. As a result, we propose the Visible-to-Thermal Facial GAN (VTF-GAN) that is specifically designed to generate high-resolution thermal faces by learning both the spatial and frequency domains of facial regions, across spectra. We compare VTF-GAN against several popular GAN baselines and the first conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for VT face translation (VTF-Diff). Results show that VTF-GAN achieves high quality, crisp, and perceptually realistic thermal faces using a combined set of patch, temperature, perceptual, and Fourier Transform losses, compared to all baselines including diffusion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Semantic face image manipulation has received increasing attention in recent years. StyleGAN-based approaches to face morphing are among the leading techniques; however, they often suffer from noticeable blurring and artifacts as a result of the uniform attention in the latent feature space. In this paper, we propose to develop a transformer-based alternative to face morphing and demonstrate its superiority to StyleGAN-based methods. Our contributions are threefold. First, inspired by GANformer, we introduce a bipartite structure to exploit long-range interactions in face images for iterative propagation of information from latent variables to salient facial features. Special loss functions are designed to support the optimization of face morphing. Second, we extend the study of transformer-based face morphing to demorphing by presenting an effective defense strategy with access to a reference image using the same generator of MorphGANFormer. Such demorphing is conceptually similar to unmixing of hyperspectral images but operates in the latent (instead of pixel) space. Third, for the first time, we address a fundamental issue of vulnerability-detectability trade-off for face morphing studies. It is argued that neither doppelganger norrandom pair selection is optimal, and a Lagrangian multiplier-based approach should be used to achieve an improved trade-off between recognition vulnerability and attack detectability. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) are regarded as the foundation for various downstream tasks with different data modalities. A pretrained foundation model, such as BERT, GPT-3, MAE, DALLE-E, and ChatGPT, is trained on large-scale data which provides a reasonable parameter initialization for a wide range of downstream applications. The idea of pretraining behind PFMs plays an important role in the application of large models. Different from previous methods that apply convolution and recurrent modules for feature extractions, the generative pre-training (GPT) method applies Transformer as the feature extractor and is trained on large datasets with an autoregressive paradigm. Similarly, the BERT apples transformers to train on large datasets as a contextual language model. Recently, the ChatGPT shows promising success on large language models, which applies an autoregressive language model with zero shot or few show prompting. With the extraordinary success of PFMs, AI has made waves in a variety of fields over the past few years. Considerable methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, the need is raising for an updated survey. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent research advancements, current and future challenges, and opportunities for PFMs in text, image, graph, as well as other data modalities. We first review the basic components and existing pretraining in natural language processing, computer vision, and graph learning. We then discuss other advanced PFMs for other data modalities and unified PFMs considering the data quality and quantity. Besides, we discuss relevant research about the fundamentals of the PFM, including model efficiency and compression, security, and privacy. Finally, we lay out key implications, future research directions, challenges, and open problems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel perspective of the attention mechanism by reinventing it as a memory architecture for neural networks, namely Neural Attention Memory (NAM). NAM is a memory structure that is both readable and writable via differentiable linear algebra operations. We explore three use cases of NAM: memory-augmented neural network (MANN), few-shot learning, and efficient long-range attention. First, we design two NAM-based MANNs of Long Short-term Memory (LSAM) and NAM Turing Machine (NAM-TM) that show better computational powers in algorithmic zero-shot generalization tasks compared to other baselines such as differentiable neural computer (DNC). Next, we apply NAM to the N-way K-shot learning task and show that it is more effective at reducing false positives compared to the baseline cosine classifier. Finally, we implement an efficient Transformer with NAM and evaluate it with long-range arena tasks to show that NAM can be an efficient and effective alternative for scaled dot-product attention. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization is an emerging embedded application domain that leverages existing Wi-Fi access points (APs) in buildings to localize users with smartphones. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of wireless transceivers across diverse smartphones carried by users has been shown to reduce the accuracy and reliability of localization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on vision transformer neural networks called VITAL that addresses this important challenge. Experiments indicate that VITAL can reduce the uncertainty created by smartphone heterogeneity while improving localization accuracy from 41% to 68% over the best-known prior works. We also demonstrate the generalizability of our approach and propose a data augmentation technique that can be integrated into most deep learning-based localization frameworks to improve accuracy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We study the problem of estimating the distribution of the return of a policy using an offline dataset that is not generated from the policy, i.e., distributional offline policy evaluation (OPE). We propose an algorithm called Fitted Likelihood Estimation (FLE), which conducts a sequence of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problems and has the flexibility of integrating any state-of-art probabilistic generative models as long as it can be trained via MLE. FLE can be used for both finite horizon and infinite horizon discounted settings where rewards can be multi-dimensional vectors. In our theoretical results, we show that for both finite and infinite horizon discounted settings, FLE can learn distributions that are close to the ground truth under total variation distance and Wasserstein distance, respectively. Our theoretical results hold under the conditions that the offline data covers the test policy's traces and the supervised learning MLE procedures succeed. Experimentally, we demonstrate the performance of FLE with two generative models, Gaussian mixture models and diffusion models. For the multi-dimensional reward setting, FLE with diffusion models is capable of estimating the complicated distribution of the return of a test policy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer architectures have achieved great success in solving natural language tasks, which learn strong language representations from large-scale unlabeled texts. In this paper, we seek to go further beyond and explore a new logical inductive bias for better language representation learning. Logic reasoning is known as a formal methodology to reach answers from given knowledge and facts. Inspired by such a view, we develop a novel neural architecture named FOLNet (First-Order Logic Network), to encode this new inductive bias. We construct a set of neural logic operators as learnable Horn clauses, which are further forward-chained into a fully differentiable neural architecture (FOLNet). Interestingly, we find that the self-attention module in transformers can be composed by two of our neural logic operators, which probably explains their strong reasoning performance. Our proposed FOLNet has the same input and output interfaces as other pretrained models and thus could be pretrained/finetuned by using similar losses. It also allows FOLNet to be used in a plug-and-play manner when replacing other pretrained models. With our logical inductive bias, the same set of ``logic deduction skills'' learned through pretraining are expected to be equally capable of solving diverse downstream tasks. For this reason, FOLNet learns language representations that have much stronger transfer capabilities. Experimental results on several language understanding tasks show that our pretrained FOLNet model outperforms the existing strong transformer-based approaches. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced existing medical systems for automatic disease diagnosis. However, there are still concerns about the reliability of deep medical diagnosis systems against the potential threats of adversarial attacks since inaccurate diagnosis could lead to disastrous consequences in the safety realm. In this study, we propose a highly robust yet efficient CNN-Transformer hybrid model which is equipped with the locality of CNNs as well as the global connectivity of vision Transformers. To mitigate the high quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism while jointly attending to information in various representation subspaces, we construct our attention mechanism by means of an efficient convolution operation. Moreover, to alleviate the fragility of our Transformer model against adversarial attacks, we attempt to learn smoother decision boundaries. To this end, we augment the shape information of an image in the high-level feature space by permuting the feature mean and variance within mini-batches. With less computational complexity, our proposed hybrid model demonstrates its high robustness and generalization ability compared to the state-of-the-art studies on a large-scale collection of standardized MedMNIST-2D datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: GAN inversion has been exploited in many face manipulation tasks, but 2D GANs often fail to generate multi-view 3D consistent images. The encoders designed for 2D GANs are not able to provide sufficient 3D information for the inversion and editing. Therefore, 3D-aware GAN inversion is proposed to increase the 3D editing capability of GANs. However, the 3D-aware GAN inversion remains under-explored. To tackle this problem, we propose a 3D-aware (3Da) encoder for GAN inversion and face editing based on the powerful StyleNeRF model. Our proposed 3Da encoder combines a parametric 3D face model with a learnable detail representation model to generate geometry, texture and view direction codes. For more flexible face manipulation, we then design a dual-branch StyleFlow module to transfer the StyleNeRF codes with disentangled geometry and texture flows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we realize 3D consistent face manipulation in both facial attribute editing and texture transfer. Furthermore, for video editing, we make the sequence of frame codes share a common canonical manifold, which improves the temporal consistency of the edited attributes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: 3D face generation has achieved high visual quality and 3D consistency thanks to the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Recently, to generate and edit 3D faces with NeRF representation, some methods are proposed and achieve good results in decoupling geometry and texture. The latent codes of these generative models affect the whole face, and hence modifications to these codes cause the entire face to change. However, users usually edit a local region when editing faces and do not want other regions to be affected. Since changes to the latent code affect global generation results, these methods do not allow for fine-grained control of local facial regions. To improve local controllability in NeRF-based face editing, we propose LC-NeRF, which is composed of a Local Region Generators Module and a Spatial-Aware Fusion Module, allowing for local geometry and texture control of local facial regions. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method provides better local editing than state-of-the-art face editing methods. Our method also performs well in downstream tasks, such as text-driven facial image editing. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The promising research on Artificial Intelligence usages in suicide prevention has principal gaps, including black box methodologies, inadequate outcome measures, and scarce research on non-verbal inputs, such as social media images (despite their popularity today, in our digital era). This study addresses these gaps and combines theory-driven and bottom-up strategies to construct a hybrid and interpretable prediction model of valid suicide risk from images. The lead hypothesis was that images contain valuable information about emotions and interpersonal relationships, two central concepts in suicide-related treatments and theories. The dataset included 177,220 images by 841 Facebook users who completed a gold-standard suicide scale. The images were represented with CLIP, a state-of-the-art algorithm, which was utilized, unconventionally, to extract predefined features that served as inputs to a simple logistic-regression prediction model (in contrast to complex neural networks). The features addressed basic and theory-driven visual elements using everyday language (e.g., bright photo, photo of sad people). The results of the hybrid model (that integrated theory-driven and bottom-up methods) indicated high prediction performance that surpassed common bottom-up algorithms, thus providing a first proof that images (alone) can be leveraged to predict validated suicide risk. Corresponding with the lead hypothesis, at-risk users had images with increased negative emotions and decreased belonginess. The results are discussed in the context of non-verbal warning signs of suicide. Notably, the study illustrates the advantages of hybrid models in such complicated tasks and provides simple and flexible prediction strategies that could be utilized to develop real-life monitoring tools of suicide. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution,with a few frequent labels and a lot of few-shot labels. The study of institution name normalization is a perfect application case showing this phenomenon. There are many institutions worldwide with enormous variations of their names in the publicly available literature. In this work, we first collect a large-scale institution name normalization dataset LoT-insts1, which contains over 25k classes that exhibit a naturally long-tailed distribution. In order to isolate the few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios from the massive many-shot classes, we construct our test set from four different subsets: many-, medium-, and few-shot sets, as well as a zero-shot open set. We also replicate several important baseline methods on our data, covering a wide range from search-based methods to neural network methods that use the pretrained BERT model. Further, we propose our specially pretrained, BERT-based model that shows better out-of-distribution generalization on few-shot and zero-shot test sets. Compared to other datasets focusing on the long-tailed phenomenon, our dataset has one order of magnitude more training data than the largest existing long-tailed datasets and is naturally long-tailed rather than manually synthesized. We believe it provides an important and different scenario to study this problem. To our best knowledge, this is the first natural language dataset that focuses on long-tailed and open-set classification problems. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The study compares the performance of these generated datasets with English named entity recognition systems and provides insights into the effectiveness of machine translation for this task. Additionally, this approach could be used to augment data in low-resource language or create noisy data to make named entity systems more robust and improve them. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

As a result, predicting a patient's ventilator pressure is essential when designing a simulation ventilator. We suggested a hybrid deep learning-based approach to forecast required ventilator pressure for patients. This system is made up of Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU networks. The SELU activation function was used in our proposed model. MAE and MSE were used to examine the accuracy of the proposed model so that our proposed methodology can be applied to real-world problems. The model performed well against test data and created far too few losses. Major parts of our research were data collection, data analysis, data cleaning, building hybrid Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU model, training the model, model evaluation, and result analysis. We compared the results of our research with some contemporary works, and our proposed model performed better than those models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Unsupervised meta-learning aims to learn the meta knowledge from unlabeled data and rapidly adapt to novel tasks. However, existing approaches may be misled by the context-bias (e.g. background) from the training data. In this paper, we abstract the unsupervised meta-learning problem into a Structural Causal Model (SCM) and point out that such bias arises due to hidden confounders. To eliminate the confounders, we define the priors are \textit{conditionally} independent, learn the relationships between priors and intervene on them with casual factorization. Furthermore, we propose Causal Meta VAE (CMVAE) that encodes the priors into latent codes in the causal space and learns their relationships simultaneously to achieve the downstream few-shot image classification task. Results on toy datasets and three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can remove the context-bias and it outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised meta-learning algorithms because of bias-removal.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Spatiotemporal data mining plays an important role in air quality monitoring, crowd flow modeling, and climate forecasting. However, the originally collected spatiotemporal data in real-world scenarios is usually incomplete due to sensor failures or transmission loss. Spatiotemporal imputation aims to fill the missing values according to the observed values and the underlying spatiotemporal dependence of them. The previous dominant models impute missing values autoregressively and suffer from the problem of error accumulation. As emerging powerful generative models, the diffusion probabilistic models can be adopted to impute missing values conditioned by observations and avoid inferring missing values from inaccurate historical imputation. However, the construction and utilization of conditional information are inevitable challenges when applying diffusion models to spatiotemporal imputation. To address above issues, we propose a conditional diffusion framework for spatiotemporal imputation with enhanced prior modeling, named PriSTI. Our proposed framework provides a conditional feature extraction module first to extract the coarse yet effective spatiotemporal dependencies from conditional information as the global context prior. Then, a noise estimation module transforms random noise to realistic values, with the spatiotemporal attention weights calculated by the conditional feature, as well as the consideration of geographic relationships. PriSTI outperforms existing imputation methods in various missing patterns of different real-world spatiotemporal data, and effectively handles scenarios such as high missing rates and sensor failure.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent large-scale generative models learned on big data are capable of synthesizing incredible images yet suffer from limited controllability. This work offers a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of the output image, such as spatial layout and palette, while maintaining the synthesis quality and model creativity. With compositionality as the core idea, we first decompose an image into representative factors, and then train a diffusion model with all these factors as the conditions to recompose the input. At the inference stage, the rich intermediate representations work as composable elements, leading to a huge design space (i.e., exponentially proportional to the number of decomposed factors) for customizable content creation. It is noteworthy that our approach, which we call Composer, supports various levels of conditions, such as text description as the global information, depth map and sketch as the local guidance, color histogram for low-level details, etc. Besides improving controllability, we confirm that Composer serves as a general framework and facilitates a wide range of classical generative tasks without retraining. Code and models will be made available. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Model inversion (MI) attacks have raised increasing concerns about privacy, which can reconstruct training data from public models. Indeed, MI attacks can be formalized as an optimization problem that seeks private data in a certain space. Recent MI attacks leverage a generative adversarial network (GAN) as an image prior to narrow the search space, and can successfully reconstruct even the high-dimensional data (e.g., face images). However, these generative MI attacks do not fully exploit the potential capabilities of the target model, still leading to a vague and coupled search space, i.e., different classes of images are coupled in the search space. Besides, the widely used cross-entropy loss in these attacks suffers from gradient vanishing. To address these problems, we propose Pseudo Label-Guided MI (PLG-MI) attack via conditional GAN (cGAN). At first, a top-n selection strategy is proposed to provide pseudo-labels for public data, and use pseudo-labels to guide the training of the cGAN. In this way, the search space is decoupled for different classes of images. Then a max-margin loss is introduced to improve the search process on the subspace of a target class. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PLG-MI attack significantly improves the attack success rate and visual quality for various datasets and models, notably, 2~3 $\times$ better than state-of-the-art attacks under large distributional shifts.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning-based algorithms, e.g., convolutional networks, have significantly facilitated multivariate time series classification (MTSC) task. Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence due to the nature of convolution operations. Recent advancements have shown the potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant and quadratic time complexity, with transformers directly applicable to the MTSC task because of the distinct properties of time series data. To tackle these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed. To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and (3) tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments performed on $10$ publicly available datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the FormerTime compared to previous competitive baselines. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper we derive the dynamic equations of a race-car model via Lie-group methods. Lie-group methods are nowadays quite familiar to computational dynamicists and roboticists, but their diffusion within the vehicle dynamics community is still limited. We try to bridge this gap by showing that this framework merges gracefully with the Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA) and enables a fresh and systematic formulation of the vehicle dynamics. A significant contribution is represented by a rigorous reconciliation of the ABA steps with the salient features of vehicle dynamics, such as road-tire interactions, aerodynamic forces and load transfers. The proposed approach lends itself both to the definition of direct simulation models and to the systematic assembly of vehicle dynamics equations required, in the form of equality constraints, in numerical optimal control problems. We put our approach on a test in the latter context which involves the solution of minimum lap-time problem (MLTP). More specifically, a MLTP for a race car on the N\"urburgring circuit is systematically set up with our approach. The equations are then discretized with the direct collocation method and solved within the CasADi optimization suite. Both the quality of the solution and the computational efficiency demonstrate the validity of the presented approach. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In recent years, self-supervised monocular depth estimation has drawn much attention since it frees of depth annotations and achieved remarkable results on standard benchmarks. However, most of existing methods only focus on either daytime or nighttime images, thus their performance degrades on the other domain because of the large domain shift between daytime and nighttime images. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a two-branch network named GlocalFuse-Depth for self-supervised depth estimation of all-day images. The daytime and nighttime image in input image pair are fed into the two branches: CNN branch and Transformer branch, respectively, where both fine-grained details and global dependency can be efficiently captured. Besides, a novel fusion module is proposed to fuse multi-dimensional features from the two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GlocalFuse-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results for all-day images on the Oxford RobotCar dataset, which proves the superiority of our method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Relation tuple extraction from text is an important task for building knowledge bases. Recently, joint entity and relation extraction models have achieved very high F1 scores in this task. However, the experimental settings used by these models are restrictive and the datasets used in the experiments are not realistic. They do not include sentences with zero tuples (zero-cardinality). In this paper, we evaluate the state-of-the-art joint entity and relation extraction models in a more realistic setting. We include sentences that do not contain any tuples in our experiments. Our experiments show that there is significant drop ($\sim 10-15\%$ in one dataset and $\sim 6-14\%$ in another dataset) in their F1 score in this setting. We also propose a two-step modeling using a simple BERT-based classifier that leads to improvement in the overall performance of these models in this realistic experimental setup. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Evaluation in Information Retrieval relies on post-hoc empirical procedures, which are time-consuming and expensive operations. To alleviate this, Query Performance Prediction (QPP) models have been developed to estimate the performance of a system without the need for human-made relevance judgements. Such models, usually relying on lexical features from queries and corpora, have been applied to traditional sparse IR methods - with various degrees of success. With the advent of neural IR and large Pre-trained Language Models, the retrieval paradigm has significantly shifted towards more semantic signals. In this work, we study and analyze to what extent current QPP models can predict the performance of such systems. Our experiments consider seven traditional bag-of-words and seven BERT-based IR approaches, as well as nineteen state-of-the-art QPPs evaluated on two collections, Deep Learning '19 and Robust '04. Our findings show that QPPs perform statistically significantly worse on neural IR systems. In settings where semantic signals are prominent (e.g., passage retrieval), their performance on neural models drops by as much as 10% compared to bag-of-words approaches. On top of that, in lexical-oriented scenarios, QPPs fail to predict performance for neural IR systems on those queries where they differ from traditional approaches the most. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are among the most popular likelihood-based generative models. There is rather a consensus that the top-down hierarchical VAEs allow to effectively learn deep latent structures and avoid problems like the posterior collapse. Here, we show that it is not necessarily the case and the problem of collapsing posteriors remains. To discourage the posterior collapse, we propose a new deep hierarchical VAE with a partly fixed encoder, specifically, we use Discrete Cosine Transform to obtain top latent variables. In a series of experiments, we observe that the proposed modification allows us to achieve better utilization of the latent space. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can be useful for compression and robustness to adversarial attacks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The goal of video motion magnification techniques is to magnify small motions in a video to reveal previously invisible or unseen movement. Its uses extend from bio-medical applications and deep fake detection to structural modal analysis and predictive maintenance. However, discerning small motion from noise is a complex task, especially when attempting to magnify very subtle often sub-pixel movement. As a result, motion magnification techniques generally suffer from noisy and blurry outputs. This work presents a new state-of-the-art model based on the Swin Transformer, which offers better tolerance to noisy inputs as well as higher-quality outputs that exhibit less noise, blurriness and artifacts than prior-art. Improvements in output image quality will enable more precise measurements for any application reliant on magnified video sequences, and may enable further development of video motion magnification techniques in new technical fields. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer-based machine learning models have become an essential tool for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks since the introduction of the method. A common objective of these projects is to classify text data. Classification models are often extended to a different topic and/or time period. In these situations, deciding how long a classification is suitable for and when it is worth re-training our model is difficult. This paper compares different approaches to fine-tune a BERT model for a long-running classification task. We use data from different periods to fine-tune our original BERT model, and we also measure how a second round of annotation could boost the classification quality. Our corpus contains over 8 million comments on COVID-19 vaccination in Hungary posted between September 2020 and December 2021. Our results show that the best solution is using all available unlabeled comments to fine-tune a model. It is not advisable to focus only on comments containing words that our model has not encountered before; a more efficient solution is randomly sample comments from the new period. Fine-tuning does not prevent the model from losing performance but merely slows it down. In a rapidly changing linguistic environment, it is not possible to maintain model performance without regularly annotating new text. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: While diffusion models have achieved great success in generating continuous signals such as images and audio, it remains elusive for diffusion models in learning discrete sequence data like natural languages. Although recent advances circumvent this challenge of discreteness by embedding discrete tokens as continuous surrogates, they still fall short of satisfactory generation quality. To understand this, we first dive deep into the denoised training protocol of diffusion-based sequence generative models and determine their three severe problems, i.e., 1) failing to learn, 2) lack of scalability, and 3) neglecting source conditions. We argue that these problems can be boiled down to the pitfall of the not completely eliminated discreteness in the embedding space, and the scale of noises is decisive herein. In this paper, we introduce DINOISER to facilitate diffusion models for sequence generation by manipulating noises. We propose to adaptively determine the range of sampled noise scales for counter-discreteness training; and encourage the proposed diffused sequence learner to leverage source conditions with amplified noise scales during inference. Experiments show that DINOISER enables consistent improvement over the baselines of previous diffusion-based sequence generative models on several conditional sequence modeling benchmarks thanks to both effective training and inference strategies. Analyses further verify that DINOISER can make better use of source conditions to govern its generative process. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big models are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of these models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language processing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of these models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh researchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly introduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the conventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process, computer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key challenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and discuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures, and knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream tasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative, classification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis of the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks. Finally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may benefit future works. In addition, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for large-scale pre-trained multi-modal big models: https://github.com/wangxiao5791509/MultiModal_BigModels_Survey <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

Traditional friend recall methods focus on rules like friend intimacy or training a classifier for predicting lost players' return probability, but ignore feature information of (active) players and historical friend recall events. In this work, we treat friend recall as a link prediction problem and explore several link prediction methods which can use features of both active and lost players, as well as historical events. Furthermore, we propose a novel Edge Transformer model and pre-train the model via masked auto-encoders.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Novel view synthesis from a single image requires inferring occluded regions of objects and scenes whilst simultaneously maintaining semantic and physical consistency with the input. Existing approaches condition neural radiance fields (NeRF) on local image features, projecting points to the input image plane, and aggregating 2D features to perform volume rendering. However, under severe occlusion, this projection fails to resolve uncertainty, resulting in blurry renderings that lack details. In this work, we propose NerfDiff, which addresses this issue by distilling the knowledge of a 3D-aware conditional diffusion model (CDM) into NeRF through synthesizing and refining a set of virtual views at test time. We further propose a novel NeRF-guided distillation algorithm that simultaneously generates 3D consistent virtual views from the CDM samples, and finetunes the NeRF based on the improved virtual views. Our approach significantly outperforms existing NeRF-based and geometry-free approaches on challenging datasets, including ShapeNet, ABO, and Clevr3D. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Reconstructing images using brain signals of imagined visuals may provide an augmented vision to the disabled, leading to the advancement of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. The recent progress in deep learning has boosted the study area of synthesizing images from brain signals using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this work, we have proposed a framework for synthesizing the images from the brain activity recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG) using small-size EEG datasets. This brain activity is recorded from the subject's head scalp using EEG when they ask to visualize certain classes of Objects and English characters. We use a contrastive learning method in the proposed framework to extract features from EEG signals and synthesize the images from extracted features using conditional GAN. We modify the loss function to train the GAN, which enables it to synthesize 128x128 images using a small number of images. Further, we conduct ablation studies and experiments to show the effectiveness of our proposed framework over other state-of-the-art methods using the small EEG dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion models have enabled high-quality, conditional image editing capabilities. We propose to expand their arsenal, and demonstrate that off-the-shelf diffusion models can be used for a wide range of cross-domain compositing tasks. Among numerous others, these include image blending, object immersion, texture-replacement and even CG2Real translation or stylization. We employ a localized, iterative refinement scheme which infuses the injected objects with contextual information derived from the background scene, and enables control over the degree and types of changes the object may undergo. We conduct a range of qualitative and quantitative comparisons to prior work, and exhibit that our method produces higher quality and realistic results without requiring any annotations or training. Finally, we demonstrate how our method may be used for data augmentation of downstream tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With generative models proliferating at a rapid rate, there is a growing need for general purpose fake image detectors. In this work, we first show that the existing paradigm, which consists of training a deep network for real-vs-fake classification, fails to detect fake images from newer breeds of generative models when trained to detect GAN fake images. Upon analysis, we find that the resulting classifier is asymmetrically tuned to detect patterns that make an image fake. The real class becomes a sink class holding anything that is not fake, including generated images from models not accessible during training. Building upon this discovery, we propose to perform real-vs-fake classification without learning; i.e., using a feature space not explicitly trained to distinguish real from fake images. We use nearest neighbor and linear probing as instantiations of this idea. When given access to the feature space of a large pretrained vision-language model, the very simple baseline of nearest neighbor classification has surprisingly good generalization ability in detecting fake images from a wide variety of generative models; e.g., it improves upon the SoTA by +15.07 mAP and +25.90% acc when tested on unseen diffusion and autoregressive models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep neural networks have revolutionized the field of supervised learning by enabling accurate predictions through learning from large annotated datasets. However, acquiring large annotated medical imaging datasets is a challenging task, especially for rare diseases, due to the high cost, time, and effort required for annotation. In these scenarios, unsupervised disease detection methods, such as anomaly detection, can save significant human effort. A typically used approach for anomaly detection is to learn the images from healthy subjects only, assuming the model will detect the images from diseased subjects as outliers. However, in many real-world scenarios, unannotated datasets with a mix of healthy and diseased individuals are available. Recent studies have shown improvement in unsupervised disease/anomaly detection using such datasets of unannotated images from healthy and diseased individuals compared to datasets that only include images from healthy individuals. A major issue remains unaddressed in these studies, which is selecting the best model for inference from a set of trained models without annotated samples. To address this issue, we propose Brainomaly, a GAN-based image-to-image translation method for neurologic disease detection using unannotated T1-weighted brain MRIs of individuals with neurologic diseases and healthy subjects. Brainomaly is trained to remove the diseased regions from the input brain MRIs and generate MRIs of corresponding healthy brains. Instead of generating the healthy images directly, Brainomaly generates an additive map where each voxel indicates the amount of changes required to make the input image look healthy. In addition, Brainomaly uses a pseudo-AUC metric for inference model selection, which further improves the detection performance. Our Brainomaly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We investigate recent transformer networks pre-trained for automatic speech recognition for their ability to detect speaker and language changes in speech. We do this by simply adding speaker (change) or language targets to the labels. For Wav2vec2 pre-trained networks, we also investigate if the representation for the speaker change symbol can be conditioned to capture speaker identity characteristics. Using a number of constructed data sets we show that these capabilities are definitely there, with speaker recognition equal error rates of the order of 10% and language detection error rates of a few percent. We will publish the code for reproducibility. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Synthetic polyp generation is a good alternative to overcome the privacy problem of medical data and the lack of various polyp samples. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based polyp image generation framework that generates synthetic polyp images that are similar to real ones. We suggest a framework that converts a given polyp image into a negative image (image without a polyp) using a simple conditional GAN architecture and then converts the negative image into a new-looking polyp image using the same network. In addition, by using the controllable polyp masks, polyps with various characteristics can be generated from one input condition. The generated polyp images can be used directly as training images for polyp detection and segmentation without additional labeling. To quantitatively assess the quality of generated synthetic polyps, we use public polyp image and video datasets combined with the generated synthetic images to examine the performance improvement of several detection and segmentation models. Experimental results show that we obtain performance gains when the generated polyp images are added to the training set. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Turbulent flow consists of structures with a wide range of spatial and temporal scales which are hard to resolve numerically. Classical numerical methods as the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are able to capture fine details of turbulent structures but come at high computational cost. Applying generative adversarial networks (GAN) for the synthetic modeling of turbulence is a mathematically well-founded approach to overcome this issue. In this work, we investigate the generalization capabilites of GAN-based synthetic turbulence generators when geometrical changes occur in the flow configuration (e.g. aerodynamic geometric optimization of structures such as airfoils). As training data, we use the flow around a low-pressure turbine (LPT) stator with periodic wake impact obtained from highly resolved LES. To simulate the flow around a LPT stator, we use the conditional deep convolutional GAN framework pix2pixHD conditioned on the position of a rotating wake in front of the stator. For the generalization experiments we exclude images of wake positions located at certain regions from the training data and use the unseen data for testing. We show the abilities and limits of generalization for the conditional GAN by extending the regions of the extracted wake positions successively. Finally, we evaluate the statistical properties of the synthesized flow field by comparison with the corresponding LES results. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper we consider the filtering of partially observed multi-dimensional diffusion processes that are observed regularly at discrete times. We assume that, for numerical reasons, one has to time-discretize the diffusion process which typically leads to filtering that is subject to discretization bias. The approach in [16] establishes that when only having access to the time-discretized diffusion it is possible to remove the discretization bias with an estimator of finite variance. We improve on the method in [16] by introducing a modified estimator based on the recent work of [17]. We show that this new estimator is unbiased and has finite variance. Moreover, we conjecture and verify in numerical simulations that substantial gains are obtained. That is, for a given mean square error (MSE) and a particular class of multi-dimensional diffusion, the cost to achieve the said MSE falls. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We define diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions, and apply them to the generative modeling of functions. By first formulating such models in the infinite-dimensional limit and only then discretizing, we are able to obtain a sampling algorithm that has \emph{dimension-free} bounds on the distance from the sample measure to the target measure. Furthermore, we propose a new way to perform conditional sampling in an infinite-dimensional space and show that our approach outperforms previously suggested procedures. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
