        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a multilevel Monte Carlo-FEM algorithm to solve elliptic Bayesian inverse problems with "Besov random tree prior". These priors are given by a wavelet series with stochastic coefficients, and certain terms in the expansion vanishing at random, according to the law of so-called Galton-Watson trees. This allows to incorporate random fractal structures and large deviations in the log-diffusion, which occur naturally in many applications from geophysics or medical imaging. This framework entails two main difficulties: First, the associated diffusion coefficient does not satisfy a uniform ellipticity condition, which leads to non-integrable terms and thus divergence of standard multilevel estimators. Secondly, the associated space of parameters is Polish, but not a normed linear space. We address the first point by introducing cut-off functions in the estimator to compensate for the non-integrable terms, while the second issue is resolved by employing an independence Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting algorithm converges in the mean-square sense with essentially optimal asymptotic complexity, and dimension-independent acceptance probabilities. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Deep learning has made tremendous progress in the last decade. A key success factor is the large amount of architectures, layers, objectives, and optimization techniques that have emerged in recent years. They include a myriad of variants related to attention, normalization, skip connection, transformer and self-supervised learning schemes -- to name a few. We provide a comprehensive overview of the most important, recent works in these areas to those who already have a basic understanding of deep learning. We hope that a holistic and unified treatment of influential, recent works helps researchers to form new connections between diverse areas of deep learning. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In his monograph Chebyshev and Fourier Spectral Methods, John Boyd claimed that, regarding Fourier spectral methods for solving differential equations, ``[t]he virtues of the Fast Fourier Transform will continue to improve as the relentless march to larger and larger [bandwidths] continues''. This paper attempts to further the virtue of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as not only bandwidth is pushed to its limits, but also the dimension of the problem. Instead of using the traditional FFT however, we make a key substitution: a high-dimensional, sparse Fourier transform (SFT) paired with randomized rank-1 lattice methods. The resulting sparse spectral method rapidly and automatically determines a set of Fourier basis functions whose span is guaranteed to contain an accurate approximation of the solution of a given elliptic PDE. This much smaller, near-optimal Fourier basis is then used to efficiently solve the given PDE in a runtime which only depends on the PDE's data compressibility and ellipticity properties, while breaking the curse of dimensionality and relieving linear dependence on any multiscale structure in the original problem. Theoretical performance of the method is established herein with convergence analysis in the Sobolev norm for a general class of non-constant diffusion equations, as well as pointers to technical extensions of the convergence analysis to more general advection-diffusion-reaction equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate good empirical performance on several multiscale and high-dimensional example problems, further showcasing the promise of the proposed methods in practice. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The privacy preserving properties of Langevin dynamics with additive isotropic noise have been extensively studied. However, the isotropic noise assumption is very restrictive: (a) when adding noise to existing learning algorithms to preserve privacy and maintain the best possible accuracy one should take into account the relative magnitude of the outputs and their correlations; (b) popular algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (and their continuous time limits) appear to possess anisotropic covariance properties. To study the privacy risks for the anisotropic noise case, one requires general results on the relative entropy between the laws of two Stochastic Differential Equations with different drifts and diffusion coefficients. Our main contribution is to establish such a bound using stability estimates for solutions to the Fokker-Planck equations via functional inequalities. With additional assumptions, the relative entropy bound implies an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy bound. We discuss the practical implications of our bound related to privacy risk in different contexts.Finally, the benefits of anisotropic noise are illustrated using numerical results on optimising a quadratic loss or calibrating a neural network. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Obesity is a common issue in modern societies today that can lead to various diseases and significantly reduced quality of life. Currently, research has been conducted to investigate resting state EEG (electroencephalogram) signals with an aim to identify possible neurological characteristics associated with obesity. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based framework to extract the resting state EEG features for obese and lean subject classification. Specifically, a novel variational autoencoder framework is employed to extract subject-invariant features from the raw EEG signals, which are then classified by a 1-D convolutional neural network. Comparing with conventional machine learning and deep learning methods, we demonstrate the superiority of using VAE for feature extraction, as reflected by the significantly improved classification accuracies, better visualizations and reduced impurity measures in the feature representations. Future work can be directed to gaining an in-depth understanding regarding the spatial patterns that have been learned by the proposed model from a neurological view, as well as improving the interpretability of the proposed model by allowing it to uncover any temporal-related information. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) excel at synthesizing new views given multi-view, calibrated images of a static scene. When scenes include distractors, which are not persistent during image capture (moving objects, lighting variations, shadows), artifacts appear as view-dependent effects or 'floaters'. To cope with distractors, we advocate a form of robust estimation for NeRF training, modeling distractors in training data as outliers of an optimization problem. Our method successfully removes outliers from a scene and improves upon our baselines, on synthetic and real-world scenes. Our technique is simple to incorporate in modern NeRF frameworks, with few hyper-parameters. It does not assume a priori knowledge of the types of distractors, and is instead focused on the optimization problem rather than pre-processing or modeling transient objects.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Indonesian language is spoken by almost 200 million people and is the 10th most spoken language in the world, but it is under-represented in NLP (Natural Language Processing) research. A sparsity of language resources has hampered previous work on Indonesian. The Transformer is a new architecture rapidly becoming dominant for NLP, surpassing alternatives like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a Transformer model that converts all text-based language problems to text-to-text format for English. The multilingual variant is mT5 (multilingual T5) which has shown promising results on many NLP tasks across languages. However, the size of this multilingual model is a drawback for its application in real production applications, which sometimes require only one language. In this study, the mT5 model was adapted for only one language, Indonesian, resulting in a pre-trained T5 model that was specific only for Indonesian with a smaller size. For performance comparison, we fine-tuned this model and the mT5 model to the Sentiment Analysis (SA), Question Generation (QG), and Question Answering (QA) tasks with the exact mechanism and dataset. Fine-tuned model based on our model achieved 77.18% accuracy on SA, 8% higher than the mT5-based model, and obtained nearly the same score as the mT5-based model on QG and QA. The results confirm that it is possible to produce a smaller pre-trained model that maintains comparable yields while reducing the model size by up to 58%. In addition, the resulting model requires less memory, loads faster, and inference times faster. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where the model needs to handle distribution shifts from training, is a major challenge of machine learning. Recently, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models have shown impressive zero-shot ability, revealing a promising path toward OOD generalization. However, to boost upon zero-shot performance, further adaptation of CLIP on downstream tasks is indispensable but undesirably degrades OOD generalization ability. In this paper, we aim at generalizing CLIP to out-of-distribution test data on downstream tasks. Beyond the two canonical OOD situations, domain shift and open class, we tackle a more general but difficult in-the-wild setting where both OOD situations may occur on the unseen test data. We propose CLIPood, a simple fine-tuning method that can adapt CLIP models to all OOD situations. To exploit semantic relations between classes from the text modality, CLIPood introduces a new training objective, margin metric softmax (MMS), with class adaptive margins for fine-tuning. Moreover, to incorporate both the pre-trained zero-shot model and the fine-tuned task-adaptive model, CLIPood proposes a new Beta moving average (BMA) to maintain a temporal ensemble according to Beta distribution. Experiments on diverse datasets with different OOD scenarios show that CLIPood consistently outperforms existing generalization techniques. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a technique to train a deep learning model to identify unseen classes using the image attribute. In this paper, we put forth a new GZSL approach exploiting Vision Transformer (ViT) to maximize the attribute-related information contained in the image feature. In ViT, the entire image region is processed without the degradation of the image resolution and the local image information is preserved in patch features. To fully enjoy these benefits of ViT, we exploit patch features as well as the CLS feature in extracting the attribute-related image feature. In particular, we propose a novel attention-based module, called attribute attention module (AAM), to aggregate the attribute-related information in patch features. In AAM, the correlation between each patch feature and the synthetic image attribute is used as the importance weight for each patch. From extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art GZSL approaches by a large margin. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is widely used for brain neurological disease diagnosis; while longitudinal MRIs are often collected to monitor and capture disease progression, as clinically used in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most current methods neglect AD's progressive nature and only take a single sMRI for recognizing AD. In this paper, we consider the problem of leveraging the longitudinal MRIs of a subject for AD identification. To capture longitudinal changes in sMRIs, we propose a novel model Longformer, a spatiotemporal transformer network that performs attention mechanisms spatially on sMRIs at each time point and integrates brain region features over time to obtain longitudinal embeddings for classification. Our Longformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on two binary classification tasks of separating different stages of AD using the ADNI dataset.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent progress in scaling up large language models has shown impressive capabilities in performing few-shot learning across a wide range of text-based tasks. However, a key limitation is that these language models fundamentally lack visual perception - a crucial attribute needed to extend these models to be able to interact with the real world and solve vision tasks, such as in visual-question answering and robotics. Prior works have largely connected image to text through pretraining and/or fine-tuning on curated image-text datasets, which can be a costly and expensive process. In order to resolve this limitation, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Language-Quantized AutoEncoder (LQAE), a modification of VQ-VAE that learns to align text-image data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging pretrained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Our main idea is to encode image as sequences of text tokens by directly quantizing image embeddings using a pretrained language codebook. We then apply random masking followed by a BERT model, and have the decoder reconstruct the original image from BERT predicted text token embeddings. By doing so, LQAE learns to represent similar images with similar clusters of text tokens, thereby aligning these two modalities without the use of aligned text-image pairs. This enables few-shot image classification with large language models (e.g., GPT-3) as well as linear classification of images based on BERT text features. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first work that uses unaligned images for multimodal tasks by leveraging the power of pretrained language models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of synthesizing high-quality facial images. Despite their success, GANs do not provide any information about the relationship between the input vectors and the generated images. Currently, facial GANs are trained on imbalanced datasets, which generate less diverse images. For example, more than 77% of 100K images that we randomly synthesized using the StyleGAN3 are classified as Happy, and only around 3% are Angry. The problem even becomes worse when a mixture of facial attributes is desired: less than 1% of the generated samples are Angry Woman, and only around 2% are Happy Black. To address these problems, this paper proposes a framework, called GANalyzer, for the analysis, and manipulation of the latent space of well-trained GANs. GANalyzer consists of a set of transformation functions designed to manipulate latent vectors for a specific facial attribute such as facial Expression, Age, Gender, and Race. We analyze facial attribute entanglement in the latent space of GANs and apply the proposed transformation for editing the disentangled facial attributes. Our experimental results demonstrate the strength of GANalyzer in editing facial attributes and generating any desired faces. We also create and release a balanced photo-realistic human face dataset.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. However, existing CoT studies are mostly isolated in the language modality with LLMs, where LLMs are hard to deploy. To elicit CoT reasoning in multimodality, a possible solution is to fine-tune small language models by fusing the vision and language features to perform CoT reasoning. The key challenge is that those language models tend to generate hallucinated reasoning chains that mislead the answer inference. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates vision features in a decoupled training framework. The framework separates the rationale generation and answer inference into two stages. By incorporating the vision features in both stages, the model is able to generate effective rationales that contribute to answer inference. With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters outperforms the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16% (75.17%-&gt;91.68%) on the ScienceQA benchmark and even surpasses human performance.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Daily images may convey abstract meanings that require us to memorize and infer profound information from them. To encourage such human-like reasoning, in this work, we teach machines to predict where and when it was taken rather than performing basic tasks like traditional segmentation or classification. Inspired by Horn's QR theory, we designed a novel QR-CLIP model consisting of two components: 1) the Quantity module first retrospects more open-world knowledge as the candidate language inputs; 2) the Relevance module carefully estimates vision and language cues and infers the location and time. Experiments show our QR-CLIP's effectiveness, and it outperforms the previous SOTA on each task by an average of about 10% and 130% relative lift in terms of location and time reasoning. This study lays a technical foundation for location and time reasoning and suggests that effectively introducing open-world knowledge is one of the panaceas for the tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Binary neural networks (BNNs) have received ever-increasing popularity for their great capability of reducing storage burden as well as quickening inference time. However, there is a severe performance drop compared with {real-valued} networks, due to its intrinsic frequent weight oscillation during training. In this paper, we introduce a Resilient Binary Neural Network (ReBNN) to mitigate the frequent oscillation for better BNNs' training. We identify that the weight oscillation mainly stems from the non-parametric scaling factor. To address this issue, we propose to parameterize the scaling factor and introduce a weighted reconstruction loss to build an adaptive training objective. %To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to solve BNNs based on a dynamically re-weighted loss function. For the first time, we show that the weight oscillation is controlled by the balanced parameter attached to the reconstruction loss, which provides a theoretical foundation to parameterize it in back propagation. Based on this, we learn our ReBNN by {calculating} the {balanced} parameter {based on} its maximum magnitude, which can effectively mitigate the weight oscillation with a resilient training process. Extensive experiments are conducted upon various network models, such as ResNet and Faster-RCNN for computer vision, as well as BERT for natural language processing. The results demonstrate the overwhelming performance of our ReBNN over prior arts. For example, our ReBNN achieves 66.9\% Top-1 accuracy with ResNet-18 backbone on the ImageNet dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-arts by a significant margin.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work we explore how language models can be employed to analyze language and discriminate between mentally impaired and healthy subjects through the perplexity metric. Perplexity was originally conceived as an information-theoretic measure to assess how much a given language model is suited to predict a text sequence or, equivalently, how much a word sequence fits into a specific language model. We carried out an extensive experimentation with the publicly available data, and employed language models as diverse as N-grams, from 2-grams to 5-grams, and GPT-2, a transformer-based language model. We investigated whether perplexity scores may be used to discriminate between the transcripts of healthy subjects and subjects suffering from Alzheimer Disease (AD). Our best performing models achieved full accuracy and F-score (1.00 in both precision/specificity and recall/sensitivity) in categorizing subjects from both the AD class and control subjects. These results suggest that perplexity can be a valuable analytical metrics with potential application to supporting early diagnosis of symptoms of mental disorders. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Polyp segmentation within colonoscopy video frames using deep learning models has the potential to automate the workflow of clinicians. This could help improve the early detection rate and characterization of polyps which could progress to colorectal cancer. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning polyp segmentation models have combined the outputs of Fully Convolutional Network architectures and Transformer Network architectures which work in parallel. In this paper we propose modifications to the current state-of-the-art polyp segmentation model FCBFormer. The transformer architecture of the FCBFormer is replaced with a SwinV2 Transformer-UNET and minor changes to the Fully Convolutional Network architecture are made to create the FCB-SwinV2 Transformer. The performance of the FCB-SwinV2 Transformer is evaluated on the popular colonoscopy segmentation bench-marking datasets Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB. Generalizability tests are also conducted. The FCB-SwinV2 Transformer is able to consistently achieve higher mDice scores across all tests conducted and therefore represents new state-of-the-art performance. Issues found with how colonoscopy segmentation model performance is evaluated within literature are also re-ported and discussed. One of the most important issues identified is that when evaluating performance on the CVC-ClinicDB dataset it would be preferable to ensure no data leakage from video sequences occurs during the training/validation/test data partition. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Training complex machine learning (ML) architectures requires a compute and time consuming process of selecting the right optimizer and tuning its hyper-parameters. A new paradigm of learning optimizers from data has emerged as a better alternative to hand-designed ML optimizers. We propose Mnemosyne optimizer, that uses Performers: implicit low-rank attention Transformers. It can learn to train entire neural network architectures including other Transformers without any task-specific optimizer tuning. We show that Mnemosyne: (a) generalizes better than popular LSTM optimizer, (b) in particular can successfully train Vision Transformers (ViTs) while meta--trained on standard MLPs and (c) can initialize optimizers for faster convergence in Robotics applications. We believe that these results open the possibility of using Transformers to build foundational optimization models that can address the challenges of regular Transformer training. We complement our results with an extensive theoretical analysis of the compact associative memory used by Mnemosyne. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The degradation in the underwater images is due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and to the diversity of the water types in which they are captured. Deep neural networks take a step in this field, providing autonomous models able to achieve the enhancement of underwater images. We introduce Underwater Capsules Vectors GAN UWCVGAN based on the discrete features quantization paradigm from VQGAN for this task. The proposed UWCVGAN combines an encoding network, which compresses the image into its latent representation, with a decoding network, able to reconstruct the enhancement of the image from the only latent representation. In contrast with VQGAN, UWCVGAN achieves feature quantization by exploiting the clusterization ability of capsule layer, making the model completely trainable and easier to manage. The model obtains enhanced underwater images with high quality and fine details. Moreover, the trained encoder is independent of the decoder giving the possibility to be embedded onto the collector as compressing algorithm to reduce the memory space required for the images, of factor $3\times$. \myUWCVGAN{ }is validated with quantitative and qualitative analysis on benchmark datasets, and we present metrics results compared with the state of the art. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The rapid ascent in carbon dioxide emissions is a major cause of global warming and climate change, which pose a huge threat to human survival and impose far-reaching influence on the global ecosystem. Therefore, it is very necessary to effectively control carbon dioxide emissions by accurately predicting and analyzing the change trend timely, so as to provide a reference for carbon dioxide emissions mitigation measures. This paper is aiming to select a suitable model to predict the near-real-time daily emissions based on univariate daily time-series data from January 1st, 2020 to September 30st, 2022 of all sectors (Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Residential, Domestic Aviation, International Aviation) in China. We proposed six prediction models, which including three statistical models: Grey prediction (GM(1,1)), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX); three machine learning models: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and long short term memory (LSTM). To evaluate the performance of these models, five criteria: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Coefficient of Determination () are imported and discussed in detail. In the results, three machine learning models perform better than that three statistical models, in which LSTM model performs the best on five criteria values for daily emissions prediction with the 3.5179e-04 MSE value, 0.0187 RMSE value, 0.0140 MAE value, 14.8291% MAPE value and 0.9844 value. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to forecasting state-level COVID-19 trends of weekly cumulative death in the United States (US) and incident cases in Germany. This approach includes a transformer model, an ensemble method, and a data augmentation technique for time series. We arrange the inputs of the transformer in such a way that predictions for different states can attend to the trends of the others. To overcome the issue of scarcity of training data for this COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a novel data augmentation technique to generate useful data for training. More importantly, the generated data can also be used for model validation. As such, it has a two-fold advantage: 1) more actual observations can be used for training, and 2) the model can be validated on data which has distribution closer to the expected situation. Our model has achieved some of the best state-level results on the COVID-19 Forecast Hub for the US and for Germany. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Fast generation of high-quality 3D digital humans is important to a vast number of applications ranging from entertainment to professional concerns. Recent advances in differentiable rendering have enabled the training of 3D generative models without requiring 3D ground truths. However, the quality of the generated 3D humans still has much room to improve in terms of both fidelity and diversity. In this paper, we present Get3DHuman, a novel 3D human framework that can significantly boost the realism and diversity of the generated outcomes by only using a limited budget of 3D ground-truth data. Our key observation is that the 3D generator can profit from human-related priors learned through 2D human generators and 3D reconstructors. Specifically, we bridge the latent space of Get3DHuman with that of StyleGAN-Human via a specially-designed prior network, where the input latent code is mapped to the shape and texture feature volumes spanned by the pixel-aligned 3D reconstructor. The outcomes of the prior network are then leveraged as the supervisory signals for the main generator network. To ensure effective training, we further propose three tailored losses applied to the generated feature volumes and the intermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Get3DHuman greatly outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches and can support a wide range of applications including shape interpolation, shape re-texturing, and single-view reconstruction through latent inversion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The spiking neural network (SNN) using leaky-integrated-and-fire (LIF) neurons has been commonly used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. However, the LIF neuron is still relatively simple compared to that in the biological brain. Further research on more types of neurons with different scales of neuronal dynamics is necessary. Here we introduce four types of neuronal dynamics to post-process the sequential patterns generated from the spiking transformer to get the complex dynamic neuron improved spiking transformer neural network (DyTr-SNN). We found that the DyTr-SNN could handle the non-toy automatic speech recognition task well, representing a lower phoneme error rate, lower computational cost, and higher robustness. These results indicate that the further cooperation of SNNs and neural dynamics at the neuron and network scales might have much in store for the future, especially on the ASR tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present Factor Fields, a novel framework for modeling and representing signals. Factor Fields decomposes a signal into a product of factors, each of which is represented by a neural or regular field representation operating on a coordinate transformed input signal. We show that this decomposition yields a unified framework that generalizes several recent signal representations including NeRF, PlenOxels, EG3D, Instant-NGP, and TensoRF. Moreover, the framework allows for the creation of powerful new signal representations, such as the Coefficient-Basis Factorization (CoBaFa) which we propose in this paper. As evidenced by our experiments, CoBaFa leads to improvements over previous fast reconstruction methods in terms of the three critical goals in neural signal representation: approximation quality, compactness and efficiency. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our representation achieves better image approximation quality on 2D image regression tasks, higher geometric quality when reconstructing 3D signed distance fields and higher compactness for radiance field reconstruction tasks compared to previous fast reconstruction methods. Besides, our CoBaFa representation enables generalization by sharing the basis across signals during training, enabling generalization tasks such as image regression with sparse observations and few-shot radiance field reconstruction. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this article, we present our approach to personalizing Etsy Ads through encoding and learning from short-term (one-hour) sequences of user actions and diverse representations. To this end we introduce a three-component adSformer diversifiable personalization module (ADPM) and illustrate how we use this module to derive a short-term dynamic user representation and personalize the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Post-Click Conversion Rate (PCCVR) models used in sponsored search (ad) ranking. The first component of the ADPM is a custom transformer encoder that learns the inherent structure from the sequence of actions. ADPM's second component enriches the signal through visual, multimodal and textual pretrained representations. Lastly, the third ADPM component includes a "learned" on the fly average pooled representation. The ADPM-personalized CTR and PCCVR models, henceforth referred to as adSformer CTR and adSformer PCCVR, outperform the CTR and PCCVR production baselines by $+6.65\%$ and $+12.70\%$, respectively, in offline Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (PR AUC).

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Understanding the extent to which the perceptual world can be recovered from language is a fundamental problem in cognitive science. We reformulate this problem as that of distilling psychophysical information from text and show how this can be done by combining large language models (LLMs) with a classic psychophysical method based on similarity judgments. Specifically, we use the prompt auto-completion functionality of GPT3, a state-of-the-art LLM, to elicit similarity scores between stimuli and then apply multidimensional scaling to uncover their underlying psychological space. We test our approach on six perceptual domains and show that the elicited judgments strongly correlate with human data and successfully recover well-known psychophysical structures such as the color wheel and pitch spiral. We also explore meaningful divergences between LLM and human representations. Our work showcases how combining state-of-the-art machine models with well-known cognitive paradigms can shed new light on fundamental questions in perception and language research. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis, but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic images and member images). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods precisely infer the membership with high confidence on both of the two scenarios across six different datasets <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present speculative sampling, an algorithm for accelerating transformer decoding by enabling the generation of multiple tokens from each transformer call. Our algorithm relies on the observation that the latency of parallel scoring of short continuations, generated by a faster but less powerful draft model, is comparable to that of sampling a single token from the larger target model. This is combined with a novel modified rejection sampling scheme which preserves the distribution of the target model within hardware numerics. We benchmark speculative sampling with Chinchilla, a 70 billion parameter language model, achieving a 2-2.5x decoding speedup in a distributed setup, without compromising the sample quality or making modifications to the model itself. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Text-driven image and video diffusion models have recently achieved unprecedented generation realism. While diffusion models have been successfully applied for image editing, very few works have done so for video editing. We present the first diffusion-based method that is able to perform text-based motion and appearance editing of general videos. Our approach uses a video diffusion model to combine, at inference time, the low-resolution spatio-temporal information from the original video with new, high resolution information that it synthesized to align with the guiding text prompt. As obtaining high-fidelity to the original video requires retaining some of its high-resolution information, we add a preliminary stage of finetuning the model on the original video, significantly boosting fidelity. We propose to improve motion editability by a new, mixed objective that jointly finetunes with full temporal attention and with temporal attention masking. We further introduce a new framework for image animation. We first transform the image into a coarse video by simple image processing operations such as replication and perspective geometric projections, and then use our general video editor to animate it. As a further application, we can use our method for subject-driven video generation. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments showcase the remarkable editing ability of our method and establish its superior performance compared to baseline methods. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Molecular dynamic simulations are important in computational physics, chemistry, material, and biology. Machine learning-based methods have shown strong abilities in predicting molecular energy and properties and are much faster than DFT calculations. Molecular energy is at least related to atoms, bonds, bond angles, torsion angles, and nonbonding atom pairs. Previous Transformer models only use atoms as inputs which lack explicit modeling of the aforementioned factors. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Moleformer, a novel Transformer architecture that takes nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds and nonbonding atom pairs) as inputs and models the interactions among them using rotational and translational invariant geometry-aware spatial encoding. Proposed spatial encoding calculates relative position information including distances and angles among nodes and edges. We benchmark Moleformer on OC20 and QM9 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art on the initial state to relaxed energy prediction of OC20 and is very competitive in QM9 on predicting quantum chemical properties compared to other Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods which proves the effectiveness of the proposed geometry-aware spatial encoding in Moleformer. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We consider the problem of answering observational, interventional, and counterfactual queries in a causally sufficient setting where only observational data and the causal graph are available. Utilizing the recent developments in diffusion models, we introduce diffusion-based causal models (DCM) to learn causal mechanisms, that generate unique latent encodings to allow for direct sampling under interventions as well as abduction for counterfactuals. We utilize DCM to model structural equations, seeing that diffusion models serve as a natural candidate here since they encode each node to a latent representation, a proxy for the exogenous noise, and offer flexible and accurate modeling to provide reliable causal statements and estimates. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for answering causal queries. Our theoretical results provide a methodology for analyzing the counterfactual error for general encoder/decoder models which could be of independent interest. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We provide a theoretical justification for sample recovery using diffusion based image inpainting in a linear model setting. While most inpainting algorithms require retraining with each new mask, we prove that diffusion based inpainting generalizes well to unseen masks without retraining. We analyze a recently proposed popular diffusion based inpainting algorithm called RePaint (Lugmayr et al., 2022), and show that it has a bias due to misalignment that hampers sample recovery even in a two-state diffusion process. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a modified RePaint algorithm we call RePaint$^+$ that provably recovers the underlying true sample and enjoys a linear rate of convergence. It achieves this by rectifying the misalignment error present in drift and dispersion of the reverse process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linear convergence result for a diffusion based image inpainting algorithm. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
