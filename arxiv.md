### [Towards Better Long-range Time Series Forecasting using Generative  Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06142)
Long-range time series forecasting is usually based on one of two existing forecasting strategies: Direct Forecasting and Iterative Forecasting, where the former provides low bias, high variance forecasts and the latter leads to low variance, high bias forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting strategy called Generative Forecasting (GenF), which generates synthetic data for the next few time steps and then makes long-range forecasts based on generated and observed data. We theoretically prove that GenF is able to better balance the forecasting variance and bias, leading to a much smaller forecasting error. We implement GenF via three components: (i) a novel conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generator for synthetic time series data generation, called CWGAN-TS. (ii) a transformer based predictor, which makes long-range predictions using both generated and observed data. (iii) an information theoretic clustering algorithm to improve the training of both the CWGAN-TS and the transformer based predictor. The experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate that GenF significantly outperforms a diverse range of state-of-the-art benchmarks and classical approaches. Specifically, we find a 5% - 11% improvement in predictive performance (mean absolute error) while having a 15% - 50% reduction in parameters compared to the benchmarks. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study to further explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of the components comprising GenF. 

### [Data Leakage via Access Patterns of Sparse Features in Deep  Learning-based Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06264)
Online personalized recommendation services are generally hosted in the cloud where users query the cloud-based model to receive recommended input such as merchandise of interest or news feed. State-of-the-art recommendation models rely on sparse and dense features to represent users' profile information and the items they interact with. Although sparse features account for 99% of the total model size, there was not enough attention paid to the potential information leakage through sparse features. These sparse features are employed to track users' behavior, e.g., their click history, object interactions, etc., potentially carrying each user's private information. Sparse features are represented as learned embedding vectors that are stored in large tables, and personalized recommendation is performed by using a specific user's sparse feature to index through the tables. Even with recently-proposed methods that hides the computation happening in the cloud, an attacker in the cloud may be able to still track the access patterns to the embedding tables. This paper explores the private information that may be learned by tracking a recommendation model's sparse feature access patterns. We first characterize the types of attacks that can be carried out on sparse features in recommendation models in an untrusted cloud, followed by a demonstration of how each of these attacks leads to extracting users' private information or tracking users by their behavior over time. 

### [Mortality Prediction Models with Clinical Notes Using Sparse Attention  at the Word and Sentence Levels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06267)
Intensive Care in-hospital mortality prediction has various clinical applications. Neural prediction models, especially when capitalising on clinical notes, have been put forward as improvement on currently existing models. However, to be acceptable these models should be performant and transparent. This work studies different attention mechanisms for clinical neural prediction models in terms of their discrimination and calibration. Specifically, we investigate sparse attention as an alternative to dense attention weights in the task of in-hospital mortality prediction from clinical notes. We evaluate the attention mechanisms based on: i) local self-attention over words in a sentence, and ii) global self-attention with a transformer architecture across sentences. We demonstrate that the sparse mechanism approach outperforms the dense one for the local self-attention in terms of predictive performance with a publicly available dataset, and puts higher attention to prespecified relevant directive words. The performance at the sentence level, however, deteriorates as sentences including the influential directive words tend to be dropped all together. 

### [Generative artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic detection of  nicotine-related circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06330)
The identification of addiction-related circuits is critical for explaining addiction processes and developing addiction treatments. And models of functional addiction circuits developed from functional imaging are an effective tool for discovering and verifying addiction circuits. However, analyzing functional imaging data of addiction and detecting functional addiction circuits still have challenges. We have developed a data-driven and end-to-end generative artificial intelligence(AI) framework to address these difficulties. The framework integrates dynamic brain network modeling and novel network architecture networks architecture, including temporal graph Transformer and contrastive learning modules. A complete workflow is formed by our generative AI framework: the functional imaging data, from neurobiological experiments, and computational modeling, to end-to-end neural networks, is transformed into dynamic nicotine addiction-related circuits. It enables the detection of addiction-related brain circuits with dynamic properties and reveals the underlying mechanisms of addiction. 

### [CAT: Learning to Collaborate Channel and Spatial Attention from  Multi-Information Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06335)
Channel and spatial attention mechanism has proven to provide an evident performance boost of deep convolution neural networks (CNNs). Most existing methods focus on one or run them parallel (series), neglecting the collaboration between the two attentions. In order to better establish the feature interaction between the two types of attention, we propose a plug-and-play attention module, which we term "CAT"-activating the Collaboration between spatial and channel Attentions based on learned Traits. Specifically, we represent traits as trainable coefficients (i.e., colla-factors) to adaptively combine contributions of different attention modules to fit different image hierarchies and tasks better. Moreover, we propose the global entropy pooling (GEP) apart from global average pooling (GAP) and global maximum pooling (GMP) operators, an effective component in suppressing noise signals by measuring the information disorder of feature maps. We introduce a three-way pooling operation into attention modules and apply the adaptive mechanism to fuse their outcomes. Extensive experiments on MS COCO, Pascal-VOC, Cifar-100, and ImageNet show that our CAT outperforms existing state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in object detection, instance segmentation, and image classification. The model and code will be released soon. 

### [Score-based Generative Modeling Secretly Minimizes the Wasserstein  Distance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06359)
Score-based generative models are shown to achieve remarkable empirical performances in various applications such as image generation and audio synthesis. However, a theoretical understanding of score-based diffusion models is still incomplete. Recently, Song et al. showed that the training objective of score-based generative models is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the generated distribution from the data distribution. In this work, we show that score-based models also minimize the Wasserstein distance between them under suitable assumptions on the model. Specifically, we prove that the Wasserstein distance is upper bounded by the square root of the objective function up to multiplicative constants and a fixed constant offset. Our proof is based on a novel application of the theory of optimal transport, which can be of independent interest to the society. Our numerical experiments support our findings. By analyzing our upper bounds, we provide a few techniques to obtain tighter upper bounds. 

### [InferEM: Inferring the Speaker's Intention for Empathetic Dialogue  Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06373)
Current approaches to empathetic response generation typically encode the entire dialogue history directly and put the output into a decoder to generate friendly feedback. These methods focus on modelling contextual information but neglect capturing the direct intention of the speaker. We argue that the last utterance in the dialogue empirically conveys the intention of the speaker. Consequently, we propose a novel model named InferEM for empathetic response generation. We separately encode the last utterance and fuse it with the entire dialogue through multi-head attention based intention fusion module to capture the speaker's intention. Besides, we utilize previous utterances to predict the last utterance, which simulates human's psychology to guess what the interlocutor may speak in advance. To balance the optimizing rates of the utterance prediction and response generation, a multi-task learning strategy is designed for InferEM. Experimental results demonstrate the plausibility and validity of InferEM in improving empathetic expression. 

### [PV3D: A 3D Generative Model for Portrait Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06384)
Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated the capabilities of generating stunning photo-realistic portrait images. While some prior works have applied such image GANs to unconditional 2D portrait video generation and static 3D portrait synthesis, there are few works successfully extending GANs for generating 3D-aware portrait videos. In this work, we propose PV3D, the first generative framework that can synthesize multi-view consistent portrait videos. Specifically, our method extends the recent static 3D-aware image GAN to the video domain by generalizing the 3D implicit neural representation to model the spatio-temporal space. To introduce motion dynamics to the generation process, we develop a motion generator by stacking multiple motion layers to generate motion features via modulated convolution. To alleviate motion ambiguities caused by camera/human motions, we propose a simple yet effective camera condition strategy for PV3D, enabling both temporal and multi-view consistent video generation. Moreover, PV3D introduces two discriminators for regularizing the spatial and temporal domains to ensure the plausibility of the generated portrait videos. These elaborated designs enable PV3D to generate 3D-aware motion-plausible portrait videos with high-quality appearance and geometry, significantly outperforming prior works. As a result, PV3D is able to support many downstream applications such as animating static portraits and view-consistent video motion editing. Code and models will be released at https://showlab.github.io/pv3d. 

### [Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06419)
Traffic forecasting has attracted widespread attention recently. In reality, traffic data usually contains missing values due to sensor or communication errors. The Spatio-temporal feature in traffic data brings more challenges for processing such missing values, for which the classic techniques (e.g., data imputations) are limited: 1) in temporal axis, the values can be randomly or consecutively missing; 2) in spatial axis, the missing values can happen on one single sensor or on multiple sensors simultaneously. Recent models powered by Graph Neural Networks achieved satisfying performance on traffic forecasting tasks. However, few of them are applicable to such a complex missing-value context. To this end, we propose GCN-M, a Graph Convolutional Network model with the ability to handle the complex missing values in the Spatio-temporal context. Particularly, we jointly model the missing value processing and traffic forecasting tasks, considering both local Spatio-temporal features and global historical patterns in an attention-based memory network. We propose as well a dynamic graph learning module based on the learned local-global features. The experimental results on real-life datasets show the reliability of our proposed method. 

### [Object-fabrication Targeted Attack for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06431)
Recent researches show that the deep learning based object detection is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Generally, the adversarial attack for object detection contains targeted attack and untargeted attack. According to our detailed investigations, the research on the former is relatively fewer than the latter and all the existing methods for the targeted attack follow the same mode, i.e., the object-mislabeling mode that misleads detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, this mode has limited attack success rate, universal and generalization performances. In this paper, we propose a new object-fabrication targeted attack mode which can mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra false objects with specific target labels. Furthermore, we design a dual attention based targeted feature space attack method to implement the proposed targeted attack mode. The attack performances of the proposed mode and method are evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets using FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results demonstrate that, the proposed object-fabrication targeted attack mode and the corresponding targeted feature space attack method show significant improvements in terms of image-specific attack, universal performance and generalization capability, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection. Code will be made available. 

### [HS-Diffusion: Learning a Semantic-Guided Diffusion Model for Head  Swapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06458)
Image-based head swapping task aims to stitch a source head to another source body flawlessly. This seldom-studied task faces two major challenges: 1) Preserving the head and body from various sources while generating a seamless transition region. 2) No paired head swapping dataset and benchmark so far. In this paper, we propose an image-based head swapping framework (HS-Diffusion) which consists of a semantic-guided latent diffusion model (SG-LDM) and a semantic layout generator. We blend the semantic layouts of source head and source body, and then inpaint the transition region by the semantic layout generator, achieving a coarse-grained head swapping. SG-LDM can further implement fine-grained head swapping with the blended layout as condition by a progressive fusion process, while preserving source head and source body with high-quality reconstruction. To this end, we design a head-cover augmentation strategy for training and a neck alignment trick for geometric realism. Importantly, we construct a new image-based head swapping benchmark and propose two tailor-designed metrics (Mask-FID and Focal-FID). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework. The code will be available: https://github.com/qinghew/HS-Diffusion. 

### [DifFace: Blind Face Restoration with Diffused Error Contraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06512)
While deep learning-based methods for blind face restoration have achieved unprecedented success, they still suffer from two major limitations. First, most of them deteriorate when facing complex degradations out of their training data. Second, these methods require multiple constraints, e.g., fidelity, perceptual, and adversarial losses, which require laborious hyper-parameter tuning to stabilize and balance their influences. In this work, we propose a novel method named DifFace that is capable of coping with unseen and complex degradations more gracefully without complicated loss designs. The key of our method is to establish a posterior distribution from the observed low-quality (LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) counterpart. In particular, we design a transition distribution from the LQ image to the intermediate state of a pre-trained diffusion model and then gradually transmit from this intermediate state to the HQ target by recursively applying a pre-trained diffusion model. The transition distribution only relies on a restoration backbone that is trained with $L_2$ loss on some synthetic data, which favorably avoids the cumbersome training process in existing methods. Moreover, the transition distribution can contract the error of the restoration backbone and thus makes our method more robust to unknown degradations. Comprehensive experiments show that DifFace is superior to current state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases with severe degradations. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/zsyOAOA/DifFace. 

### [SST: Real-time End-to-end Monocular 3D Reconstruction via Sparse  Spatial-Temporal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06524)
Real-time monocular 3D reconstruction is a challenging problem that remains unsolved. Although recent end-to-end methods have demonstrated promising results, tiny structures and geometric boundaries are hardly captured due to their insufficient supervision neglecting spatial details and oversimplified feature fusion ignoring temporal cues. To address the problems, we propose an end-to-end 3D reconstruction network SST, which utilizes Sparse estimated points from visual SLAM system as additional Spatial guidance and fuses Temporal features via a novel cross-modal attention mechanism, achieving more detailed reconstruction results. We propose a Local Spatial-Temporal Fusion module to exploit more informative spatial-temporal cues from multi-view color information and sparse priors, as well a Global Spatial-Temporal Fusion module to refine the local TSDF volumes with the world-frame model from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes demonstrate that SST outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors, whilst keeping a high inference speed at 59 FPS, enabling real-world applications with real-time requirements. 

### [Localized Latent Updates for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06556)
Although massive pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP show impressive generalization capabilities for many tasks, still it often remains necessary to fine-tune them for improved performance on specific datasets. When doing so, it is desirable that updating the model is fast and that the model does not lose its capabilities on data outside of the dataset, as is often the case with classical fine-tuning approaches. In this work we suggest a lightweight adapter, that only updates the models predictions close to seen datapoints. We demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of this relatively simple approach in the context of few-shot learning, where our results both on classes seen and unseen during training are comparable with or improve on the state of the art. 

### [CamoFormer: Masked Separable Attention for Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06570)
How to identify and segment camouflaged objects from the background is challenging. Inspired by the multi-head self-attention in Transformers, we present a simple masked separable attention (MSA) for camouflaged object detection. We first separate the multi-head self-attention into three parts, which are responsible for distinguishing the camouflaged objects from the background using different mask strategies. Furthermore, we propose to capture high-resolution semantic representations progressively based on a simple top-down decoder with the proposed MSA to attain precise segmentation results. These structures plus a backbone encoder form a new model, dubbed CamoFormer. Extensive experiments show that CamoFormer surpasses all existing state-of-the-art methods on three widely-used camouflaged object detection benchmarks. There are on average around 5% relative improvements over previous methods in terms of S-measure and weighted F-measure. 

### [On Text-based Personality Computing: Challenges and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06711)
Text-based personality computing (TPC) has gained many research interests in NLP. In this paper, we describe 15 challenges that we consider deserving the attention of the research community. These challenges are organized by the following topics: personality taxonomies, measurement quality, datasets, performance evaluation, modelling choices, as well as ethics and fairness. When addressing each challenge, not only do we combine perspectives from both NLP and social sciences, but also offer concrete suggestions towards more valid and reliable TPC research. 

### [Structured Prompting: Scaling In-Context Learning to 1,000 Examples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06713)
Large language models have exhibited intriguing in-context learning capability, achieving promising zero- and few-shot performance without updating the parameters. However, conventional in-context learning is usually restricted by length constraints, rendering it ineffective to absorb supervision from a large number of examples. In order to go beyond few shots, we introduce structured prompting that breaks the length limit and scales in-context learning to thousands of examples. Specifically, demonstration examples are separately encoded with well-designed position embeddings, and then they are jointly attended by the test example using a rescaled attention mechanism. So we can scale the number of exemplars with linear complexity instead of quadratic complexity with respect to length. Experimental results on a diverse set of tasks show that our approach improves end-task performance and reduces evaluation variance over conventional in-context learning as the number of demonstration examples increases. Code has been released at https://aka.ms/structured-prompting. 

### [CNN-transformer mixed model for object detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06714)
Object detection, one of the three main tasks of computer vision, has been used in various applications. The main process is to use deep neural networks to extract the features of an image and then use the features to identify the class and location of an object. Therefore, the main direction to improve the accuracy of object detection tasks is to improve the neural network to extract features better. In this paper, I propose a convolutional module with a transformer[1], which aims to improve the recognition accuracy of the model by fusing the detailed features extracted by CNN[2] with the global features extracted by a transformer and significantly reduce the computational effort of the transformer module by deflating the feature mAP. The main execution steps are convolutional downsampling to reduce the feature map size, then self-attention calculation and upsampling, and finally concatenation with the initial input. In the experimental part, after splicing the block to the end of YOLOv5n[3] and training 300 epochs on the coco dataset, the mAP improved by 1.7% compared with the previous YOLOv5n, and the mAP curve did not show any saturation phenomenon, so there is still potential for improvement. After 100 rounds of training on the Pascal VOC dataset, the accuracy of the results reached 81%, which is 4.6 better than the faster RCNN[4] using resnet101[5] as the backbone, but the number of parameters is less than one-twentieth of it. 

### [Semantic Brain Decoding: from fMRI to conceptually similar image  reconstruction of visual stimuli](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06726)
Brain decoding is a field of computational neuroscience that uses measurable brain activity to infer mental states or internal representations of perceptual inputs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to brain decoding that also relies on semantic and contextual similarity. We employ an fMRI dataset of natural image vision and create a deep learning decoding pipeline inspired by the existence of both bottom-up and top-down processes in human vision. We train a linear brain-to-feature model to map fMRI activity features to visual stimuli features, assuming that the brain projects visual information onto a space that is homeomorphic to the latent space represented by the last convolutional layer of a pretrained convolutional neural network, which typically collects a variety of semantic features that summarize and highlight similarities and differences between concepts. These features are then categorized in the latent space using a nearest-neighbor strategy, and the results are used to condition a generative latent diffusion model to create novel images. From fMRI data only, we produce reconstructions of visual stimuli that match the original content very well on a semantic level, surpassing the state of the art in previous literature. We evaluate our work and obtain good results using a quantitative semantic metric (the Wu-Palmer similarity metric over the WordNet lexicon, which had an average value of 0.57) and perform a human evaluation experiment that resulted in correct evaluation, according to the multiplicity of human criteria in evaluating image similarity, in over 80% of the test set. 

### [Pacific Lamprey Inspired Climbing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06746)
Snakes and their bio-inspired robot counterparts have demonstrated locomotion on a wide range of terrains. However, dynamic vertical climbing is one locomotion strategy that has received little attention in the existing snake robotics literature. We demonstrate a new scansorial gait and robot inspired by the locomotion of the Pacific Lamprey. This new gait allows a robot to steer while climbing on flat, near-vertical surfaces. A reduced-order model is developed and used to explore the relationship between body actuation and vertical and lateral motions of the robot. Trident, the new wall climbing lamprey-inspired robot, demonstrates dynamic climbing on flat vertical surfaces with a peak net vertical stride displacement of 4.1 cm per step. Actuating at 1.3 Hz, Trident attains a vertical climbing speed of 4.8 cm/s (0.09 Bl/s) at specific resistance of 8.3. Trident can also traverse laterally at 9 cm/s (0.17 Bl/s). Moreover, Trident is able to make 14\% longer strides than the Pacific Lamprey when climbing vertically. The computational and experimental results demonstrate that a lamprey-inspired climbing gait coupled with appropriate attachment is a useful climbing strategy for snake robots climbing near vertical surfaces with limited push points. 

### [GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group  Propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06795)
We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require high-resolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ChenhongyiYang/GPViT . 

### [RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06817)
By transferring knowledge from large, diverse, task-agnostic datasets, modern machine learning models can solve specific downstream tasks either zero-shot or with small task-specific datasets to a high level of performance. While this capability has been demonstrated in other fields such as computer vision, natural language processing or speech recognition, it remains to be shown in robotics, where the generalization capabilities of the models are particularly critical due to the difficulty of collecting real-world robotic data. We argue that one of the keys to the success of such general robotic models lies with open-ended task-agnostic training, combined with high-capacity architectures that can absorb all of the diverse, robotic data. In this paper, we present a model class, dubbed Robotics Transformer, that exhibits promising scalable model properties. We verify our conclusions in a study of different model classes and their ability to generalize as a function of the data size, model size, and data diversity based on a large-scale data collection on real robots performing real-world tasks.

### [Structured 3D Features for Reconstructing Relightable and Animatable  Avatars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06820)
We introduce Structured 3D Features, a model based on a novel implicit 3D representation that pools pixel-aligned image features onto dense 3D points sampled from a parametric, statistical human mesh surface. The 3D points have associated semantics and can move freely in 3D space. This allows for optimal coverage of the person of interest, beyond just the body shape, which in turn, additionally helps modeling accessories, hair, and loose clothing. Owing to this, we present a complete 3D transformer-based attention framework which, given a single image of a person in an unconstrained pose, generates an animatable 3D reconstruction with albedo and illumination decomposition, as a result of a single end-to-end model, trained semi-supervised, and with no additional postprocessing. We show that our S3F model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on various tasks, including monocular 3D reconstruction, as well as albedo and shading estimation. Moreover, we show that the proposed methodology allows novel view synthesis, relighting, and re-posing the reconstruction, and can naturally be extended to handle multiple input images (e.g. different views of a person, or the same view, in different poses, in video). Finally, we demonstrate the editing capabilities of our model for 3D virtual try-on applications.
