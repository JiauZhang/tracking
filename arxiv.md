### [Human-in-the-loop Abstractive Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09750)
Abstractive dialogue summarization has received increasing attention recently. Despite the fact that most of the current dialogue summarization systems are trained to maximize the likelihood of human-written summaries and have achieved significant results, there is still a huge gap in generating high-quality summaries as determined by humans, such as coherence and faithfulness, partly due to the misalignment in maximizing a single human-written summary. To this end, we propose to incorporate different levels of human feedback into the training process. This will enable us to guide the models to capture the behaviors humans care about for summaries. Specifically, we ask humans to highlight the salient information to be included in summaries to provide the local feedback , and to make overall comparisons among summaries in terms of coherence, accuracy, coverage, concise and overall quality, as the global feedback. We then combine both local and global feedback to fine-tune the dialog summarization policy with Reinforcement Learning. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our methods over the state-of-the-art supervised baselines, especially in terms of human judgments. 

### [Exploring Hybrid and Ensemble Models for Multiclass Prediction of Mental  Health Status on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09839)
In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in research on automatic mental health detection (MHD) from social media data leveraging advances in natural language processing and machine learning techniques. While significant progress has been achieved in this interdisciplinary research area, the vast majority of work has treated MHD as a binary classification task. The multiclass classification setup is, however, essential if we are to uncover the subtle differences among the statistical patterns of language use associated with particular mental health conditions. Here, we report on experiments aimed at predicting six conditions (anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and psychological stress) from Reddit social media posts. We explore and compare the performance of hybrid and ensemble models leveraging transformer-based architectures (BERT and RoBERTa) and BiLSTM neural networks trained on within-text distributions of a diverse set of linguistic features. This set encompasses measures of syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication and diversity, readability, and register-specific ngram frequencies, as well as sentiment and emotion lexicons. In addition, we conduct feature ablation experiments to investigate which types of features are most indicative of particular mental health conditions. 

### [(Psycho-)Linguistic Features Meet Transformer Models for Improved  Explainable and Controllable Text Simplification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09848)
State-of-the-art text simplification (TS) systems adopt end-to-end neural network models to directly generate the simplified version of the input text, and usually function as a blackbox. Moreover, TS is usually treated as an all-purpose generic task under the assumption of homogeneity, where the same simplification is suitable for all. In recent years, however, there has been increasing recognition of the need to adapt the simplification techniques to the specific needs of different target groups. In this work, we aim to advance current research on explainable and controllable TS in two ways: First, building on recently proposed work to increase the transparency of TS systems, we use a large set of (psycho-)linguistic features in combination with pre-trained language models to improve explainable complexity prediction. Second, based on the results of this preliminary task, we extend a state-of-the-art Seq2Seq TS model, ACCESS, to enable explicit control of ten attributes. The results of experiments show (1) that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art models for predicting explainable complexity and (2) that explicitly conditioning the Seq2Seq model on ten attributes leads to a significant improvement in performance in both within-domain and out-of-domain settings. 

### [MANTIS at TSAR-2022 Shared Task: Improved Unsupervised Lexical  Simplification with Pretrained Encoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09855)
In this paper we present our contribution to the TSAR-2022 Shared Task on Lexical Simplification of the EMNLP 2022 Workshop on Text Simplification, Accessibility, and Readability. Our approach builds on and extends the unsupervised lexical simplification system with pretrained encoders (LSBert) system in the following ways: For the subtask of simplification candidate selection, it utilizes a RoBERTa transformer language model and expands the size of the generated candidate list. For subsequent substitution ranking, it introduces a new feature weighting scheme and adopts a candidate filtering method based on textual entailment to maximize semantic similarity between the target word and its simplification. Our best-performing system improves LSBert by 5.9% accuracy and achieves second place out of 33 ranked solutions. 

### [LayoutDETR: Detection Transformer Is a Good Multimodal Layout Designer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09877)
Graphic layout designs play an essential role in visual communication. Yet handcrafting layout designs are skill-demanding, time-consuming, and non-scalable to batch production. Although generative models emerge to make design automation no longer utopian, it remains non-trivial to customize designs that comply with designers' multimodal desires, i.e., constrained by background images and driven by foreground contents. In this study, we propose \textit{LayoutDETR} that inherits the high quality and realism from generative modeling, in the meanwhile reformulating content-aware requirements as a detection problem: we learn to detect in a background image the reasonable locations, scales, and spatial relations for multimodal elements in a layout. Experiments validate that our solution yields new state-of-the-art performance for layout generation on public benchmarks and on our newly-curated ads banner dataset. For practical usage, we build our solution into a graphical system that facilitates user studies. We demonstrate that our designs attract more subjective preference than baselines by significant margins. Our code, models, dataset, graphical system, and demos are available at https://github.com/salesforce/LayoutDETR. 

### [Tokenization Consistency Matters for Generative Models on Extractive NLP  Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09912)
Generative models have been widely applied to solve extractive tasks, where parts of the input is extracted to form the desired output, and achieved significant success. For example, in extractive question answering (QA), generative models have constantly yielded state-of-the-art results. In this work, we identify the issue of tokenization inconsistency that is commonly neglected in training these models. This issue damages the extractive nature of these tasks after the input and output are tokenized inconsistently by the tokenizer, and thus leads to performance drop as well as hallucination. We propose a simple yet effective fix to this issue and conduct a case study on extractive QA. We show that, with consistent tokenization, the model performs better in both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, with a notable average of +1.7 F2 gain when a BART model is trained on SQuAD and evaluated on 8 QA datasets. Further, the model converges faster, and becomes less likely to generate out-of-context answers. With these findings, we would like to call for more attention on how tokenization should be done when solving extractive tasks and recommend applying consistent tokenization during training. 

### [Robust and Resource-efficient Machine Learning Aided Viewport Prediction  in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09945)
360-degree panoramic videos have gained considerable attention in recent years due to the rapid development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and panoramic cameras. One major problem in streaming panoramic videos is that panoramic videos are much larger in size compared to traditional ones. Moreover, the user devices are often in a wireless environment, with limited battery, computation power, and bandwidth. To reduce resource consumption, researchers have proposed ways to predict the users' viewports so that only part of the entire video needs to be transmitted from the server. However, the robustness of such prediction approaches has been overlooked in the literature: it is usually assumed that only a few models, pre-trained on past users' experiences, are applied for prediction to all users. We observe that those pre-trained models can perform poorly for some users because they might have drastically different behaviors from the majority, and the pre-trained models cannot capture the features in unseen videos. In this work, we propose a novel meta learning based viewport prediction paradigm to alleviate the worst prediction performance and ensure the robustness of viewport prediction. This paradigm uses two machine learning models, where the first model predicts the viewing direction, and the second model predicts the minimum video prefetch size that can include the actual viewport. We first train two meta models so that they are sensitive to new training data, and then quickly adapt them to users while they are watching the videos. Evaluation results reveal that the meta models can adapt quickly to each user, and can significantly increase the prediction accuracy, especially for the worst-performing predictions. 

### [Future Sight: Dynamic Story Generation with Large Pretrained Language  Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09947)
Recent advances in deep learning research, such as transformers, have bolstered the ability for automated agents to generate creative texts similar to those that a human would write. By default, transformer decoders can only generate new text with respect to previously generated text. The output distribution of candidate tokens at any position is conditioned on previously selected tokens using a self-attention mechanism to emulate the property of autoregression. This is inherently limiting for tasks such as controllable story generation where it may be necessary to condition on future plot events when writing a story. In this work, we propose Future Sight, a method for finetuning a pretrained generative transformer on the task of future conditioning. Transformer decoders are typically pretrained on the task of completing a context, one token at a time, by means of self-attention. Future Sight additionally enables a decoder to attend to an encoded future plot event. This motivates the decoder to expand on the context in a way that logically concludes with the provided future. During inference, the future plot event can be written by a human author to steer the narrative being generated in a certain direction. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on a story generation task with human evaluators. 

### [Data Augmentation on Graphs: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09970)
In recent years, graph representation learning has achieved remarkable success while suffering from low-quality data problems. As a mature technology to improve data quality in computer vision, data augmentation has also attracted increasing attention in graph domain. For promoting the development of this emerging research direction, in this survey, we comprehensively review and summarize the existing graph data augmentation (GDAug) techniques. Specifically, we first summarize a variety of feasible taxonomies, and then classify existing GDAug studies based on fine-grained graph elements. Furthermore, for each type of GDAug technique, we formalize the general definition, discuss the technical details, and give schematic illustration. In addition, we also summarize common performance metrics and specific design metrics for constructing a GDAug evaluation system. Finally, we summarize the applications of GDAug from both data and model levels, as well as future directions. 

### [Texture Representation via Analysis and Synthesis with Generative  Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09983)
We investigate data-driven texture modeling via analysis and synthesis with generative adversarial networks. For network training and testing, we have compiled a diverse set of spatially homogeneous textures, ranging from stochastic to regular. We adopt StyleGAN3 for synthesis and demonstrate that it produces diverse textures beyond those represented in the training data. For texture analysis, we propose GAN inversion using a novel latent domain reconstruction consistency criterion for synthesized textures, and iterative refinement with Gramian loss for real textures. We propose perceptual procedures for evaluating network capabilities, exploring the global and local behavior of latent space trajectories, and comparing with existing texture analysis-synthesis techniques. 

### [Dynamic Molecular Graph-based Implementation for Biophysical Properties  Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09991)
Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the molecular discovery to understand patterns and identify unknown features that can aid in predicting biophysical properties and protein-ligand interactions. However, current models typically rely on 2-dimensional molecular representations as input, and while utilization of 2\3- dimensional structural data has gained deserved traction in recent years as many of these models are still limited to static graph representations. We propose a novel approach based on the transformer model utilizing GNNs for characterizing dynamic features of protein-ligand interactions. Our message passing transformer pre-trains on a set of molecular dynamic data based off of physics-based simulations to learn coordinate construction and make binding probability and affinity predictions as a downstream task. Through extensive testing we compare our results with the existing models, our MDA-PLI model was able to outperform the molecular interaction prediction models with an RMSE of 1.2958. The geometric encodings enabled by our transformer architecture and the addition of time series data add a new dimensionality to this form of research. 

### [DIONYSUS: A Pre-trained Model for Low-Resource Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10018)
Dialogue summarization has recently garnered significant attention due to its wide range of applications. However, existing methods for summarizing dialogues are suboptimal because they do not take into account the inherent structure of dialogue and rely heavily on labeled data, which can lead to poor performance in new domains. In this work, we propose DIONYSUS (dynamic input optimization in pre-training for dialogue summarization), a pre-trained encoder-decoder model for summarizing dialogues in any new domain. To pre-train DIONYSUS, we create two pseudo summaries for each dialogue example: one is produced by a fine-tuned summarization model, and the other is a collection of dialogue turns that convey important information. We then choose one of these pseudo summaries based on the difference in information distribution across different types of dialogues. This selected pseudo summary serves as the objective for pre-training DIONYSUS using a self-supervised approach on a large dialogue corpus. Our experiments show that DIONYSUS outperforms existing methods on six datasets, as demonstrated by its ROUGE scores in zero-shot and few-shot settings. 

### [Efficient Liquidity Providing via Margin Liquidity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10035)
The limit order book mechanism has been the core trading mechanism of the modern financial market. In the cryptocurrency market, centralized exchanges also adopt this limit order book mechanism and a centralized matching engine dynamically connects the traders to the orders of market makers. Recently, decentralized exchanges have been introduced and received considerable attention in the cryptocurrency community. A decentralized exchange typically adopts an automated market maker, which algorithmically arbitrates the trades between liquidity providers and traders through a pool of crypto assets. Meanwhile, the liquidity of the exchange is the most important factor when traders choose an exchange. However, the amount of liquidity provided by the liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges is insufficient when compared to centralized exchanges. This is because the liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges suffer from the risk of divergence loss inherent to the automated market making system. To this end, we introduce a new concept called margin liquidity and leverage this concept to propose a highly profitable margin liquidity-providing position. Then, we extend this margin liquidity-providing position to a virtual margin liquidity-providing position to alleviate the risk of divergence loss for the liquidity providers and encourage them to provide more liquidity to the pool. Furthermore, we introduce a representative strategy for the margin liquidity-providing position and backtest the strategy with historical data from the BTC/ETH market. Our strategy outperforms a simple holding baseline. We also show that our proposed margin liquidity is 8K times more capital efficient than the concentrated liquidity proposed in Uniswap V3. 

### [A Twitter BERT Approach for Offensive Language Detection in Marathi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10039)
Automated offensive language detection is essential in combating the spread of hate speech, particularly in social media. This paper describes our work on Offensive Language Identification in low resource Indic language Marathi. The problem is formulated as a text classification task to identify a tweet as offensive or non-offensive. We evaluate different mono-lingual and multi-lingual BERT models on this classification task, focusing on BERT models pre-trained with social media datasets. We compare the performance of MuRIL, MahaTweetBERT, MahaTweetBERT-Hateful, and MahaBERT on the HASOC 2022 test set. We also explore external data augmentation from other existing Marathi hate speech corpus HASOC 2021 and L3Cube-MahaHate. The MahaTweetBERT, a BERT model, pre-trained on Marathi tweets when fine-tuned on the combined dataset (HASOC 2021 + HASOC 2022 + MahaHate), outperforms all models with an F1 score of 98.43 on the HASOC 2022 test set. With this, we also provide a new state-of-the-art result on HASOC 2022 / MOLD v2 test set. 

### [OBMO: One Bounding Box Multiple Objects for Monocular 3D Object  Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10049)
Compared to typical multi-sensor systems, monocular 3D object detection has attracted much attention due to its simple configuration. However, there is still a significant gap between LiDAR-based and monocular-based methods. In this paper, we find that the ill-posed nature of monocular imagery can lead to depth ambiguity. Specifically, objects with different depths can appear with the same bounding boxes and similar visual features in the 2D image. Unfortunately, the network cannot accurately distinguish different depths from such non-discriminative visual features, resulting in unstable depth training. To facilitate depth learning, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play module, One Bounding Box Multiple Objects (OBMO). Concretely, we add a set of suitable pseudo labels by shifting the 3D bounding box along the viewing frustum. To constrain the pseudo-3D labels to be reasonable, we carefully design two label scoring strategies to represent their quality. In contrast to the original hard depth labels, such soft pseudo labels with quality scores allow the network to learn a reasonable depth range, boosting training stability and thus improving final performance. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art monocular 3D detectors by a significant margin (The improvements under the moderate setting on KITTI validation set are $\mathbf{1.82\sim 10.91\%}$ mAP in BEV and $\mathbf{1.18\sim 9.36\%}$ mAP in 3D}. Codes have been released at https://github.com/mrsempress/OBMO. 

### [Hybrid Rule-Neural Coreference Resolution System based on Actor-Critic  Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10087)
A coreference resolution system is to cluster all mentions that refer to the same entity in a given context. All coreference resolution systems need to tackle two main tasks: one task is to detect all of the potential mentions, and the other is to learn the linking of an antecedent for each possible mention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid rule-neural coreference resolution system based on actor-critic learning, such that it can achieve better coreference performance by leveraging the advantages from both the heuristic rules and a neural conference model. This end-to-end system can also perform both mention detection and resolution by leveraging a joint training algorithm. We experiment on the BERT model to generate input span representations. Our model with the BERT span representation achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the models on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English Test Set. 

### [Visual Transformers for Primates Classification and Covid Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10093)
We apply the vision transformer, a deep machine learning model build around the attention mechanism, on mel-spectrogram representations of raw audio recordings. When adding mel-based data augmentation techniques and sample-weighting, we achieve comparable performance on both (PRS and CCS challenge) tasks of ComParE21, outperforming most single model baselines. We further introduce overlapping vertical patching and evaluate the influence of parameter configurations. Index Terms: audio classification, attention, mel-spectrogram, unbalanced data-sets, computational paralinguistics 

### [On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10105)
This contribution demonstrates the feasibility of applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on images of EPAL pallet blocks for dataset enhancement in the context of re-identification. For many industrial applications of re-identification methods, datasets of sufficient volume would otherwise be unattainable in non-laboratory settings. Using a state-of-the-art GAN architecture, namely CycleGAN, images of pallet blocks rotated to their left-hand side were generated from images of visually centered pallet blocks, based on images of rotated pallet blocks that were recorded as part of a previously recorded and published dataset. In this process, the unique chipwood pattern of the pallet block surface structure was retained, only changing the orientation of the pallet block itself. By doing so, synthetic data for re-identification testing and training purposes was generated, in a manner that is distinct from ordinary data augmentation. In total, 1,004 new images of pallet blocks were generated. The quality of the generated images was gauged using a perspective classifier that was trained on the original images and then applied to the synthetic ones, comparing the accuracy between the two sets of images. The classification accuracy was 98% for the original images and 92% for the synthetic images. In addition, the generated images were also used in a re-identification task, in order to re-identify original images based on synthetic ones. The accuracy in this scenario was up to 88% for synthetic images, compared to 96% for original images. Through this evaluation, it is established, whether or not a generated pallet block image closely resembles its original counterpart. 

### [True Detective: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Abductive Reasoning  \\in Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10114)
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot reasoning tasks, including abductive reasoning. This is reflected in their ability to perform well on current benchmarks in this area. However, to truly test the limits of LLMs in abductive reasoning, a more challenging benchmark is needed. In this paper, we present such a benchmark, consisting of 191 long-form mystery stories, each approximately 1200 words in length and presented in the form of detective puzzles. Each puzzle includes a multiple-choice question for evaluation sourced from the "5 Minute Mystery" platform. Our results show that state-of-the-art GPT models perform significantly worse than human solvers on this benchmark, with an accuracy of 28\% compared to 47\% for humans. This indicates that there is still a significant gap in the abductive reasoning abilities of LLMs and highlights the need for further research in this area. Our work provides a challenging benchmark for future studies on reasoning in language models and contributes to a better understanding of the limits of LLMs' abilities. 

### [Pay Attention to Your Tone: Introducing a New Dataset for Polite  Language Rewrite](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10190)
We introduce \textsc{PoliteRewrite} -- a dataset for polite language rewrite which is a novel sentence rewrite task. Compared with previous text style transfer tasks that can be mostly addressed by slight token- or phrase-level edits, polite language rewrite requires deep understanding and extensive sentence-level edits over an offensive and impolite sentence to deliver the same message euphemistically and politely, which is more challenging -- not only for NLP models but also for human annotators to rewrite with effort. To alleviate the human effort for efficient annotation, we first propose a novel annotation paradigm by a collaboration of human annotators and GPT-3.5 to annotate \textsc{PoliteRewrite}. The released dataset has 10K polite sentence rewrites annotated collaboratively by GPT-3.5 and human, which can be used as gold standard for training, validation and test; and 100K high-quality polite sentence rewrites by GPT-3.5 without human review. We wish this work (The dataset (10K+100K) will be released soon) could contribute to the research on more challenging sentence rewrite, and provoke more thought in future on resource annotation paradigm with the help of the large-scaled pretrained models. 

### [EIT: Enhanced Interactive Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10197)
In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, the Enhanced Interactive Transformer (EIT), to address the issue of head degradation in self-attention mechanisms. Our approach replaces the traditional multi-head self-attention mechanism with the Enhanced Multi-Head Attention (EMHA) mechanism, which relaxes the one-to-one mapping constraint among queries and keys, allowing each query to attend to multiple keys. Furthermore, we introduce two interaction models, Inner-Subspace Interaction and Cross-Subspace Interaction, to fully utilize the many-to-many mapping capabilities of EMHA. Extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks (e.g. machine translation, abstractive summarization, grammar correction, language modelling and brain disease automatic diagnosis) show its superiority with a very modest increase in model size. 

### [Graph Neural Networks in Computer Vision -- Architectures, Datasets and  Common Approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10207)
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a family of graph networks inspired by mechanisms existing between nodes on a graph. In recent years there has been an increased interest in GNN and their derivatives, i.e., Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Graph Recurrent Networks (GRN). An increase in their usability in computer vision is also observed. The number of GNN applications in this field continues to expand; it includes video analysis and understanding, action and behavior recognition, computational photography, image and video synthesis from zero or few shots, and many more. This contribution aims to collect papers published about GNN-based approaches towards computer vision. They are described and summarized from three perspectives. Firstly, we investigate the architectures of Graph Neural Networks and their derivatives used in this area to provide accurate and explainable recommendations for the ensuing investigations. As for the other aspect, we also present datasets used in these works. Finally, using graph analysis, we also examine relations between GNN-based studies in computer vision and potential sources of inspiration identified outside of this field. 

### [CSMPQ:Class Separability Based Mixed-Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10220)
Mixed-precision quantization has received increasing attention for its capability of reducing the computational burden and speeding up the inference time. Existing methods usually focus on the sensitivity of different network layers, which requires a time-consuming search or training process. To this end, a novel mixed-precision quantization method, termed CSMPQ, is proposed. Specifically, the TF-IDF metric that is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) is introduced to measure the class separability of layer-wise feature maps. Furthermore, a linear programming problem is designed to derive the optimal bit configuration for each layer. Without any iterative process, the proposed CSMPQ achieves better compression trade-offs than the state-of-the-art quantization methods. Specifically, CSMPQ achieves 73.03$\%$ Top-1 acc on ResNet-18 with only 59G BOPs for QAT, and 71.30$\%$ top-1 acc with only 1.5Mb on MobileNetV2 for PTQ. 

### [StyleDomain: Analysis of StyleSpace for Domain Adaptation of StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10229)
Domain adaptation of GANs is a problem of fine-tuning the state-of-the-art GAN models (e.g. StyleGAN) pretrained on a large dataset to a specific domain with few samples (e.g. painting faces, sketches, etc.). While there are a great number of methods that tackle this problem in different ways there are still many important questions that remain unanswered. In this paper, we provide a systematic and in-depth analysis of the domain adaptation problem of GANs, focusing on the StyleGAN model. First, we perform a detailed exploration of the most important parts of StyleGAN that are responsible for adapting the generator to a new domain depending on the similarity between the source and target domains. In particular, we show that affine layers of StyleGAN can be sufficient for fine-tuning to similar domains. Second, inspired by these findings, we investigate StyleSpace to utilize it for domain adaptation. We show that there exist directions in the StyleSpace that can adapt StyleGAN to new domains. Further, we examine these directions and discover their many surprising properties. Finally, we leverage our analysis and findings to deliver practical improvements and applications in such standard tasks as image-to-image translation and cross-domain morphing. 

### [Diff-Glat: Diffusion Glancing Transformer for Parallel Sequence to  Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10240)
For sequence generation, both autoregressive models and non-autoregressive models have been developed in recent years. Autoregressive models can achieve high generation quality, but the sequential decoding scheme causes slow decoding speed. Non-autoregressive models accelerate the inference speed with parallel decoding, while their generation quality still needs to be improved due to the difficulty of modeling multi-modalities in data. To address the multi-modality issue, we propose Diff-Glat, a non-autoregressive model featured with a modality diffusion process and residual glancing training. The modality diffusion process decomposes the modalities and reduces the modalities to learn for each transition. And the residual glancing sampling further smooths the modality learning procedures. Experiments demonstrate that, without using knowledge distillation data, Diff-Glat can achieve superior performance in both decoding efficiency and accuracy compared with the autoregressive Transformer. 

### [ARO-Net: Learning Neural Fields from Anchored Radial Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10275)
We introduce anchored radial observations (ARO), a novel shape encoding for learning neural field representation of shapes that is category-agnostic and generalizable amid significant shape variations. The main idea behind our work is to reason about shapes through partial observations from a set of viewpoints, called anchors. We develop a general and unified shape representation by employing a fixed set of anchors, via Fibonacci sampling, and designing a coordinate-based deep neural network to predict the occupancy value of a query point in space. Differently from prior neural implicit models, that use global shape feature, our shape encoder operates on contextual, query-specific features. To predict point occupancy, locally observed shape information from the perspective of the anchors surrounding the input query point are encoded and aggregated through an attention module, before implicit decoding is performed. We demonstrate the quality and generality of our network, coined ARO-Net, on surface reconstruction from sparse point clouds, with tests on novel and unseen object categories, "one-shape" training, and comparisons to state-of-the-art neural and classical methods for reconstruction and tessellation. 

### [Identifying and Manipulating the Personality Traits of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10276)
Psychology research has long explored aspects of human personality such as extroversion, agreeableness and emotional stability. Categorizations like the `Big Five' personality traits are commonly used to assess and diagnose personality types. In this work, we explore the question of whether the perceived personality in language models is exhibited consistently in their language generation. For example, is a language model such as GPT2 likely to respond in a consistent way if asked to go out to a party? We also investigate whether such personality traits can be controlled. We show that when provided different types of contexts (such as personality descriptions, or answers to diagnostic questions about personality traits), language models such as BERT and GPT2 can consistently identify and reflect personality markers in those contexts. This behavior illustrates an ability to be manipulated in a highly predictable way, and frames them as tools for identifying personality traits and controlling personas in applications such as dialog systems. We also contribute a crowd-sourced data-set of personality descriptions of human subjects paired with their `Big Five' personality assessment data, and a data-set of personality descriptions collated from Reddit. 

### [Which Pixel to Annotate: a Label-Efficient Nuclei Segmentation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10305)
Recently deep neural networks, which require a large amount of annotated samples, have been widely applied in nuclei instance segmentation of H\&E stained pathology images. However, it is inefficient and unnecessary to label all pixels for a dataset of nuclei images which usually contain similar and redundant patterns. Although unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods have been studied for nuclei segmentation, very few works have delved into the selective labeling of samples to reduce the workload of annotation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel full nuclei segmentation framework that chooses only a few image patches to be annotated, augments the training set from the selected samples, and achieves nuclei segmentation in a semi-supervised manner. In the proposed framework, we first develop a novel consistency-based patch selection method to determine which image patches are the most beneficial to the training. Then we introduce a conditional single-image GAN with a component-wise discriminator, to synthesize more training samples. Lastly, our proposed framework trains an existing segmentation model with the above augmented samples. The experimental results show that our proposed method could obtain the same-level performance as a fully-supervised baseline by annotating less than 5% pixels on some benchmarks. 

### [SeqDiffuSeq: Text Diffusion with Encoder-Decoder Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10325)
Diffusion model, a new generative modelling paradigm, has achieved great success in image, audio, and video generation. However, considering the discrete categorical nature of text, it is not trivial to extend continuous diffusion models to natural language, and text diffusion models are less studied. Sequence-to-sequence text generation is one of the essential natural language processing topics. In this work, we apply diffusion models to approach sequence-to-sequence text generation, and explore whether the superiority generation performance of diffusion model can transfer to natural language domain. We propose SeqDiffuSeq, a text diffusion model for sequence-to-sequence generation. SeqDiffuSeq uses an encoder-decoder Transformers architecture to model denoising function. In order to improve generation quality, SeqDiffuSeq combines the self-conditioning technique and a newly proposed adaptive noise schedule technique. The adaptive noise schedule has the difficulty of denoising evenly distributed across time steps, and considers exclusive noise schedules for tokens at different positional order. Experiment results illustrate the good performance on sequence-to-sequence generation in terms of text quality and inference time. 

### [Receptive Field Alignment Enables Transformer Length Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10356)
Length extrapolation is a desirable property that permits training a transformer language model on short sequences and retaining similar perplexities when the model is tested on substantially longer sequences. A relative positional embedding mechanism applied on the transformer self-attention matrix, ALiBi, demonstrates the length extrapolation property with the widest usage to date. In this paper, we show that ALiBi surprisingly does not utilize tokens further than the training sequence length, which can be explained by its implicit windowed attention effect that aligns the receptive field during training and testing stages. Inspired by ALiBi and the receptive filed alignment hypothesis, we propose another transformer positional embedding design named~\textbf{Sandwich} that uses longer than training sequence length information, and it is a greatly simplified formulation of the earliest proposed Sinusoidal positional embedding. Finally, we show that both ALiBi and Sandwich enable efficient inference thanks to their implicit windowed attention effect. 

### [A deep learning Attention model to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem and  the Pick-up and Delivery Problem with Time Windows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10399)
SNCF, the French public train company, is experimenting to develop new types of transportation services by tackling vehicle routing problems. While many deep learning models have been used to tackle efficiently vehicle routing problems, it is difficult to take into account time related constraints. In this paper, we solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) and the Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW) with a constructive iterative Deep Learning algorithm. We use an Attention Encoder-Decoder structure and design a novel insertion heuristic for the feasibility check of the CPDPTW. Our models yields results that are better than best known learning solutions on the CVRPTW. We show the feasibility of deep learning techniques for solving the CPDPTW but witness the limitations of our iterative approach in terms of computational complexity. 

### [Parameter-efficient Zero-shot Transfer for Cross-Language Dense  Retrieval with Adapters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10448)
A popular approach to creating a zero-shot cross-language retrieval model is to substitute a monolingual pretrained language model in the retrieval model with a multilingual pretrained language model such as Multilingual BERT. This multilingual model is fined-tuned to the retrieval task with monolingual data such as English MS MARCO using the same training recipe as the monolingual retrieval model used. However, such transferred models suffer from mismatches in the languages of the input text during training and inference. In this work, we propose transferring monolingual retrieval models using adapters, a parameter-efficient component for a transformer network. By adding adapters pretrained on language tasks for a specific language with task-specific adapters, prior work has shown that the adapter-enhanced models perform better than fine-tuning the entire model when transferring across languages in various NLP tasks. By constructing dense retrieval models with adapters, we show that models trained with monolingual data are more effective than fine-tuning the entire model when transferring to a Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) setting. However, we found that the prior suggestion of replacing the language adapters to match the target language at inference time is suboptimal for dense retrieval models. We provide an in-depth analysis of this discrepancy between other cross-language NLP tasks and CLIR. 

### [Is GPT-3 a Good Data Annotator?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10450)
GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a large-scale autoregressive language model developed by OpenAI, which has demonstrated impressive few-shot performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Hence, an intuitive application is to use it for data annotation. In this paper, we investigate whether GPT-3 can be used as a good data annotator for NLP tasks. Data annotation is the process of labeling data that could be used to train machine learning models. It is a crucial step in the development of NLP systems, as it allows the model to learn the relationship between the input data and the desired output. Given the impressive language capabilities of GPT-3, it is natural to wonder whether it can be used to effectively annotate data for NLP tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-3 as a data annotator by comparing it with traditional data annotation methods and analyzing its output on a range of tasks. Through this analysis, we aim to provide insight into the potential of GPT-3 as a general-purpose data annotator in NLP. 

### [Wind Power Scenario Generation Using Graph Convolutional Generative  Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10454)
Generating wind power scenarios is very important for studying the impacts of multiple wind farms that are interconnected to the grid. We develop a graph convolutional generative adversarial network (GCGAN) approach by leveraging GAN's capability in generating large number of realistic scenarios without using statistical modeling. Unlike existing GAN-based wind power data generation approaches, we design GAN's hidden layers to match the underlying spatial and temporal characteristics. We advocate to use graph filters to embed the spatial correlation among multiple wind farms, and a one-dimensional (1D) convolutional layer for representing the temporal feature filters. The proposed graph and feature filter designs significantly reduce the GAN model complexity, leading to improvements on the training efficiency and computation complexity. Numerical results using real wind power data from Australia demonstrate that the scenarios generated by the proposed GCGAN exhibit more realistic spatial and temporal statistics than other GAN-based outputs. 

### [SimpleStyle: An Adaptable Style Transfer Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10498)
Attribute Controlled Text Rewriting, also known as text style transfer, has received significant attention in the natural language generation community due to its crucial role in controllable natural language generation systems. In this work we present SimpleStyle a minimalist yet effective approach for attribute controlled text rewriting based on a simple mechanism composed of two ingredients. controlled denoising and output filtering. Despite the simplicity of our approach, which can be succinctly explained with just a few lines of code, it is competitive with previous state-of-the-art methods both in automatic and in human evaluations. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our system, by applying it to real-world data from social networks. Additionally, we introduce a soft masking sampling technique that further improves the performance of the system. We also show that feeding the output of our system into a text-to-text student model can produce high-quality results without the need for additional filtering. Finally, we suggest that our method can solve the fundamental missing baseline absence that holding progress in the field by offering our protocol as a simple, adaptive and very strong baseline for works wish to make incremental advancements in the field of attribute controlled text rewriting. 

### [Mini-Model Adaptation: Efficiently Extending Pretrained Models to New  Languages via Aligned Shallow Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10503)
Prior work has shown that it is possible to expand pretrained Masked Language Models (MLMs) to new languages by learning a new set of embeddings, while keeping the transformer body frozen. Despite learning a small subset of parameters, this approach is not compute-efficient, as training the new embeddings requires a full forward and backward pass over the entire model. In this work, we propose mini-model adaptation, a compute-efficient alternative that builds a shallow mini-model from a fraction of a large model's parameters. New language-specific embeddings can then be efficiently trained over the mini-model, and plugged into the aligned large model for rapid cross-lingual transfer. We explore two approaches to learn mini-models: MiniJoint, which jointly pretrains the primary model and the mini-model using a single transformer with a secondary MLM head at a middle layer; and MiniPost, where we start from a regular pretrained model and build a mini-model by extracting and freezing a few layers and learning a small number of parameters on top. Experiments on XNLI, MLQA and PAWS-X show that mini-model adaptation matches the performance of the standard approach using up to 2.4x less compute. 

### [Combining machine-learned and empirical force fields with the parareal  algorithm: application to the diffusion of atomistic defects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10508)
We numerically investigate an adaptive version of the parareal algorithm in the context of molecular dynamics. This adaptive variant has been originally introduced in [F. Legoll, T. Lelievre and U. Sharma, SISC 2022]. We focus here on test cases of physical interest where the dynamics of the system is modelled by the Langevin equation and is simulated using the molecular dynamics software LAMMPS. In this work, the parareal algorithm uses a family of machine-learning spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP) as fine, reference, potentials and embedded-atom method potentials (EAM) as coarse potentials. We consider a self-interstitial atom in a tungsten lattice and compute the average residence time of the system in metastable states. Our numerical results demonstrate significant computational gains using the adaptive parareal algorithm in comparison to a sequential integration of the Langevin dynamics. We also identify a large regime of numerical parameters for which statistical accuracy is reached without being a consequence of trajectorial accuracy. 

### [Transformers Go for the LOLs: Generating (Humourous) Titles from  Scientific Abstracts End-to-End](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10522)
We consider the end-to-end abstract-to-title generation problem, exploring seven recent transformer based models (including ChatGPT) fine-tuned on more than 30k abstract-title pairs from NLP and machine learning venues. As an extension, we also consider the harder problem of generating humorous paper titles. For the latter, we compile the first large-scale humor annotated dataset for scientific papers in the NLP/ML domains, comprising almost 2.5k titles. We evaluate all models using human and automatic metrics. Our human evaluation suggests that our best end-to-end system performs similarly to human authors (but arguably slightly worse). Generating funny titles is more difficult, however, and our automatic systems clearly underperform relative to humans and often learn dataset artefacts of humor. Finally, ChatGPT, without any fine-tuning, performs on the level of our best fine-tuned system. 

### [SLUE Phase-2: A Benchmark Suite of Diverse Spoken Language Understanding  Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10525)
Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks have been studied for many decades in the speech research community, but have not received as much attention as lower-level tasks like speech and speaker recognition. In particular, there are not nearly as many SLU task benchmarks, and many of the existing ones use data that is not freely available to all researchers. Recent work has begun to introduce such benchmark datasets for several tasks. In this work, we introduce several new annotated SLU benchmark tasks based on freely available speech data, which complement existing benchmarks and address gaps in the SLU evaluation landscape. We contribute four tasks: question answering and summarization involve inference over longer speech sequences; named entity localization addresses the speech-specific task of locating the targeted content in the signal; dialog act classification identifies the function of a given speech utterance. We follow the blueprint of the Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) benchmark suite. In order to facilitate the development of SLU models that leverage the success of pre-trained speech representations, we will be publishing for each task (i) annotations for a relatively small fine-tuning set, (ii) annotated development and test sets, and (iii) baseline models for easy reproducibility and comparisons. In this work, we present the details of data collection and annotation and the performance of the baseline models. We also perform sensitivity analysis of pipeline models' performance (speech recognizer + text model) to the speech recognition accuracy, using more than 20 state-of-the-art speech recognition models. 

### [Does CLIP Bind Concepts? Probing Compositionality in Large Image Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10537)
Large-scale models combining text and images have made incredible progress in recent years. However, they can still fail at tasks requiring compositional knowledge, such as correctly picking out a red cube from a picture of multiple shapes. We examine the ability of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), to caption images requiring compositional knowledge. We implement five compositional language models to probe the kinds of structure that CLIP may be using, and develop a novel training algorithm, Compositional Skipgram for Images (CoSI), to train these models. We look at performance in attribute-based tasks, requiring the identification of a particular combination of attribute and object (such as "red cube"), and in relational settings, where the spatial relation between two shapes (such as "cube behind sphere") must be identified. We find that in some conditions, CLIP is able to learn attribute-object labellings, and to generalize to unseen attribute-object combinations. However, we also see evidence that CLIP is not able to bind features together reliably. Moreover, CLIP is not able to reliably learn relations between objects, whereas some compositional models are able to learn these perfectly. Of the five models we developed, none were able to generalize to unseen relations. 

### [Pretraining Without Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10544)
Transformers have been essential to pretraining success in NLP. Other architectures have been used, but require attention layers to match benchmark accuracy. This work explores pretraining without attention. We test recently developed routing layers based on state-space models (SSM) and model architectures based on multiplicative gating. Used together these modeling choices have a large impact on pretraining accuracy. Empirically the proposed Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS) replicates BERT pretraining results without attention and can be extended to long-form pretraining of 4096 tokens without approximation. 

### [Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization for Vision-Language  Relation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10549)
Despite recent progress towards scaling up multimodal vision-language models, these models are still known to struggle on compositional generalization benchmarks such as Winoground. We find that a critical component lacking from current vision-language models is relation-level alignment: the ability to match directional semantic relations in text (e.g., "mug in grass") with spatial relationships in the image (e.g., the position of the mug relative to the grass). To tackle this problem, we show that relation alignment can be enforced by encouraging the directed language attention from 'mug' to 'grass' (capturing the semantic relation 'in') to match the directed visual attention from the mug to the grass. Tokens and their corresponding objects are softly identified using the cross-modal attention. We prove that this notion of soft relation alignment is equivalent to enforcing congruence between vision and language attention matrices under a 'change of basis' provided by the cross-modal attention matrix. Intuitively, our approach projects visual attention into the language attention space to calculate its divergence from the actual language attention, and vice versa. We apply our Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization (CACR) loss to UNITER and improve on the state-of-the-art approach to Winoground. 

### [A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10554)
Position modeling plays a critical role in Transformers. In this paper, we focus on length extrapolation, i.e., training on short texts while evaluating longer sequences. We define attention resolution as an indicator of extrapolation. Then we propose two designs to improve the above metric of Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a relative position embedding to explicitly maximize attention resolution. Moreover, we use blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution. We evaluate different Transformer variants with language modeling. Experimental results show that our model achieves strong performance in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. The code will be available at https://aka.ms/LeX-Transformer. 

### [Unleashing the Power of Visual Prompting At the Pixel Level](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10556)
This paper presents a simple and effective visual prompting method for adapting pre-trained models to downstream recognition tasks. Our method includes two key designs. First, rather than directly adding together the prompt and the image, we treat the prompt as an extra and independent learnable component. We show that the strategy of reconciling the prompt and the image matters, and find that warping the prompt around a properly shrinked image empirically works the best. Second, we re-introduce two "old tricks" commonly used in building transferable adversarial examples, i.e., input diversity and gradient normalization, into visual prompting. These techniques improve optimization and enable the prompt to generalize better. We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Using a CLIP model, our prompting method sets a new record of 82.8% average accuracy across 12 popular classification datasets, substantially surpassing the prior art by +5.6%. It is worth noting that this prompting performance already outperforms linear probing by +2.1% and can even match fully fine-tuning in certain datasets. In addition, our prompting method shows competitive performance across different data scales and against distribution shifts. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EVP. 

### [Why Can GPT Learn In-Context? Language Models Secretly Perform Gradient  Descent as Meta Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10559)
Large pretrained language models have shown surprising In-Context Learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without additional parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, the working mechanism of ICL still remains an open problem. In order to better understand how ICL works, this paper explains language models as meta optimizers and understands ICL as a kind of implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that the Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent based optimization. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT first produces meta gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare the behavior of ICL and explicit finetuning based on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. The results prove that ICL behaves similarly to explicit finetuning at the prediction level, the representation level, and the attention behavior level. Further, inspired by our understanding of meta optimization, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with the momentum-based gradient descent algorithm. Its consistently better performance over vanilla attention supports our understanding again from another aspect, and more importantly, it shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model designing. 

### [Conditioned Generative Transformers for Histopathology Image Synthetic  Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09977)
Deep learning networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on medical image analysis tasks. However, the majority of the works rely heavily on abundantly labeled data, which necessitates extensive involvement of domain experts. Vision transformer (ViT) based generative adversarial networks (GANs) recently demonstrated superior potential in general image synthesis, yet are less explored for histopathology images. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a pure ViT-based conditional GAN model for histopathology image synthetic augmentation. To alleviate training instability and improve generation robustness, we first introduce a conditioned class projection method to facilitate class separation. We then implement a multi-loss weighing function to dynamically balance the losses between classification tasks. We further propose a selective augmentation mechanism to actively choose the appropriate generated images and bring additional performance improvements. Extensive experiments on the histopathology datasets show that leveraging our synthetic augmentation framework results in significant and consistent improvements in classification performance. 

### [Galaxy Image Classification using Hierarchical Data Learning with  Weighted Sampling and Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10081)
With the development of a series of Galaxy sky surveys in recent years, the observations increased rapidly, which makes the research of machine learning methods for galaxy image recognition a hot topic. Available automatic galaxy image recognition researches are plagued by the large differences in similarity between categories, the imbalance of data between different classes, and the discrepancy between the discrete representation of Galaxy classes and the essentially gradual changes from one morphological class to the adjacent class (DDRGC). These limitations have motivated several astronomers and machine learning experts to design projects with improved galaxy image recognition capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel learning method, ``Hierarchical Imbalanced data learning with Weighted sampling and Label smoothing" (HIWL). The HIWL consists of three key techniques respectively dealing with the above-mentioned three problems: (1) Designed a hierarchical galaxy classification model based on an efficient backbone network; (2) Utilized a weighted sampling scheme to deal with the imbalance problem; (3) Adopted a label smoothing technique to alleviate the DDRGC problem. We applied this method to galaxy photometric images from the Galaxy Zoo-The Galaxy Challenge, exploring the recognition of completely round smooth, in between smooth, cigar-shaped, edge-on and spiral. The overall classification accuracy is 96.32\%, and some superiorities of the HIWL are shown based on recall, precision, and F1-Score in comparing with some related works. In addition, we also explored the visualization of the galaxy image features and model attention to understand the foundations of the proposed scheme. 

### [End to End Generative Meta Curriculum Learning For Medical Data  Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10086)
Current medical image synthetic augmentation techniques rely on intensive use of generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the nature of GAN architecture leads to heavy computational resources to produce synthetic images and the augmentation process requires multiple stages to complete. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel generative meta curriculum learning method that trains the task-specific model (student) end-to-end with only one additional teacher model. The teacher learns to generate curriculum to feed into the student model for data augmentation and guides the student to improve performance in a meta-learning style. In contrast to the generator and discriminator in GAN, which compete with each other, the teacher and student collaborate to improve the student's performance on the target tasks. Extensive experiments on the histopathology datasets show that leveraging our framework results in significant and consistent improvements in classification performance. 

### [Diffusion equations with spatially dependent coefficients and fractal  Cauer-type networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10118)
We give a self-contained proof of the connection existing between diffusion equations with spatially dependent coefficients and fractal Cauer-type networks initiated by J. Sabatier in 2020 and discussed in more details in [J. Sabatier and al., Fractional behaviours modelling, Springer, 2022]. 

### [Machine Learning and Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory in Two Spatial  Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10478)
A computational framework that leverages data from self-consistent field theory simulations with deep learning to accelerate the exploration of parameter space for block copolymers is presented. This is a substantial two-dimensional extension of the framework introduced in [1]. Several innovations and improvements are proposed. (1) A Sobolev space-trained, convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to handle the exponential dimension increase of the discretized, local average monomer density fields and to strongly enforce both spatial translation and rotation invariance of the predicted, field-theoretic intensive Hamiltonian. (2) A generative adversarial network (GAN) is introduced to efficiently and accurately predict saddle point, local average monomer density fields without resorting to gradient descent methods that employ the training set. This GAN approach yields important savings of both memory and computational cost. (3) The proposed machine learning framework is successfully applied to 2D cell size optimization as a clear illustration of its broad potential to accelerate the exploration of parameter space for discovering polymer nanostructures. Extensions to three-dimensional phase discovery appear to be feasible.
