### [ML-powered KQI estimation for XR services. A case study on 360-Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12002)
The arise of cutting-edge technologies and services such as XR promise to change the concepts of how day-to-day things are done. At the same time, the appearance of modern and decentralized architectures approaches has given birth to a new generation of mobile networks such as 5G, as well as outlining the roadmap for B5G and posterior. These networks are expected to be the enablers for bringing to life the Metaverse and other futuristic approaches. In this sense, this work presents an ML-based (Machine Learning) framework that allows the estimation of service Key Quality Indicators (KQIs). For this, only information reachable to operators is required, such as statistics and configuration parameters from these networks. This strategy prevents operators from avoiding intrusion into the user data and guaranteeing privacy. To test this proposal, 360-Video has been selected as a use case of Virtual Reality (VR), from which specific KQIs are estimated such as video resolution, frame rate, initial startup time, throughput, and latency, among others. To select the best model for each KQI, a search grid with a cross-validation strategy has been used to determine the best hyperparameter tuning. To boost the creation of each KQI model, feature engineering techniques together with cross-validation strategies have been used. The performance is assessed using MAE (Mean Average Error) and the prediction time. The outcomes point out that KNR (K-Near Neighbors) and RF (Random Forest) are the best algorithms in combination with Feature Selection techniques. Likewise, this work will help as a baseline for E2E-Quality-of-Experience-based network management working in conjunction with network slicing, virtualization, and MEC, among other enabler technologies. 

### [Asymptotic--preserving and energy stable dynamical low-rank  approximation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12012)
Radiation transport problems are posed in a high-dimensional phase space, limiting the use of finely resolved numerical simulations. An emerging tool to efficiently reduce computational costs and memory footprint in such settings is dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA). Despite its efficiency, numerical methods for DLRA need to be carefully constructed to guarantee stability while preserving crucial properties of the original problem. Important physical effects that one likes to preserve with DLRA include capturing the diffusion limit in the high-scattering regimes as well as dissipating energy. In this work we propose and analyze a dynamical low-rank method based on the "unconventional" basis-update & Galerkin step integrator. We show that this method is asymptotic-preserving, i.e., it captures the diffusion limit, and energy stable under a CFL condition. The derived CFL condition captures the transition from the hyperbolic to the parabolic regime when approaching the diffusion limit. 

### [When are Lemons Purple? The Concept Association Bias of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12043)
Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have shown impressive performance on zero-shot image classification and image-to-text retrieval. However, such zero-shot performance of CLIP-based models does not realize in tasks that require a finer-grained correspondence between vision and language, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). We investigate why this is the case, and report an interesting phenomenon of CLIP, which we call the Concept Association Bias (CAB), as a potential cause of the difficulty of applying CLIP to VQA and similar tasks. CAB is especially apparent when two concepts are present in the given image while a text prompt only contains a single concept. In such a case, we find that CLIP tends to treat input as a bag of concepts and attempts to fill in the other missing concept crossmodally, leading to an unexpected zero-shot prediction. For example, when asked for the color of a lemon in an image, CLIP predicts ``purple'' if the image contains a lemon and an eggplant. We demonstrate the Concept Association Bias of CLIP by showing that CLIP's zero-shot classification performance greatly suffers when there is a strong concept association between an object (e.g. lemon) and an attribute (e.g. its color). On the other hand, when the association between object and attribute is weak, we do not see this phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that CAB is significantly mitigated when we enable CLIP to learn deeper structure across image and text embeddings by adding an additional Transformer on top of CLIP and fine-tuning it on VQA. We find that across such fine-tuned variants of CLIP, the strength of CAB in a model predicts how well it performs on VQA.

Meaning: Deep bidirectional and autoregressive representation improves patient outcome prediction. 

### [Anomaly Detection using Ensemble Classification and Evidence Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12092)
Multi-class ensemble classification remains a popular focus of investigation within the research community. The popularization of cloud services has sped up their adoption due to the ease of deploying large-scale machine-learning models. It has also drawn the attention of the industrial sector because of its ability to identify common problems in production. However, there are challenges to conform an ensemble classifier, namely a proper selection and effective training of the pool of classifiers, the definition of a proper architecture for multi-class classification, and uncertainty quantification of the ensemble classifier. The robustness and effectiveness of the ensemble classifier lie in the selection of the pool of classifiers, as well as in the learning process. Hence, the selection and the training procedure of the pool of classifiers play a crucial role. An (ensemble) classifier learns to detect the classes that were used during the supervised training. However, when injecting data with unknown conditions, the trained classifier will intend to predict the classes learned during the training. To this end, the uncertainty of the individual and ensemble classifier could be used to assess the learning capability. We present a novel approach for novel detection using ensemble classification and evidence theory. A pool selection strategy is presented to build a solid ensemble classifier. We present an architecture for multi-class ensemble classification and an approach to quantify the uncertainty of the individual classifiers and the ensemble classifier. We use uncertainty for the anomaly detection approach. Finally, we use the benchmark Tennessee Eastman to perform experiments to test the ensemble classifier's prediction and anomaly detection capabilities. 

### [HiTSKT: A Hierarchical Transformer Model for Session-Aware Knowledge  Tracing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12139)
Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to leverage students' learning histories to estimate their mastery levels on a set of pre-defined skills, based on which the corresponding future performance can be accurately predicted. In practice, a student's learning history comprises answers to sets of massed questions, each known as a session, rather than merely being a sequence of independent answers. Theoretically, within and across these sessions, students' learning dynamics can be very different. Therefore, how to effectively model the dynamics of students' knowledge states within and across the sessions is crucial for handling the KT problem. Most existing KT models treat student's learning records as a single continuing sequence, without capturing the sessional shift of students' knowledge state. To address the above issue, we propose a novel hierarchical transformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an interaction(-level) encoder to capture the knowledge a student acquires within a session, and a session(-level) encoder to summarise acquired knowledge across the past sessions. To predict an interaction in the current session, a knowledge retriever integrates the summarised past-session knowledge with the previous interactions' information into proper knowledge representations. These representations are then used to compute the student's current knowledge state. Additionally, to model the student's long-term forgetting behaviour across the sessions, a power-law-decay attention mechanism is designed and deployed in the session encoder, allowing it to emphasize more on the recent sessions. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HiTSKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets compared with six state-of-the-art KT models. 

### [PanoViT: Vision Transformer for Room Layout Estimation from a Single  Panoramic Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12156)
In this paper, we propose PanoViT, a panorama vision transformer to estimate the room layout from a single panoramic image. Compared to CNN models, our PanoViT is more proficient in learning global information from the panoramic image for the estimation of complex room layouts. Considering the difference between a perspective image and an equirectangular image, we design a novel recurrent position embedding and a patch sampling method for the processing of panoramic images. In addition to extracting global information, PanoViT also includes a frequency-domain edge enhancement module and a 3D loss to extract local geometric features in a panoramic image. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in room layout prediction accuracy. 

### [Monotonous Parameter Estimation of One Class of Nonlinearly  Parameterized Regressions without Overparameterization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12184)
The estimation law of unknown parameters vector ${\theta}$ is proposed for one class of nonlinearly parametrized regression equations $y\left( t \right) = \Omega \left( t \right)\Theta \left( \theta \right)$. We restrict our attention to parametrizations that are widely obtained in practical scenarios when polynomials or power functions in $\theta$ are used to form $y(t)$. For them we introduce a new "linearizability" assumption that a mapping from overparametrized vector of parameters $\Theta \left( \theta \right)$ to original one $\theta$ exists in terms of standard inverse algebraic function. Under such assumption and weak requirement of the regressor finite excitation, on the basis of dynamic regressor extension and mixing technique we propose a procedure to reduce the nonlinear regression equation to the linear parameterization without application of singularity causing operations and the need to identify the overparametrized parameters vector. As a result, an estimation law with exponential convergence rate is derived, which, unlike known solutions, ($\textit{i}$) does not require a strict $\textit{P}$-monotonicity condition to be met and a priori information about $\theta$ to be known, ($\textit{ii}$) ensures elementwise monotonicity for the parameter error vector. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with both academic example and 2-DOF robot manipulator control problem. 

### [Look Around! A Neighbor Relation Graph Learning Framework for Real  Estate Appraisal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12190)
Real estate appraisal is a crucial issue for urban applications, which aims to value the properties on the market. Traditional methods perform appraisal based on the domain knowledge, but suffer from the efforts of hand-crafted design. Recently, several methods have been developed to automatize the valuation process by taking the property trading transaction into account when estimating the property value. However, existing methods only consider the real estate itself, ignoring the relation between the properties. Moreover, naively aggregating the information of neighbors fails to model the relationships between the transactions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Neighbor Relation Graph Learning Framework (ReGram) by incorporating the relation between target transaction and surrounding neighbors with the attention mechanism. To model the influence between communities, we integrate the environmental information and the past price of each transaction from other communities. Moreover, since the target transactions in different regions share some similarities and differences of characteristics, we introduce a dynamic adapter to model the different distributions of the target transactions based on the input-related kernel weights. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset with various scenarios demonstrate that ReGram robustly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of each component in ReGram. 

### [Structure-guided Image Outpainting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12326)
Deep learning techniques have made considerable progress in image inpainting, restoration, and reconstruction in the last few years. Image outpainting, also known as image extrapolation, lacks attention and practical approaches to be fulfilled, owing to difficulties caused by large-scale area loss and less legitimate neighboring information. These difficulties have made outpainted images handled by most of the existing models unrealistic to human eyes and spatially inconsistent. When upsampling through deconvolution to generate fake content, the naive generation methods may lead to results lacking high-frequency details and structural authenticity. Therefore, as our novelties to handle image outpainting problems, we introduce structural prior as a condition to optimize the generation quality and a new semantic embedding term to enhance perceptual sanity. we propose a deep learning method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and condition edges as structural prior in order to assist the generation. We use a multi-phase adversarial training scheme that comprises edge inference training, contents inpainting training, and joint training. The newly added semantic embedding loss is proved effective in practice. 

### [Linear features segmentation from aerial images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12327)
The rapid development of remote sensing technologies have gained significant attention due to their ability to accurately localize, classify, and segment objects from aerial images. These technologies are commonly used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution cameras or sensors to capture data over large areas. This data is useful for various applications, such as monitoring and inspecting cities, towns, and terrains. In this paper, we presented a method for classifying and segmenting city road traffic dashed lines from aerial images using deep learning models such as U-Net and SegNet. The annotated data is used to train these models, which are then used to classify and segment the aerial image into two classes: dashed lines and non-dashed lines. However, the deep learning model may not be able to identify all dashed lines due to poor painting or occlusion by trees or shadows. To address this issue, we proposed a method to add missed lines to the segmentation output. We also extracted the x and y coordinates of each dashed line from the segmentation output, which can be used by city planners to construct a CAD file for digital visualization of the roads. 

### [Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann waveform relaxation algorithms for  time fractional sub-diffusion and diffusion-wave equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12366)
In this article, we have studied the convergence behavior of the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann- Neumann waveform relaxation algorithms for time-fractional sub-diffusion and diffusion-wave equations in 1D & 2D for regular domains, where the dimensionless diffusion coefficient takes different constant values in different subdomains. We first observe that different diffusion coefficients lead to different relaxation parameters for optimal convergence. Using these optimal relaxation parameters, our analysis estimates the slow superlinear convergence of the algorithms when the fractional order of the time derivative is close to zero, almost finite step convergence when the order is close to two, and in between, the superlinear convergence becomes faster as fractional order increases. So, we have successfully caught the transition of convergence rate with the change of fractional order of the time derivative in estimates and verified them with numerical experiments. 

### [Text classification in shipping industry using unsupervised models and  Transformer based supervised models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12407)
Obtaining labelled data in a particular context could be expensive and time consuming. Although different algorithms, including unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-learning have been adopted, the performance of text classification varies with context. Given the lack of labelled dataset, we proposed a novel and simple unsupervised text classification model to classify cargo content in international shipping industry using the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) codes. Our method stems from representing words using pretrained Glove Word Embeddings and finding the most likely label using Cosine Similarity. To compare unsupervised text classification model with supervised classification, we also applied several Transformer models to classify cargo content. Due to lack of training data, the SITC numerical codes and the corresponding textual descriptions were used as training data. A small number of manually labelled cargo content data was used to evaluate the classification performances of the unsupervised classification and the Transformer based supervised classification. The comparison reveals that unsupervised classification significantly outperforms Transformer based supervised classification even after increasing the size of the training dataset by 30%. Lacking training data is a key bottleneck that prohibits deep learning models (such as Transformers) from successful practical applications. Unsupervised classification can provide an alternative efficient and effective method to classify text when there is scarce training data. 

### [Benchmark for Uncertainty & Robustness in Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12411)
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is crucial for real-world applications, especially in data-hungry domains such as healthcare and self-driving cars. In addition to a lack of labeled data, these applications also suffer from distributional shifts. Therefore, an SSL method should provide robust generalization and uncertainty estimation in the test dataset to be considered a reliable model in such high-stakes domains. However, existing approaches often focus on generalization, without evaluating the model's uncertainty. The ability to compare SSL techniques for improving these estimates is therefore critical for research on the reliability of self-supervision models. In this paper, we explore variants of SSL methods, including Jigsaw Puzzles, Context, Rotation, Geometric Transformations Prediction for vision, as well as BERT and GPT for language tasks. We train SSL in auxiliary learning for vision and pre-training for language model, then evaluate the generalization (in-out classification accuracy) and uncertainty (expected calibration error) across different distribution covariate shift datasets, including MNIST-C, CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10.1, and MNLI. Our goal is to create a benchmark with outputs from experiments, providing a starting point for new SSL methods in Reliable Machine Learning. All source code to reproduce results is available at https://github.com/hamanhbui/reliable_ssl_baselines. 

### [MicroBERT: Effective Training of Low-resource Monolingual BERTs through  Parameter Reduction and Multitask Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12510)
Transformer language models (TLMs) are critical for most NLP tasks, but they are difficult to create for low-resource languages because of how much pretraining data they require. In this work, we investigate two techniques for training monolingual TLMs in a low-resource setting: greatly reducing TLM size, and complementing the masked language modeling objective with two linguistically rich supervised tasks (part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). Results from 7 diverse languages indicate that our model, MicroBERT, is able to produce marked improvements in downstream task evaluations relative to a typical monolingual TLM pretraining approach. Specifically, we find that monolingual MicroBERT models achieve gains of up to 18% for parser LAS and 11% for NER F1 compared to a multilingual baseline, mBERT, while having less than 1% of its parameter count. We conclude reducing TLM parameter count and using labeled data for pretraining low-resource TLMs can yield large quality benefits and in some cases produce models that outperform multilingual approaches. 

### [Stop using the elbow criterion for k-means and how to choose the number  of clusters instead](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12189)
A major challenge when using k-means clustering often is how to choose the parameter k, the number of clusters. In this letter, we want to point out that it is very easy to draw poor conclusions from a common heuristic, the "elbow method". Better alternatives have been known in literature for a long time, and we want to draw attention to some of these easy to use options, that often perform better. This letter is a call to stop using the elbow method altogether, because it severely lacks theoretic support, and we want to encourage educators to discuss the problems of the method -- if introducing it in class at all -- and teach alternatives instead, while researchers and reviewers should reject conclusions drawn from the elbow method. 

### [Collective Intelligent Strategy for Improved Segmentation of COVID-19  from CT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12264)
The devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic makes it imperative to design automated techniques for a fast and accurate detection. We propose a novel non-invasive tool, using deep learning and imaging, for delineating COVID-19 infection in lungs. The Ensembling Attention-based Multi-scaled Convolution network (EAMC), employing Leave-One-Patient-Out (LOPO) training, exhibits high sensitivity and precision in outlining infected regions along with assessment of severity. The Attention module combines contextual with local information, at multiple scales, for accurate segmentation. Ensemble learning integrates heterogeneity of decision through different base classifiers. The superiority of EAMC, even with severe class imbalance, is established through comparison with existing state-of-the-art learning models over four publicly-available COVID-19 datasets. The results are suggestive of the relevance of deep learning in providing assistive intelligence to medical practitioners, when they are overburdened with patients as in pandemics. Its clinical significance lies in its unprecedented scope in providing low-cost decision-making for patients lacking specialized healthcare at remote locations. 

### [Statistical Distance Based Deterministic Offspring Selection in SMC  Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12290)
Over the years, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and, equivalently, particle filter (PF) theory has gained substantial attention from researchers. However, the performance of the resampling methodology, also known as offspring selection, has not advanced recently. We propose two deterministic offspring selection methods, which strive to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the total variation (TV) distance, respectively, between the particle distribution prior and subsequent to the offspring selection. By reducing the statistical distance between the selected offspring and the joint distribution, we obtain a heuristic search procedure that performs superior to a maximum likelihood search in precisely those contexts where the latter performs better than an SMC. For SMC and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC), our proposed offspring selection methods always outperform or compare favorably with the two state-of-the-art resampling schemes on two models commonly used as benchmarks from the literature. 

### [HAC-Net: A Hybrid Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network for  Highly Accurate Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12440)
Applying deep learning concepts from image detection and graph theory has greatly advanced protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, a challenge with enormous ramifications for both drug discovery and protein engineering. We build upon these advances by designing a novel deep learning architecture consisting of a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network utilizing channel-wise attention and two graph convolutional networks utilizing attention-based aggregation of node features. HAC-Net (Hybrid Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network) obtains state-of-the-art results on the PDBbind v.2016 core set, the most widely recognized benchmark in the field. We extensively assess the generalizability of our model using multiple train-test splits, each of which maximizes differences between either protein structures, protein sequences, or ligand extended-connectivity fingerprints. Furthermore, we perform 10-fold cross-validation with a similarity cutoff between SMILES strings of ligands in the training and test sets, and also evaluate the performance of HAC-Net on lower-quality data. We envision that this model can be extended to a broad range of supervised learning problems related to structure-based biomolecular property prediction. All of our software is available as open source at https://github.com/gregory-kyro/HAC-Net/.
