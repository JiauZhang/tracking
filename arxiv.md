        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: NeRF provides unparalleled fidelity of novel view synthesis: rendering a 3D scene from an arbitrary viewpoint. NeRF requires training on a large number of views that fully cover a scene, which limits its applicability. While these issues can be addressed by learning a prior over scenes in various forms, previous approaches have been either applied to overly simple scenes or struggling to render unobserved parts. We introduce Laser-NV: a generative model which achieves high modelling capacity, and which is based on a set-valued latent representation modelled by normalizing flows. Similarly to previous amortized approaches, Laser-NV learns structure from multiple scenes and is capable of fast, feed-forward inference from few views. To encourage higher rendering fidelity and consistency with observed views, Laser-NV further incorporates a geometry-informed attention mechanism over the observed views. Laser-NV further produces diverse and plausible completions of occluded parts of a scene while remaining consistent with observations. Laser-NV shows state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis quality when evaluated on ShapeNet and on a novel simulated City dataset, which features high uncertainty in the unobserved regions of the scene. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Carefully designed activation functions can improve the performance of neural networks in many machine learning tasks. However, it is difficult for humans to construct optimal activation functions, and current activation function search algorithms are prohibitively expensive. This paper aims to improve the state of the art through three steps: First, the benchmark datasets Act-Bench-CNN, Act-Bench-ResNet, and Act-Bench-ViT were created by training convolutional, residual, and vision transformer architectures from scratch with 2,913 systematically generated activation functions. Second, a characterization of the benchmark space was developed, leading to a new surrogate-based method for optimization. More specifically, the spectrum of the Fisher information matrix associated with the model's predictive distribution at initialization and the activation function's output distribution were found to be highly predictive of performance. Third, the surrogate was used to discover improved activation functions in CIFAR-100 and ImageNet tasks. Each of these steps is a contribution in its own right; together they serve as a practical and theoretical foundation for further research on activation function optimization.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Self-supervised methods have showed promising results on depth estimation task. However, previous methods estimate the target depth map and camera ego-motion simultaneously, underusing multi-frame correlation information and ignoring the motion of dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Dyna-Depthformer framework, which predicts scene depth and 3D motion field jointly and aggregates multi-frame information with transformer. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we leverage multi-view correlation through a series of self- and cross-attention layers in order to obtain enhanced depth feature representation. Specifically, we use the perspective transformation to acquire the initial reference point, and use deformable attention to reduce the computational cost. Second, we propose a warping-based Motion Network to estimate the motion field of dynamic objects without using semantic prior. To improve the motion field predictions, we propose an iterative optimization strategy, together with a sparsity-regularized loss. The entire pipeline achieves end-to-end self-supervised training by constructing a minimum reprojection loss. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The coordination of robotic swarms and the remote wireless control of industrial systems are among the major use cases for 5G and beyond systems: in these cases, the massive amounts of sensory information that needs to be shared over the wireless medium can overload even high-capacity connections. Consequently, solving the effective communication problem by optimizing the transmission strategy to discard irrelevant information can provide a significant advantage, but is often a very complex task. In this work, we consider a prototypal system in which an observer must communicate its sensory data to an actor controlling a task (e.g., a mobile robot in a factory). We then model it as a remote Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), considering the effect of adopting semantic and effective communication-oriented solutions on the overall system performance. We split the communication problem by considering an ensemble Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) encoding, and train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to dynamically adapt the quantization level, considering both the current state of the environment and the memory of past messages. We tested the proposed approach on the well-known CartPole reference control problem, obtaining a significant performance increase over traditional approaches <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce SceneDiffuser, a conditional generative model for 3D scene understanding. SceneDiffuser provides a unified model for solving scene-conditioned generation, optimization, and planning. In contrast to prior works, SceneDiffuser is intrinsically scene-aware, physics-based, and goal-oriented. With an iterative sampling strategy, SceneDiffuser jointly formulates the scene-aware generation, physics-based optimization, and goal-oriented planning via a diffusion-based denoising process in a fully differentiable fashion. Such a design alleviates the discrepancies among different modules and the posterior collapse of previous scene-conditioned generative models. We evaluate SceneDiffuser with various 3D scene understanding tasks, including human pose and motion generation, dexterous grasp generation, path planning for 3D navigation, and motion planning for robot arms. The results show significant improvements compared with previous models, demonstrating the tremendous potential of SceneDiffuser for the broad community of 3D scene understanding. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Designing an efficient yet deployment-friendly 3D backbone to handle sparse point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D object detection. Compared with the customized sparse convolution, the attention mechanism in Transformers is more appropriate for flexibly modeling long-range relationships and is easier to be deployed in real-world applications. However, due to the sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to apply a standard transformer on sparse points. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer (DSVT), a single-stride window-based voxel Transformer backbone for outdoor 3D object detection. In order to efficiently process sparse points in parallel, we propose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions a series of local regions in each window according to its sparsity and then computes the features of all regions in a fully parallel manner. To allow the cross-set connection, we design a rotated set partitioning strategy that alternates between two partitioning configurations in consecutive self-attention layers. To support effective downsampling and better encode geometric information, we also propose an attention-style 3D pooling module on sparse points, which is powerful and deployment-friendly without utilizing any customized CUDA operations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale Waymo Open Dataset with remarkable gains. More importantly, DSVT can be easily deployed by TensorRT with real-time inference speed (27Hz).

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this work, we investigate a simple and must-known conditional generative framework based on Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) for human motion generation from textural descriptions. We show that a simple CNN-based VQ-VAE with commonly used training recipes (EMA and Code Reset) allows us to obtain high-quality discrete representations. For GPT, we incorporate a simple corruption strategy during the training to alleviate training-testing discrepancy. Despite its simplicity, our T2M-GPT shows better performance than competitive approaches, including recent diffusion-based approaches. For example, on HumanML3D, which is currently the largest dataset, we achieve comparable performance on the consistency between text and generated motion (R-Precision), but with FID 0.116 largely outperforming MotionDiffuse of 0.630. Additionally, we conduct analyses on HumanML3D and observe that the dataset size is a limitation of our approach. Our work suggests that VQ-VAE still remains a competitive approach for human motion generation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: BERT-based re-ranking and dense retrieval (DR) systems have been shown to improve search effectiveness for spoken content retrieval (SCR). However, both methods can still show a reduction in effectiveness when using ASR transcripts in comparison to accurate manual transcripts. We find that a known-item search task on the How2 dataset of spoken instruction videos shows a reduction in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores of 10-14%. As a potential method to reduce this disparity, we investigate the use of semi-supervised ASR transcripts and N-best ASR transcripts to mitigate ASR errors for spoken search using BERT-based ranking. Semi-supervised ASR transcripts brought 2-5.5% MRR improvements over standard ASR transcripts and our N-best early fusion methods for BERT DR systems improved MRR by 3-4%. Combining semi-supervised transcripts with N-best early fusion for BERT DR reduced the MRR gap in search effectiveness between manual and ASR transcripts by more than 50% from 14.32% to 6.58%. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: There are a plethora of methods and algorithms that solve the classical multi-label document classification. However, when it comes to deployment and usage in an industry setting, most, if not all the contemporary approaches fail to address some of the vital aspects or requirements of an ideal solution: i. ability to operate on variable-length texts and rambling documents. ii. catastrophic forgetting problem. iii. modularity when it comes to online learning and updating the model. iv. ability to spotlight relevant text while producing the prediction, i.e. visualizing the predictions. v. ability to operate on imbalanced or skewed datasets. vi. scalability. The paper describes the significance of these problems in detail and proposes a unique neural network architecture that addresses the above problems. The proposed architecture views documents as a sequence of sentences and leverages sentence-level embeddings for input representation. A hydranet-like architecture is designed to have granular control over and improve the modularity, coupled with a weighted loss driving task-specific heads. In particular, two specific mechanisms are compared: Bi-LSTM and Transformer-based. The architecture is benchmarked on some of the popular benchmarking datasets such as Web of Science - 5763, Web of Science - 11967, BBC Sports, and BBC News datasets. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods by a substantial margin. The ablation study includes comparisons of the impact of the attention mechanism and the application of weighted loss functions to train the task-specific heads in the hydranet. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: There are many problems in physics, biology, and other natural sciences in which symbolic regression can provide valuable insights and discover new laws of nature. A widespread Deep Neural Networks do not provide interpretable solutions. Meanwhile, symbolic expressions give us a clear relation between observations and the target variable. However, at the moment, there is no dominant solution for the symbolic regression task, and we aim to reduce this gap with our algorithm. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework for symbolic expression generation via variational autoencoder (VAE). In a nutshell, we suggest using a VAE to generate mathematical expressions, and our training strategy forces generated formulas to fit a given dataset. Our framework allows encoding apriori knowledge of the formulas into fast-check predicates that speed up the optimization process. We compare our method to modern symbolic regression benchmarks and show that our method outperforms the competitors under noisy conditions. The recovery rate of SEGVAE is 65% on the Ngyuen dataset with a noise level of 10%, which is better than the previously reported SOTA by 20%. We demonstrate that this value depends on the dataset and can be even higher. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We develop a novel cut discontinuous Galerkin (CutDG) method for stationary advection-reaction problems on surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The CutDG method is based on embedding the surface into a full-dimensional background mesh and using the associated discontinuous piecewise polynomials of order $k$ as test and trial functions. As the surface can cut through the mesh in an arbitrary fashion, we design a suitable stabilization that enables us to establish inf-sup stability, a priori error estimates, and condition number estimates using an augmented streamline-diffusion norm. The resulting CutDG formulation is geometrically robust in the sense that all derived theoretical results hold with constants independent of any particular cut configuration. Numerical examples support our theoretical findings. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: This paper proposes a unified gas-kinetic particle (UGKP) method for the frequency-dependent photon transport process. The photon transport is a typical multiscale process governed by the nonlinear radiative transfer equations (RTE). The flow regime of photon transport varies from the ballistic regime to the diffusive regime with respect to optical depth and photon frequency. The UGKP method is an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme and a regime adaptive scheme. The teleportation error is significantly reduced, and the computational efficiency is remarkably improved in the diffusive regime. Distinguished from the standard multigroup treatment, the proposed UGKP method solves the frequency space in a non-discretized way. Therefore the Rosseland diffusion system can be precisely preserved in the optically thick regime. Taking advantage of the local integral solution of RTE, the distribution of the emitted photon can be constructed from its macroscopic moments. The Monte Carlo particles in the UGKP method need only be tracked before their first collision events, and a re-sampling process is performed to close the photon distribution for each time step. The large computational cost of excessive scattering events can be saved, especially in the optically thick regime. The proposed UGKP method is implicit and removes the light speed constraint on the time step. The particle tracking approach combining the implicit formulation makes the proposed UGKP method an efficient solution algorithm for frequency-dependent radiative transfer problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples the capability of the proposed multi-frequency UGKP method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

The proposed method utilizes a generator, global discriminator, and local discriminator to inpaint the missing regions of the image. The generator is based on an auto-encoder architecture with skip-connections, and the loss function used is the Wasserstein GAN loss. Our experiments on a dataset of borehole images demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively deal with large-scale missing pixels and generate realistic completion results. This approach can improve the quantitative evaluation of reservoirs and provide an essential basis for interpreting geological phenomena and reservoir parameters. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Building segmentation from aerial images and 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) is a challenging task due to the diversity of backgrounds, building textures, and image quality. While current research using different types of convolutional and transformer networks has considerably improved the performance on this task, even more accurate segmentation methods for buildings are desirable for applications such as automatic mapping. In this study, we propose a general framework termed \emph{BuildSeg} employing a generic approach that can be quickly applied to segment buildings. Different data sources were combined to increase generalization performance. The approach yields good results for different data sources as shown by experiments on high-resolution multi-spectral and LiDAR imagery of cities in Norway, Denmark and France. We applied ConvNeXt and SegFormer based models on the high resolution aerial image dataset from the MapAI-competition. The methods achieved an IOU of 0.7902 and a boundary IOU of 0.6185. We used post-processing to account for the rectangular shape of the objects. This increased the boundary IOU from 0.6185 to 0.6189. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

When the external stimuli is highly dynamic, it becomes hard to model the effect that how the stimuli influences human cognition behaviors. Here we propose a novel hybrid deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework integrating drift-diffusion model to simulate the effect of dynamic time pressure on human cognition performance. We start with a N=50 user study to investigate how different factors may affect human performance, which help us gain prior knowledge in framework design. The evaluation demonstrates that this framework could improve human cognition modeling quantitatively and capture the general trend of human cognition behaviors qualitatively. Our framework could also be extended to explore and simulate how different external factors play a role in human behaviors. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The ability to quickly learn a new task with minimal instruction - known as few-shot learning - is a central aspect of intelligent agents. Classical few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently. In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better ${\bf visual}$ dog classifier by ${\bf read}$ing about dogs and ${\bf listen}$ing to them bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models such as CLIP are inherently cross-modal, mapping different modalities to the same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple cross-modal adaptation approach that learns from few-shot examples spanning different modalities. By repurposing class names as additional one-shot training samples, we achieve SOTA results with an embarrassingly simple linear classifier for vision-language adaptation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can benefit existing methods such as prefix tuning, adapters, and classifier ensembling. Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We first adopt a human-guided machine learning framework to develop a new dataset for hyperpartisan news title detection with 2,200 manually labeled and 1.8 million machine-labeled titles that were posted from 2014 to the present by nine representative media organizations across three media bias groups - Left, Central, and Right in an active learning manner. The fine-tuned transformer-based language model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.84 and an F1 score of 0.78 on an external validation set. Next, we conduct a computational analysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles. While some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced differences between the three media groups. We find that overall the Right media tends to use proportionally more hyperpartisan titles. Roughly around the 2016 Presidential Election, the proportions of hyperpartisan titles increased in all media bias groups where the relative increase in the proportion of hyperpartisan titles of the Left media was the most. We identify three major topics including foreign issues, political systems, and societal issues that are suggestive of hyperpartisanship in news titles using logistic regression models and the Shapley values. Through an analysis of the topic distribution, we find that societal issues gradually receive more attention from all media groups. We further apply a lexicon-based language analysis tool to the titles of each topic and quantify the linguistic distance between any pairs of the three media groups. Three distinct patterns are discovered. The Left media is linguistically more different from Central and Right in terms of foreign issues. The linguistic distance between the three media groups becomes smaller over recent years. In addition, a seasonal pattern where linguistic difference is associated with elections is observed for societal issues. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is a recently proposed training method that seeks to find flat minima in deep learning, resulting in state-of-the-art performance across various domains. Instead of minimizing the loss of the current weights, SAM minimizes the worst-case loss in its neighborhood in the parameter space. In this paper, we demonstrate that SAM dynamics can have convergence instability that occurs near a saddle point. Utilizing the qualitative theory of dynamical systems, we explain how SAM becomes stuck in the saddle point and then theoretically prove that the saddle point can become an attractor under SAM dynamics. Additionally, we show that this convergence instability can also occur in stochastic dynamical systems by establishing the diffusion of SAM. We prove that SAM diffusion is worse than that of vanilla gradient descent in terms of saddle point escape. Further, we demonstrate that often overlooked training tricks, momentum and batch-size, are important to mitigate the convergence instability and achieve high generalization performance. Our theoretical and empirical results are thoroughly verified through experiments on several well-known optimization problems and benchmark tasks. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With the explosive growth of web videos and emerging large-scale vision-language pre-training models, e.g., CLIP, retrieving videos of interest with text instructions has attracted increasing attention. A common practice is to transfer text-video pairs to the same embedding space and craft cross-modal interactions with certain entities in specific granularities for semantic correspondence. Unfortunately, the intrinsic uncertainties of optimal entity combinations in appropriate granularities for cross-modal queries are understudied, which is especially critical for modalities with hierarchical semantics, e.g., video, text, etc. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-Adaptive Text-Video Retrieval approach, termed UATVR, which models each look-up as a distribution matching procedure. Concretely, we add additional learnable tokens in the encoders to adaptively aggregate multi-grained semantics for flexible high-level reasoning. In the refined embedding space, we represent text-video pairs as probabilistic distributions where prototypes are sampled for matching evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks justify the superiority of our UATVR, which achieves new state-of-the-art results on MSR-VTT (50.8%), VATEX (64.5%), MSVD (49.7%), and DiDeMo (45.8%). The code is available in supplementary materials and will be released publicly soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Although existing neural network approaches have achieved great success on Chinese spelling correction, there is still room to improve. The model is required to avoid over-correction and to distinguish a correct token from its phonological and visually similar ones. In this paper, we propose an error-guided correction model (EGCM) to improve Chinese spelling correction. By borrowing the powerful ability of BERT, we propose a novel zero-shot error detection method to do a preliminary detection, which guides our model to attend more on the probably wrong tokens in encoding and to avoid modifying the correct tokens in generating. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function to integrate the error confusion set, which enables our model to distinguish easily misused tokens. Moreover, our model supports highly parallel decoding to meet real application requirements. Experiments are conducted on widely used benchmarks. Our model achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art approaches by a remarkable margin, on both the correction quality and computation speed. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Traditional tabular classifiers provide explainable decision-making with interpretable features(concepts). However, using their explainability in vision tasks has been limited due to the pixel representation of images. In this paper, we design Img2Tabs that classify images by concepts to harness the explainability of tabular classifiers. Img2Tabs encode image pixels into tabular features by StyleGAN inversion. Since not all of the resulting features are class-relevant or interpretable due to their generative nature, we expect Img2Tab classifiers to discover class-relevant concepts automatically from the StyleGAN features. Thus, we propose a novel method using the Wasserstein-1 metric to quantify class-relevancy and interpretability simultaneously. Using this method, we investigate whether important features extracted by tabular classifiers are class-relevant concepts. Consequently, we determine the most effective classifier for Img2Tabs in terms of discovering class-relevant concepts automatically from StyleGAN features. In evaluations, we demonstrate concept-based explanations through importance and visualization. Img2Tab achieves top-1 accuracy that is on par with CNN classifiers and deep feature learning baselines. Additionally, we show that users can easily debug Img2Tab classifiers at the concept level to ensure unbiased and fair decision-making without sacrificing accuracy. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose \emph{neighborhood-based core decomposition}: a novel way of decomposing hypergraphs into hierarchical neighborhood-cohesive subhypergraphs. Alternative approaches to decomposing hypergraphs, e.g., reduction to clique or bipartite graphs, are not meaningful in certain applications, the later also results in inefficient decomposition; while existing degree-based hypergraph decomposition does not distinguish nodes with different neighborhood sizes. Our case studies show that the proposed decomposition is more effective than degree and clique graph-based decompositions in disease intervention and in extracting provably approximate and application-wise meaningful densest subhypergraphs. We propose three algorithms: \textbf{Peel}, its efficient variant \textbf{E-Peel}, and a novel local algorithm: \textbf{Local-core} with parallel implementation. Our most efficient parallel algorithm \textbf{Local-core(P)} decomposes hypergraph with 27M nodes and 17M hyperedges in-memory within 91 seconds by adopting various optimizations. Finally, we develop a new hypergraph-core model, the (neighborhood, degree)-core} by considering both neighborhood and degree constraints, design its decomposition algorithm \textbf{Local-core+Peel}, and demonstrate its superiority in spreading diffusion. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Synthetic data generation is increasingly important due to privacy concerns. While Autoencoder-based approaches have been widely used for this purpose, sampling from their latent spaces can be challenging. Mixture models are currently the most efficient way to sample from these spaces. In this work, we propose a new approach that models the latent space of an Autoencoder as a simplex, allowing for a novel heuristic for determining the number of components in the mixture model. This heuristic is independent of the number of classes and produces comparable results. We also introduce a sampling method based on probability mass functions, taking advantage of the compactness of the latent space. We evaluate our approaches on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate their performance on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Celeba. Our approach achieves an image generation FID of 4.29, 13.55, and 11.90 on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Celeba datasets, respectively. The best AE FID results to date on those datasets are respectively 6.3, 85.3 and 35.6 we hence substantially improve those figures (the lower is the FID the better). However, AEs are not the best performing algorithms on the concerned datasets and all FID records are currently held by GANs. While we do not perform better than GANs on CIFAR and Celeba we do manage to squeeze-out a non-negligible improvement (of 0.21) over the current GAN-held record for the MNIST dataset. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose a novel family of asymptotically stable, implicit-explicit, adaptive, time integration method (denoted with the $\theta$-method) for the solution of the fractional advection-diffusion-reaction (FADR) equations. This family of time integration method generalized the computationally explicit $L_1$-method adopted by Brunner (J. Comput. Phys. {\bf 229} 6613-6622 (2010)) as well as the fully implicit method proposed by Jannelli (Comm. Nonlin. Sci. Num. Sim., {\bf 105}, 106073 (2022)). The spectral analysis of the method (involving the group velocity and the phase speed) indicates a region of favorable dispersion for a limited range of Peclet number. The numerical inversion of the coefficient matrix is avoided by exploiting the sparse structure of the matrix in the iterative solver for the Poisson equation. The accuracy and the efficacy of the method is benchmarked using (a) the two-dimensional (2D) fractional diffusion equation, originally proposed by Brunner, and (b) the incompressible, subdiffusive dynamics of a planar viscoelastic channel flow of the Rouse chain melts (FADR equation with fractional time-derivative of order $\alpha=\nicefrac{1}{2}$) and the Zimm chain solution ($\alpha=\nicefrac{2}{3}$). Numerical simulations of the viscoelastic channel flow effectively capture the non-homogeneous regions of high viscosity at low fluid inertia (or the so-called `spatiotemporal macrostructures'), experimentally observed in the flow-instability transition of subdiffusive flows. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We propose causal recurrent variational autoencoder (CR-VAE), a novel generative model that is able to learn a Granger causal graph from a multivariate time series x and incorporates the underlying causal mechanism into its data generation process. Distinct to the classical recurrent VAEs, our CR-VAE uses a multi-head decoder, in which the $p$-th head is responsible for generating the $p$-th dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ (i.e., $\mathbf{x}^p$). By imposing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weights (of the decoder) and encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero, our CR-VAE learns a sparse adjacency matrix that encodes causal relations between all pairs of variables. Thanks to this causal matrix, our decoder strictly obeys the underlying principles of Granger causality, thereby making the data generating process transparent. We develop a two-stage approach to train the overall objective. Empirically, we evaluate the behavior of our model in synthetic data and two real-world human brain datasets involving, respectively, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time series generative models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, it also discovers a faithful causal graph with similar or improved accuracy over existing Granger causality-based causal inference methods.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Time series probabilistic forecasting with multi-dimensional and sporadic data (known as sparse data) has potential to implement monitoring kinds of physiological indices of patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In this paper, we propose Transformer-based Diffusion probabilistic model for Sparse Time series Forecasting (TDSTF), a new model to predict distribution of highly sparse time series. There are many works that focus on probabilistic forecasting, but few of them avoid noise that come from extreme sparsity of data. We take advantage of Triplet, a data organization that represents sparse time series in a much efficient way, for our model to bypass data redundancy in the traditional matrix form. The proposed model performed better on MIMIC-III ICU dataset than the current state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models. We obtained normalized average continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) of $\mathbf{0.4379}$, and mean squared error (MSE) of $\mathbf{0.4008}$ when adopting the median of the model samplings as the deterministic forecasting.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: A common assumption in deep learning-based multivariate and multistep traffic time series forecasting models is that residuals are independent, isotropic, and uncorrelated in space and time. While this assumption provides a straightforward loss function (such as MAE/MSE), it is inevitable that residual processes will exhibit strong autocorrelation and structured spatiotemporal correlation. In this paper, we propose a complementary dynamic regression (DR) framework to enhance existing deep multistep traffic forecasting frameworks through structured specifications and learning for the residual process. Specifically, we assume the residuals of the base model (i.e., a well-developed traffic forecasting model) are governed by a matrix-variate seasonal autoregressive (AR) model, which can be seamlessly integrated into the training process by redesigning the overall loss function. Parameters in the DR framework can be jointly learned with the base model. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing several state-of-the-art deep traffic forecasting models on both speed and flow datasets. Our experiment results show that the DR framework not only improves existing traffic forecasting models but also offers interpretable regression coefficients and spatiotemporal covariance matrices. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Sentiment detection in software engineering (SE) has shown promise to support diverse development activities. However, given the diversity of SE platforms, SE-specific sentiment detection tools may suffer in performance in cross-platform settings. Recently deep learning (DL)-based SE-specific sentiment detection tools are found to offer superior performance than shallow machine learning (ML) based/rule-based tools. However, it is not known how the DL tools perform in cross-platform settings. In this paper, we study whether SE-specific DL sentiment detectors are more effective than shallow ML-based/rule-based sentiment detectors in cross-platform settings. In three datasets, we study three DL tools (SEntiMoji, BERT4SEntiSE, RNN4SentiSE) and compare those against three baselines: two shallow learning tools (Senti4SD, SentiCR) and one rule-based tool (SentistrengthSE). We find that (1) The deep learning SD tools for SE, BERT4SentiSE outperform other supervised tools in cross-platform settings in most cases, but then the tool is outperformed by the rule-based tool SentistrengthSE in most cases. (2) BERT4SentiSE outperforms SentistrengthSE by large margin in within-platform settings across the three datasets and is only narrowly outperformed by SentiStrengthSE in four out of the six cross-platform settings. This finding offers hope for the feasibility to further improve a pre-trained transformer model like BERT4SentiSE in cross-platform settings. (3) The two best-performing deep learning tools (BERT4SentiSE and SentiMoji) show varying level performance drop across the three datasets. We find that this inconsistency is mainly due to the "subjectivity in annotation" and performance improvement for the studied supervised tools in cross-platform settings may require the fixing of the datasets. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: People may perform diverse gestures affected by various mental and physical factors when speaking the same sentences. This inherent one-to-many relationship makes co-speech gesture generation from audio particularly challenging. Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of all possible target motions, easily resulting in plain/boring motions during inference. So we propose to explicitly model the one-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code is expected to be responsible for the motion component that is more correlated to the audio while the motion-specific code is expected to capture diverse motion information that is more independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts poses extra training difficulties. Several crucial training losses/strategies, including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and diversity loss, are designed to better train the VAE. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: With modern computational advancements and statistical analysis methods, machine learning algorithms have become a vital part of engineering modeling. Neural Operator Networks (ONets) is an emerging machine learning algorithm as a "faster surrogate" for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their ability to approximate mathematical operators versus the direct approximation of Neural Networks (NN). ONets use the Universal Approximation Theorem to map finite-dimensional inputs to infinite-dimensional space using the branch-trunk architecture, which encodes domain and feature information separately before using a dot product to combine the information. ONets are expected to occupy a vital niche for surrogate modeling in physical systems and Digital Twin (DT) development. Three test cases are evaluated using ONets for operator approximation, including a 1-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODE), general diffusion system, and convection-diffusion (Burger) system. Solutions for ODE and diffusion systems yield accurate and reliable results (R2&gt;0.95), while solutions for Burger systems need further refinement in the ONet algorithm. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Monocular depth estimation plays a critical role in various computer vision and robotics applications such as localization, mapping, and 3D object detection. Recently, learning-based algorithms achieve huge success in depth estimation by training models with a large amount of data in a supervised manner. However, it is challenging to acquire dense ground truth depth labels for supervised training, and the unsupervised depth estimation using monocular sequences emerges as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, most studies on unsupervised depth estimation explore loss functions or occlusion masks, and there is little change in model architecture in that ConvNet-based encoder-decoder structure becomes a de-facto standard for depth estimation. In this paper, we employ a convolution-free Swin Transformer as an image feature extractor so that the network can capture both local geometric features and global semantic features for depth estimation. Also, we propose a Densely Cascaded Multi-scale Network (DCMNet) that connects every feature map directly with another from different scales via a top-down cascade pathway. This densely cascaded connectivity reinforces the interconnection between decoding layers and produces high-quality multi-scale depth outputs. The experiments on two different datasets, KITTI and Make3D, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Previous works on emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) follow a two-step paradigm, which can be summarized as first producing context-independent features via fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) and then analyzing contextual information and dialogue structure information among the extracted features. However, we discover that this paradigm has several limitations. Accordingly, we propose a novel paradigm, i.e., exploring contextual information and dialogue structure information in the fine-tuning step, and adapting the PLM to the ERC task in terms of input text, classification structure, and training strategy. Furthermore, we develop our model BERT-ERC according to the proposed paradigm, which improves ERC performance in three aspects, namely suggestive text, fine-grained classification module, and two-stage training. Compared to existing methods, BERT-ERC achieves substantial improvement on four datasets, indicating its effectiveness and generalization capability. Besides, we also set up the limited resources scenario and the online prediction scenario to approximate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm significantly outperforms the previous one and can be adapted to various scenes. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: How language models process complex input that requires multiple steps of inference is not well understood. Previous research has shown that information about intermediate values of these inputs can be extracted from the activations of the models, but it is unclear where that information is encoded and whether that information is indeed used during inference. We introduce a method for analyzing how a Transformer model processes these inputs by focusing on simple arithmetic problems and their intermediate values. To trace where information about intermediate values is encoded, we measure the correlation between intermediate values and the activations of the model using principal component analysis (PCA). Then, we perform a causal intervention by manipulating model weights. This intervention shows that the weights identified via tracing are not merely correlated with intermediate values, but causally related to model predictions. Our findings show that the model has a locality to certain intermediate values, and this is useful for enhancing the interpretability of the models. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Automatic term extraction (ATE) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that eases the effort of manually identifying terms from domain-specific corpora by providing a list of candidate terms. As units of knowledge in a specific field of expertise, extracted terms are not only beneficial for several terminographical tasks, but also support and improve several complex downstream tasks, e.g., information retrieval, machine translation, topic detection, and sentiment analysis. ATE systems, along with annotated datasets, have been studied and developed widely for decades, but recently we observed a surge in novel neural systems for the task at hand. Despite a large amount of new research on ATE, systematic survey studies covering novel neural approaches are lacking. We present a comprehensive survey of deep learning-based approaches to ATE, with a focus on Transformer-based neural models. The study also offers a comparison between these systems and previous ATE approaches, which were based on feature engineering and non-neural supervised learning algorithms. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has achieved impressive results in single object scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, which have been demonstrated on many single modality and single object focused indoor scene datasets like DTU, BMVS, and NeRF Synthetic.However, the study of NeRF on large-scale outdoor scene reconstruction is still limited, as there is no unified outdoor scene dataset for large-scale NeRF evaluation due to expensive data acquisition and calibration costs. In this paper, we propose a large-scale outdoor multi-modal dataset, OMMO dataset, containing complex land objects and scenes with calibrated images, point clouds and prompt annotations. Meanwhile, a new benchmark for several outdoor NeRF-based tasks is established, such as novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, and multi-modal NeRF. To create the dataset, we capture and collect a large number of real fly-view videos and select high-quality and high-resolution clips from them. Then we design a quality review module to refine images, remove low-quality frames and fail-to-calibrate scenes through a learning-based automatic evaluation plus manual review. Finally, a number of volunteers are employed to add the text descriptions for each scene and key-frame to meet the potential multi-modal requirements in the future. Compared with existing NeRF datasets, our dataset contains abundant real-world urban and natural scenes with various scales, camera trajectories, and lighting conditions. Experiments show that our dataset can benchmark most state-of-the-art NeRF methods on different tasks. We will release the dataset and model weights very soon. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Recent advances in deep learning base on growing model sizes and the necessary scaling of compute power. Training such large-scale models requires an intricate combination of data-, operator-, and pipeline parallelism in complex distributed systems. We show how to use OneFlow's Split, Broadcast, and Partial Sum (SBP) tensor formulations to enable new distributed training methods with asymptotically optimal communication overheads. Using these insights, we develop AutoDDL, a distributed training framework that combines an exhaustive performance model and automated configuration search to find distributions with near-optimal communication overheads. We conduct evaluations on Multi-Node-Single-GPU and Multi-Node-Multi-GPU machines using different models, including VGG and Transformer. Compared to expert-optimized implementations, AutoDDL reduces the end-to-end training time by up to 31.1\% and 10\% for Transformer and up to 17.7\% and 71.5\% for VGG on the two different systems, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We introduce a new Eulerian simulation framework for liquid animation that leverages both finite element and finite volume methods. In contrast to previous methods where the whole simulation domain is discretized either using the finite volume method or finite element method, our method spatially merges them together using two types of discretization being tightly coupled on its seams while enforcing second order accurate boundary conditions at free surfaces. We achieve our formulation via a variational form using new shape functions specifically designed for this purpose. By enabling a mixture of the two methods, we can take advantage of the best of two worlds. For example, finite volume method (FVM) result in sparse linear systems; however, complexity is encountered when unstructured grids such as tetrahedral or Voronoi elements are used. Finite element method (FEM), on the other hand, result in comparably denser linear systems, but the complexity remains the same even if unstructured elements are chosen; thereby facilitating spatial adaptivity. In this paper, we propose to use FVM for the majority parts to retain the sparsity of linear systems and FEM for parts where the grid elements are allowed to be freely deformed. An example of this application is locally moving grids. We show that by adapting the local grid movement to an underlying nearly rigid motion, numerical diffusion is noticeably reduced; leading to better preservation of structural details such as sharp edges, thin sheets and spindles of liquids. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: As a fundamental and challenging task in bridging language and vision domains, Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) aims at searching for the target instances that are semantically relevant to the given query from the other modality, and its key challenge is to measure the semantic similarity across different modalities. Although significant progress has been achieved, existing approaches typically suffer from two major limitations: (1) It hurts the accuracy of the representation by directly exploiting the bottom-up attention based region-level features where each region is equally treated. (2) It limits the scale of negative sample pairs by employing the mini-batch based end-to-end training mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Semantic Enhancement Momentum Contrastive Learning (USER) method for ITR. Specifically, we delicately design two simple but effective Global representation based Semantic Enhancement (GSE) modules. One learns the global representation via the self-attention algorithm, noted as Self-Guided Enhancement (SGE) module. The other module benefits from the pre-trained CLIP module, which provides a novel scheme to exploit and transfer the knowledge from an off-the-shelf model, noted as CLIP-Guided Enhancement (CGE) module. Moreover, we incorporate the training mechanism of MoCo into ITR, in which two dynamic queues are employed to enrich and enlarge the scale of negative sample pairs. Meanwhile, a Unified Training Objective (UTO) is developed to learn from mini-batch based and dynamic queue based samples. Extensive experiments on the benchmark MSCOCO and Flickr30K datasets demonstrate the superiority of both retrieval accuracy and inference efficiency.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: State-of-the-art solutions for Shape-from-Polarization (SfP) suffer from a speed-resolution tradeoff: they either sacrifice the number of polarization angles measured or necessitate lengthy acquisition times due to framerate constraints, thus compromising either accuracy or latency. We tackle this tradeoff using event cameras. Event cameras operate at microseconds resolution with negligible motion blur, and output a continuous stream of events that precisely measures how light changes over time asynchronously. We propose a setup that consists of a linear polarizer rotating at high-speeds in front of an event camera. Our method uses the continuous event stream caused by the rotation to reconstruct relative intensities at multiple polarizer angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms physics-based baselines using frames, reducing the MAE by 25% in synthetic and real-world dataset. In the real world, we observe, however, that the challenging conditions (i.e., when few events are generated) harm the performance of physics-based solutions. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based approach that learns to estimate surface normals even at low event-rates, improving the physics-based approach by 52% on the real world dataset. The proposed system achieves an acquisition speed equivalent to 50 fps (&gt;twice the framerate of the commercial polarization sensor) while retaining the spatial resolution of 1MP. Our evaluation is based on the first large-scale dataset for event-based SfP <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Transformer models have achieved promising performances in point cloud segmentation. However, most existing attention schemes provide the same feature learning paradigm for all points equally and overlook the enormous difference in size among scene objects. In this paper, we propose the Size-Aware Transformer (SAT) that can tailor effective receptive fields for objects of different sizes. Our SAT achieves size-aware learning via two steps: introduce multi-scale features to each attention layer and allow each point to choose its attentive fields adaptively. It contains two key designs: the Multi-Granularity Attention (MGA) scheme and the Re-Attention module. The MGA addresses two challenges: efficiently aggregating tokens from distant areas and preserving multi-scale features within one attention layer. Specifically, point-voxel cross attention is proposed to address the first challenge, and the shunted strategy based on the standard multi-head self attention is applied to solve the second. The Re-Attention module dynamically adjusts the attention scores to the fine- and coarse-grained features output by MGA for each point. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAT achieves state-of-the-art performances on S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets. Our SAT also achieves the most balanced performance on categories among all referred methods, which illustrates the superiority of modelling categories of different sizes. Our code and model will be released after the acceptance of this paper. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Neural Networks are infamously sensitive to small perturbations in their inputs, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This project evaluates the performance of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) as a purification technique to defend against adversarial attacks. This works by adding noise to an adversarial example before removing it through the reverse process of the diffusion model. We evaluate the approach on the PatchCamelyon data set for histopathologic scans of lymph node sections and find an improvement of the robust accuracy by up to 88\% of the original model's accuracy, constituting a considerable improvement over the vanilla model and our baselines.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Traditional segmentation methods for colonic polyps are mainly designed based on low-level features. They could not accurately extract the location of small colonic polyps. Although the existing deep learning methods can improve the segmentation accuracy, their effects are still unsatisfied. To meet the above challenges, we propose a hybrid network called Fusion-Transformer-HardNetMSEG (i.e., Fu-TransHNet) in this study. Fu-TransHNet uses deep learning of different mechanisms to fuse each other and is enhanced with multi-view collaborative learning techniques. Firstly, the Fu-TransHNet utilizes the Transformer branch and the CNN branch to realize the global feature learning and local feature learning, respectively. Secondly, a fusion module is designed to integrate the features from two branches. The fusion module consists of two parts: 1) the Global-Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) part and 2) the Dense Fusion of Multi-scale features (DFM) part. The former is built to compensate the feature information mission from two branches at the same scale; the latter is constructed to enhance the feature representation. Thirdly, the above two branches and fusion modules utilize multi-view cooperative learning techniques to obtain their respective weights that denote their importance and then make a final decision comprehensively. Experimental results showed that the Fu-TransHNet network was superior to the existing methods on five widely used benchmark datasets. In particular, on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB dataset containing many small-target colonic polyps, the mDice obtained by Fu-TransHNet were 12.4% and 6.2% higher than the state-of-the-art methods HardNet-MSEG and TransFuse-s, respectively. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Speech patterns have been identified as potential diagnostic markers for neuropsychiatric conditions. However, most studies only compare a single clinical group to healthy controls, whereas clinical practice often requires differentiating between multiple potential diagnoses (multiclass settings). To address this, we assembled a dataset of repeated recordings from 420 participants (67 with major depressive disorder, 106 with schizophrenia and 46 with autism, as well as matched controls), and tested the performance of a range of conventional machine learning models and advanced Transformer models on both binary and multiclass classification, based on voice and text features. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Both masked image modeling (MIM) and natural language supervision have facilitated the progress of transferable visual pre-training. In this work, we seek the synergy between two paradigms and study the emerging properties when MIM meets natural language supervision. To this end, we present a novel masked visual Reconstruction In Language semantic Space (RILS) pre-training framework, in which sentence representations, encoded by the text encoder, serve as prototypes to transform the vision-only signals into patch-sentence probabilities as semantically meaningful MIM reconstruction targets. The vision models can therefore capture useful components with structured information by predicting proper semantic of masked tokens. Better visual representations could, in turn, improve the text encoder via the image-text alignment objective, which is essential for the effective MIM target transformation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method not only enjoys the best of previous MIM and CLIP but also achieves further improvements on various tasks due to their mutual benefits. RILS exhibits advanced transferability on downstream classification, detection, and segmentation, especially for low-shot regimes.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Document Summarization is the procedure of generating a meaningful and concise summary of a given document with the inclusion of relevant and topic-important points. There are two approaches: one is picking up the most relevant statements from the document itself and adding it to the Summary known as Extractive and the other is generating sentences for the Summary known as Abstractive Summarization. Training a machine learning model to perform tasks that are time-consuming or very difficult for humans to evaluate is a major challenge. Book Abstract generation is one of such complex tasks. Traditional machine learning models are getting modified with pre-trained transformers. Transformer based language models trained in a self-supervised fashion are gaining a lot of attention; when fine-tuned for Natural Language Processing(NLP) downstream task like text summarization. This work is an attempt to use Transformer based techniques for Abstract generation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. This implicit training is in contrast to explicitly tuning the model weights based on examples. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem, treating the transformer model as a learning algorithm that can be specialized via training to implement-at inference-time-another target algorithm. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer, which holds under mild assumptions. Secondly, we use our abstraction to show that transformers can act as an adaptive learning algorithm and perform model selection across different hypothesis classes. We provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) identify an inductive bias phenomenon where the transfer risk on unseen tasks is independent of the transformer complexity, and (3) empirically verify our theoretical predictions. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Most recent self-supervised learning~(SSL) methods are pre-trained on the well-curated ImageNet-1K dataset. In this work, we consider SSL pre-training on noisy web image-text paired data due to the excellent scalability of web data. First, we conduct a benchmark study of representative SSL pre-training methods on large-scale web data in a fair condition. Methods include single-modal ones such as MAE and multi-modal ones such as CLIP. We observe that multi-modal methods cannot outperform single-modal ones on vision transfer learning tasks. We derive an information-theoretical view to explain the benchmarking results, which provides insights into designing novel vision learners. Inspired by the above explorations, we present a visual representation pre-training method, MUlti-modal Generator~(MUG), for scalable web image-text data. MUG achieves state-of-the-art transferring performances on a variety of tasks and shows promising scaling behavior. Models and codes will be made public.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have made amazing advances. However, the status quo is to use text input alone, which can impede controllability. In this work, we propose GLIGEN, Grounded-Language-to-Image Generation, a novel approach that builds upon and extends the functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by enabling them to also be conditioned on grounding inputs. To preserve the vast concept knowledge of the pre-trained model, we freeze all of its weights and inject the grounding information into new trainable layers via a gated mechanism. Our model achieves open-world grounded text2img generation with caption and bounding box condition inputs, and the grounding ability generalizes well to novel spatial configuration and concepts. GLIGEN's zero-shot performance on COCO and LVIS outperforms that of existing supervised layout-to-image baselines by a large margin. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Image-text contrastive learning models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong task transfer ability. The high generality and usability of these visual models is achieved via a web-scale data collection process to ensure broad concept coverage, followed by expensive pre-training to feed all the knowledge into model weights. Alternatively, we propose REACT, REtrieval-Augmented CusTomization, a framework to acquire the relevant web knowledge to build customized visual models for target domains. We retrieve the most relevant image-text pairs (~3% of CLIP pre-training data) from the web-scale database as external knowledge, and propose to customize the model by only training new modualized blocks while freezing all the original weights. The effectiveness of REACT is demonstrated via extensive experiments on classification, retrieval, detection and segmentation tasks, including zero, few, and full-shot settings. Particularly, on the zero-shot classification task, compared with CLIP, it achieves up to 5.4% improvement on ImageNet and 3.7% on the ELEVATER benchmark (20 datasets). <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Bayesian inverse problems are often computationally challenging when the forward model is governed by complex partial differential equations (PDEs). This is typically caused by expensive forward model evaluations and high-dimensional parameterization of priors. This paper proposes a domain-decomposed variational auto-encoder Markov chain Monte Carlo (DD-VAE-MCMC) method to tackle these challenges simultaneously. Through partitioning the global physical domain into small subdomains, the proposed method first constructs local deterministic generative models based on local historical data, which provide efficient local prior representations. Gaussian process models with active learning address the domain decomposition interface conditions. Then inversions are conducted on each subdomain independently in parallel and in low-dimensional latent parameter spaces. The local inference solutions are post-processed through the Poisson image blending procedure to result in an efficient global inference result. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have wide applications in superconductors, quantum, and topological materials. However, their rational design is not well established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions, which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction. Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including NiCl$_4$, IrSBr, CuBr$_3$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D materials and other functional materials. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: In this paper, we consider solving the distributed optimization problem over a multi-agent network under the communication restricted setting. We study a compressed decentralized stochastic gradient method, termed ``compressed exact diffusion with adaptive stepsizes (CEDAS)", and show the method asymptotically achieves comparable convergence rate as centralized SGD for both smooth strongly convex objective functions and smooth nonconvex objective functions under unbiased compression operators. In particular, to our knowledge, CEDAS enjoys so far the shortest transient time (with respect to the graph specifics) for achieving the convergence rate of centralized SGD, which behaves as $\mathcal{O}(nC^3/(1-\lambda_2)^{2})$ under smooth strongly convex objective functions, and $\mathcal{O}(n^3C^6/(1-\lambda_2)^4)$ under smooth nonconvex objective functions, where $(1-\lambda_2)$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix, and $C&gt;0$ is the compression-related parameter. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: The thalamus is a subcortical gray matter structure that plays a key role in relaying sensory and motor signals within the brain. Its nuclei can atrophy or otherwise be affected by neurological disease and injuries including mild traumatic brain injury. Segmenting both the thalamus and its nuclei is challenging because of the relatively low contrast within and around the thalamus in conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images. This paper explores imaging features to determine key tissue signatures that naturally cluster, from which we can parcellate thalamic nuclei. Tissue contrasts include T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, MR diffusion measurements including FA, mean diffusivity, Knutsson coefficients that represent fiber orientation, and synthetic multi-TI images derived from FGATIR and T1-weighted images. After registration of these contrasts and isolation of the thalamus, we use the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method for dimensionality reduction to produce a low-dimensional representation of the data within the thalamus. Manual labeling of the thalamus provides labels for our UMAP embedding from which k nearest neighbors can be used to label new unseen voxels in that same UMAP embedding. N -fold cross-validation of the method reveals comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods for thalamic parcellation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is being increasingly used as an alternative imaging modality for complete and non-invasive screening of the gastrointestinal tract. Although this is advantageous in reducing unnecessary hospital admissions, it also demands that a WCE diagnostic protocol be in place so larger populations can be effectively screened. This calls for training and education protocols attuned specifically to this modality. Like training in other modalities such as traditional endoscopy, CT, MRI, etc., a WCE training protocol would require an atlas comprising of a large corpora of images that show vivid descriptions of pathologies and abnormalities, ideally observed over a period of time. Since such comprehensive atlases are presently lacking in WCE, in this work, we propose a deep learning method for utilizing already available studies across different institutions for the creation of a realistic WCE atlas using StyleGAN. We identify clinically relevant attributes in WCE such that synthetic images can be generated with selected attributes on cue. Beyond this, we also simulate several disease progression scenarios. The generated images are evaluated for realism and plausibility through three subjective online experiments with the participation of eight gastroenterology experts from three geographical locations and a variety of years of experience. The results from the experiments indicate that the images are highly realistic and the disease scenarios plausible.

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: Accurate image reconstruction is crucial for photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA image with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground truth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and performance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access more measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction (CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of ground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach exploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller number of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a model-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce the measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data, by randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high proportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in both image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo solution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with minimum error of the image. Experimental results on in-vivo PACT dataset of mice demonstrate the potential of our unsupervised framework. In addition, our method shows a high performance (0.83 structural similarity index (SSIM) in the extreme sparse case with 13 channels), which is close to that of supervised scheme (0.77 SSIM with 16 channels). On top of all the advantages, our method may be deployed on different trainable models in an end-to-end manner. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>

        <b style="visibility: visible;">Abstract</b>: We present an open-source software pipeline to create patient-specific left atrial (LA) models with fibre orientations and a fibrosis map, suitable for electrophysiology simulations. The semi-automatic pipeline takes as input a contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiogram, and a late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) contrast magnetic resonance (CMR). Five operators were allocated 20 cases each from a set of 50 CMR datasets to create a total of 100 models to evaluate inter/intra-operator variability. Each output model consisted of (1) a labelled surface mesh open at the pulmonary veins (PV) and mitral valve (MV), (2) fibre orientations mapped from a diffusion tensor MRI human atlas, (3) fibrosis map from the LGE-CMR scan, and (4) simulation of local activation time (LAT) and phase singularity (PS) mapping. We evaluated reproducibility in our pipeline by comparing agreement in shape of the output meshes, fibrosis distribution in the LA body, and fibre orientations; simulations outputs were evaluated comparing total activation times of LAT maps, mean conduction velocity (CV), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of PS maps. Our workflow allows a single model to be created in 16.72 +/- 12.25 minutes. Results in this abstract are reported as inter/intra. Shape only differed noticeably with users' selection of the MV and the length of the PV from the ostia to the distal end; fibrosis agreement (0.91/0.99 ICC) and fibre orientation agreement (60.63/71.77 %) were high. LAT maps showed good agreement, the median of the absolute difference of the total activation times was 2.02ms/1.37ms. The average of the mean CV difference was -4.04mm/s / 2.1mm/s. PS maps showed a moderately good agreement with SSIM of 0.648/0.608. Although we found notable differences in the models due to user input, our tests show that operator variability was comparable to that of image resolution or fibre estimation. <br style="visibility: visible;"/></span>
